INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate contractor actions while implementing this PWS.  It is designed
to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Performance Requirements
Matrix in the task order.  The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish

The contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the task order.  The role
of the Government is quality assurance to ensure task order standards are achieved.

In this task order the quality control program is the driver for product quality.  The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program
of inspections and monitoring actions.  The first major step to ensuring a “self-correcting” task order is to ensure that the quality control
program approved at the beginning of the task order provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success.

Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will
ensure a robust quality assurance program.

SURVEILLANCE

The Government will evaluate the performance objectives through surveillance as reflected above by client reviews and acceptance of initial
plans and regular reviews of plans with the client to monitor processes and schedule.

STANDARD

The Contractor shall perform all work required in a satisfactory manner in accordance with the appropriate PWS paragraph.  The services shall
not be considered complete until all deficiencies have been corrected.  The COTR shall notify the Contracting Officer for appropriate action if
any of the above performance objectives are not in accordance with acceptable AQL.

PROCEDURES

The COTR will inspect all tasks required by the task order to ensure Contractor compliance with the task order requirements.  Inspection results
will be recorded in a Surveillance Log noting the date, time and result of inspection or verification.

The COTR will document all defects using a “Task Discrepancy Report (TDR)”.  The COTR will verbally notify the Contracting Officer (CO) of the
defect and will fax or email a copy of the TDR.  The COTR will ensure the TDR is completed in its entirety and coordinated through the
Contracting Officer.  The Contractor will also be furnished a copy of the TDR.  The Contractor shall furnish their response to the TDR.  The
Contractor’s response will address the accuracy and validity of the defect, planned corrective action and actions to prevent recurrence.  The
TDR information will be included when assessing the Contractor’s overall performance (i.e., past performance assessments, exercise of options,
etc.).

If any of the services do not conform to the task order requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in
conformity with task order requirements, at no increase in the task order amount.  The Contractor must correct the defect(s) within the
timeframes established in the PWS.  The COTR shall not certify satisfactory performance for the task order until all defects have been
corrected.

When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may:
   1) Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to task order requirements; and,

   2) Reduce the task order price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.

The COTR shall, in addition to providing documentation to the CO, maintain a complete quality assurance file.  The file will contain copies of
all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions relating to the Government’s performance of the quality assurance function, including
originals of all surveillance activity checklists.  All such records will be retained for the life of the task order.  The COTR shall forward
these records to the CO at completion or termination of the task order.


ACCEPTANCE OF SERVICES

Acceptance of services shall be based upon compliance with performance standards described in the PWS and surveillance procedures described in
this QASP.  Prior to approving/certifying any Contractor invoices, the COTR will verify that all invoiced services have been performed in
compliance with task order requirements.  The COTR shall not certify satisfactory performance for the task order until all defects have been
corrected.

Table 3:  Federal Information Security Safeguard Requirements – Summary

(T. Mitchell/D. Black:  11-19-07)

 

The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) (FISMA) requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to safeguard information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor (including subcontractor), or other source.  In addition, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, establishes minimum security controls in 17 security-related areas with regard to protecting Federal information systems.  These security controls are the management, operational and technical safeguards needed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of an information system and its information. 

 

The attached Table of Federal Information Security Safeguard Requirements (04-03-07) summarizes the FISMA information security safeguard requirements that an offeror must address in their proposal whenever a Statement of Work (SOW) requires a contractor (including any subcontractor) to (1) develop a Federal information system, (2) have the ability to access a Federal information system, or (3) host and/or maintain a Federal information system.  The following are descriptions of the information security safeguard requirements summarized in the table.  

 

1.      NIST SP 800-53 Self-Assessment

 

Whenever a SOW requires a contractor/subcontractor to (1) develop a Federal information system at the contractor’s/subcontractor’s facility or (2) host and/or maintain a Federal information system at the contractor’s/subcontractor’s facility, the offeror must submit with its proposal a completed Self-Assessment required by NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.  NIST 800-53 assesses information security assurance of the offeror's internal systems security.  This assessment is based on the Federal IT Security Assessment Framework and NIST SP 800-53 at:

                                                                NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 1

Annex 3: Baseline Security Controls for High-Impact Information Systems

	                           (506 KB)    (395 KB)

 

A contractor/subcontractor must annually update and re-submit its self-assessment to NIH following award in accordance with FISMA and OMB policy.  

 

2.      Draft Information System Security Plan (ISSP)

 

Whenever a SOW requires a contractor/subcontractor to (1) develop a Federal information system at the contractor’s/subcontractor’s facility or (2) host and/or maintain a Federal information system at the contractor’s/subcontractor’s facility, the offeror must submit with its proposal a draft Information System Security Plan (ISSP) using the most current template in Appendix A of NIST SP 800-18, Revision 1,  Guide to Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems, which is available at .  The details contained in an offeror’s draft ISSP must be commensurate with the size and complexity of the requirements of the SOW.

 

A contractor/subcontractor must update and resubmit its ISSP to NIH every three years following award or when a major modification has been made to the system.

   52.232-72 Limitation of Government’s Obligation.


    As prescribed in 332.705-2(b)(3), insert the following clause in solicitations and resultant incrementally funded fixed-price, time and
    materials or labor-hour contracts for severable services:
                                                LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT’S OBLIGATION (June 2010)
    (a) Contract line items 0001 and 0003 will be incrementally funded. For CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0003, the sum of $400,000.00 of the total price
    is the amount currently obligated, available for payment, and allotted to this contract. A projected allotment schedule is set forth in
    paragraph (i) of this clause. However, the Government may at any time allot additional funds for the performance of these contract line
    items.
    (b) For items identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable
    by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government’s convenience, approximates, but
    does not exceed, the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not required to continue work on those items beyond
    that point. The Government shall not be required in any event to pay the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for
    those items notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this
    clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of such termination of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a)
    above includes costs, profit, and estimated/negotiated termination settlement costs for those item(s).
    (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (i) of this clause, the Contractor shall notify the
    Contracting Officer in writing at least 90 days prior to the date when, in the Contractor’s best judgment, the work will reach the point at
    which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the
    total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable items. The Contractor notification shall provide: (1) the
    estimated date when that point will be reached; and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of
    applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (i) of this clause, or up to a mutually
    agreed upon substitute date. The notification shall also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that
    will be required for the timely performance of the items funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the
    allotment schedule in paragraph (i) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If, after such notification, additional funds are
    not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor’s notification, or by a mutually agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will
    terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for
    Convenience of the Government.”
    (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line items identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the
    parties will agree to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c)
    of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and mutually agreed date, and the contract will be modified
    accordingly.
    (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds by the dates indicated below in amounts sufficient for
    timely performance of the contract line items identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is
    delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are subsequently allotted, an equitable adjustment will
    be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the items, or in the time of
    delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact under the
    clause entitled “Disputes.”
    (f) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default.” This clause no
    longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable
    adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.

                                                            PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

                                              Remote Management / Monitoring for Microsoft Exchange

C.1.  BACKGROUND


      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) are located in Atlanta,
      Georgia. Both CDC and ATSDR are agencies under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). As the world’s leading public health
      agency, CDC has the responsibility for promoting health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury and disability.
      CDC works with States, local public health agencies and partners throughout the Nation and the world to accomplish this mission. CDC serves
      as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention and control methodologies, environmental health strategies, and health
      promotion and education activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United States and throughout the world.


      CDC is an information-intensive organization. Consequently, CDC’s dependence on information technology (IT), information systems,
      electronic communications, and digital media continues to grow rapidly and is essential to the mission and program accomplishment.


      The CDC is a geographically dispersed organization and the Information Technology Services Office (ITSO) is responsible for CDC-wide IT
      infrastructure services.  The current CDC mail system is currently hosted via an on premise private cloud model. The CDC infrastructure is
      located in Atlanta and replicated across two data centers (one at the Roybal Campus and one at the Chamblee campus).


      The architecture consists of Microsoft Exchange 2010 SP1 RU6, with Exchange online personal archives (currently being deployed) for all
      users.  The Exchange 2010 organization consists of 8 client access / hub transport role servers, 16 mailbox role servers, 2 edge servers
      and 4 ISA servers. All servers are using Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 as the server operating system. Microsoft Hyper-V is being used
      to host and virtualize many of the servers. The hardware used for the Exchange system is running on HP blade servers. There is one Exchange
      database availability group with two copies of the Exchange databases. The Exchange servers and clients use F5 Load Balancers for the
      hardware load balancing.


      CDC has approximately 40 terabytes (TB) of unique email stored on the fully redundant mail system. The SAN storage systems are redundant
      EMC CX4-960 infrastructure using the iSCSI protocol for disk access. The average CDC mailbox size is 500 megabytes (MB). There are 16,000
      users distributed throughout the United States at 23 different campuses and 2,500 international users in 28 remote sites.  There are a
      total of approximately 23,000 mailboxes on the system. All data is stored on EMC SAN’s including the exchange personal archive data. The
      system uses Microsoft Data Protection Manager R2 for its backup solution and disk snapshot backups are produced every 4 hours.


      CDC supports the Blackberry infrastructure with high availability Blackberry Enterprise Servers v5.0 at each data center supporting  6,300
      BlackBerry mobile devices hosted on 8 BES (4 active / 4 passive) servers and 4 Blackberry Administration Servers.  GOOD Technology Server
      is being used to allow a limited number of iOS and Android devices to send and receive CDC e-mail.


      Outlook is used as the standard email client.  Outlook Web Access (OWA) is used both on the internal and external network for remote access
      for users (remote access requires two factor authentication and/or HSPD-12 smartcard authentication).  All Outlook clients are 2010 and 90%
      of all users run outlook in cached mode.  


      After the migration of the mail system from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010 (completed in May 2011), CDC has experienced outstanding
      performance with the new mail environment and has established a robust system that provides stability, performance, and adaptability that
      must continue with any new contract.

performance period of this contract.  Such surveillance will be done according to standard inspection procedures or other contract provisions.
Any action taken by the contracting officer as a result of surveillance will be according to the terms of the contract.




C.8.   GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT (GFE)/ GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION (GFI)

The Government reserves the right to supply the Contractor, as Government-furnished property, office facilities/space, office supplies,
equipment, and materials determined by the Contracting Officer and the COTR to be necessary and in the best interest of the Government in the
performance of this contract. Title to all property furnished by the Government shall vest in the Government. The Government retains the right

    All travel must be authorized by the PO and be in compliance with the contract and all other applicable requirements. The Contractor shall
    ensure that the requested travel costs shall not exceed the amount authorized in this contract.
C.10.      Earned Value Management

Earned Value Management of this task shall consist of organizing and breaking down the complete scope of work into performance and deliverables
based on the tasks and the performance matrix.

In accordance with Earned Value Management (EVM) principles, success shall be measured by the completion of the deliverables, performance and
acceptance by the Government. As stated in the aforementioned guidelines, “The intent is to provide management information using existing
company resources and a scaled EVMS application that achieves the project requirements and is compliant the EVMS principles. EVMS scalability is
viewed as a spectrum employing the principles of EVMS guidelines to large complex and/or high risk projects allowing any project regardless of
size and complexity to realize the benefits of earned value management.” “The essence of Earned Value Management is that at some level of detail
within the Work Breakdown Structure, appropriate for the degree of technical, schedule and cost risk, or uncertainty associated with the
project, a target planned value is established for each scheduled element of work. As these elements of work are completed, their target planned
values are “earned.” As such, work progress is quantified and the earned value becomes a metric against which to measure both what has been
spent to perform the work and what was scheduled to have been accomplished.”

As part of the technical requirement of this project, the Government is requiring the Contractor to use EVM guidelines to effectively integrate
the scope of work with the performance matrix established for this project to achieve optimum project planning and control.  The principles to
be utilized by the Contractor shall be as outlined below:

    • Plan all activities for this project from award through completion.
    • Breakdown the project work scope into finite pieces that can be assigned a responsible person or group for the purpose of the control of
      deliverables and work objectives.
    • Integrate project work scope and schedule objectives into a performance measurement plan against which milestones can be measured and
      changes can be controlled.

Section G - Contract Administration Data

               1. Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Service) (Jan 2000)

                  (a)  Purpose

In accordance with FAR 42.1502, the Contractor's performance will be periodically evaluated by the Government, in order to provide current
information for source selection purposes.  These evaluations will therefore be marked “Source Selection Information.”

(b)  Performance Evaluation Period

The Contractor's performance will be evaluated at least annually.

(c)  Evaluators

The performance evaluation will be completed jointly by the Project officer and the Contracting officer.

(d)  Performance Evaluation Factors

The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with the attachment listed in Section J titled Performance Evaluation Report.

(e)  Contractor Review

A copy of the evaluation will be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation.  The contractor shall
submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information to the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days after receipt of the
evaluation.

(f)  Resolving Disagreements Between the Government and the Contractor

Disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation will be reviewed at a level above the Contracting Officer.  The ultimate conclusion
on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency.  Copies of the evaluation, contractor's response, and review comments, if
any, will be retained as part of the evaluation.

(g)  Release of Contractor Performance Evaluation Information

The completed evaluation will not be released to other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated.
Disclosure of such information could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position of the
contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations.

award decisions.  The information may be provided through interview and/or by sending the evaluation and comment document to the requesting
source selection official.

                  (a)   General

It is the objective of the Government to obtain complete and satisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of the specifications and
requirements of this contract.  The procedures set forth in the clause entitled Criteria for Deductions will be used by the Government in
determining monetary deductions for nonperformance of work under this contract, or for deficiencies in the performance of work, and supplements
the Inspection of Services clause contained in Section E of this contract.

(b)  Adjusting Payments

(1) Under the Inspection of Services clause of this contract, payments may be adjusted if any service does not conform with contract
requirements.  The Contracting Officer or a designated representative will inform the Contractor, in writing, of the type and dollar amount of
proposed deductions by the l0th workday of the month following the performance period for which the deductions are to be made.

(2)  The Contractor may, within 10 working days of receipt of the notification of the proposed deduction, present to the Contracting officer
specific reasons why any or all of the proposed deductions are not justified.  Reasons must be solidly based and must provide specific facts
that justify reconsideration and/or adjustment of the amount to be deducted.  Failure to respond within the 10 day period will be interpreted to
mean that the Contractor accepts the deductions proposed.

(3)  All or a portion of the final payment may be delayed or withheld until the Contracting Officer makes a final decision on the proposed
deduction.  If the Contracting Officer determines that any or all of the proposed deductions are warranted, the Contracting officer shall so
notify the Contractor, and adjust payments under the contract accordingly.

                  other stipulations of this contract.

(b)  No information, other than that which may be contained in an authorized modification to this contract, duly issued by the Contracting
Officer, which may be received from any person employed by the United States Government, or otherwise, shall be considered grounds for deviation
from any stipulation of this contract.

Performance of the work hereunder shall be subject to the technical directions of the designated COTR for this contract.

As used herein, technical directions are directions to the Contractor which fill in details, suggests possible lines of inquiry, or otherwise
completes the general scope of work set forth herein. These technical directions must be within the general scope of work, and may not alter the
scope of work or cause changes of such a nature as to justify an adjustment in the stated contract price/cost, or any stated limitation thereof.
In the event that the Contractor feels that full implementation of any of these directions may exceed the scope of the contract, he or she shall
notify the originator of the technical direction and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required report(s) within two (2) weeks
of the date of receipt of the technical direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction.  If the Contractor fails to provide
the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any technical direction exceeds the scope of the contract, then it shall be
deemed for purposes of this contract that the technical direction was within the scope. No technical direction, nor its fulfillment, shall alter
or abrogate the rights and obligations fixed in this contract.

The Government COTR is not authorized to change any of the terms and conditions of this contract. Changes shall be made only by the Contracting
Officer by properly written modification(s) to the contract.

The Government will provide the Contractor with a copy of the delegation memorandum for the COTR. Any changes in COTR delegation will be made by
the Contracting Officer in writing with a copy being furnished to the Contractor.

               1. FAR CDC0.H019 Security Clearances (Sep 2009)

                  CDC0_H019  Security Clearances

(a) Definitions.

“Employees” means both contractor and subcontractor employees unless otherwise noted:

The phrase “CDC owned or leased facilities” includes ATSDR, NIOSH/PRC/Pittsburgh, Pa.; NIOSH/Morgantown, W.V.; NIOSH/SRC/Spokane, WA;
NIOSH/Cincinnati, OH; NCHS/Research Triangle Park, NC; NCHS/Hyattsville, MD, NCID/Fort Collins, CO; NCID/Anchorage, AK, and NCID/San Juan, PR.

(b)  General

All contract employees who will be performing work under this contract on-site (i.e., in a CDC owned or leased facility) for a period exceeding
90 days in duration (45 days if employee is designated to work in Building 10, 15, or 17 at 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, or at CDC’s
Lawrenceville, GA facility) shall receive a favorable suitability determination prior to reporting to work at an on-site facility.  Any contract
employee(s) who cannot obtain a favorable suitability determination will not be permitted to work at an on-site facility (see paragraph B below
on temporary determinations.)

The Contractor shall be responsible for managing its workforce to ensure that sufficient contract employees who meet all suitability
requirements are available to perform the duties required under the contract.  New or replacement contract employees must have previously
received a favorable suitability determination in sufficient time to perform work at an on-site facility under the contract.  If it has been
over one (1) year since a contract employee has worked in a position on a Federal contract for which a security clearance was required, a new
National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) must be obtained.

(c)  Temporary Determinations/Clearances

The Contracting Officer may, as appropriate, authorize and grant temporary suitability determinations to contract employees.  However, the
granting of a temporary determination shall not be considered as assurance that full clearance will follow.  The granting of a temporary
determination shall not prevent, preclude or bar the withdrawal or termination of any temporary determination.  Prior to the Government's
issuance of a temporary determination, the Contractor shall obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide criminal records check
for all on-site contract employees.  The Contractor shall also obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide motor vehicle
violations check for any contract employee required to operate a motor vehicle as part of their duties under the contract at an on-site
facility.  All criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks shall cover a twelve (12) month period beginning twelve (12) months
prior to the date of the contract award. Criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks may be obtained through local state, county
or city law enforcement agencies at contract employees’ place of residence.  Where state-wide criminal record and motor vehicle violation
systems are not available, county-wide or city-wide checks may be substituted.  All substitutions shall be certified by the law enforcement
agency that a state-wide criminal record system is not available.

(d) Required Information for NACI Clearance:

Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall submit the completed forms specified below to the appropriate office as directed by the
Contracting Officer not later then 5 calendar days from the effective date of the contract. Items (1) through (6) must be completed by contract
employees who require access to on-site facilities in the performance of the contract.  Additionally, the contractor shall furnish, on a monthly
basis, item (7) (if the information requested in Item (7) is provided as part of the Contractor’s standard invoice, no additional submission is
required).  The Government will furnish the necessary forms to the Contractor.

(1) Two (2) completed Forms FD-258, "FBI Fingerprint Charts"***

(2) One (1) completed Standard Form 85, "Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions"

(3) One (1) completed "Declaration for Enrollment"

(4) One (1) resume or curriculum vitae or completed job application form

(5) One (1) copy of the state-wide criminal records check

(6) One (1) copy of the motor vehicle violations check (when applicable)

(7) A complete listing of all current Contractor and Subcontractor on-site employees by name, work location and employer.

*** The CDC, Human Resource Management Offices (HRMO) have the necessary equipment to complete fingerprint charts (FD-258).  The Contractor may
contact the Contracting Officer for arrangements regarding utilization of the HRMO fingerprinting equipment.  The fingerprint charts may also be
completed through a local state, county or city law enforcement agency at the employee's place of residence.

Using the required information specified above, a National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) will be processed by the CDC through the Office of
Personnel Management and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (OPM/FBI) on each contract employee who will be performing duties on-site.

(d)  Removal of Contractor Employees

The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility who has failed to
receive a suitability determination and whose continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest, inconsistent with the best
interests of security, or is identified as a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or operational mission of the
on-site facility and its population.   The Contracting Officer may also request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from
the on-site facility should it be determined that the individuals are being assigned to duty who have been disqualified for suitability reasons,
or who are found to be unfit for performing duties during their tour(s) of duty.  Contract employees who are requested to be removed from the on-
site facility are required to leave the work site immediately.

The Contracting Officer will make all determinations regarding the removal of any contract employee from the on-site facility, except under
certain conditions.  When a Contracting Officer is not available, either during the day or after normal business hours, or in situations where a
delay would not be in the best interest of the Government, or a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or
operational mission of the facility and its population, the Contracting Officer Technical Representative will have the authority to direct
immediate removal of the contractor employee from the on-site facility. The Contracting Officer shall subsequently provide the official
notification to the Contractor for removal of a contract employee from the CDC facility.  When removal is directed due to a non-suitability
determination as a result of the NACI, no further information will be provided.  If removal is directed for other reasons relating to specific
conduct of the employee during performance of the work, the Contracting Officer’s official notification will provide information as to these
reasons.


(e)  Identification Badges/Cardkey Access:

(1)  Identification Badges:

The Contractor shall require each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility, either through the
temporary clearance process or the formal NACI process, to display an identification badge as required and furnished by the CDC.  The Contractor
shall submit to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative a completed Identification Badge Request Form (CDC Form 0.1137) for each
contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility.  Contact the Contracting Officer Technical Representative
for details on additional procedures, specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Identification Badges for all other CDC
locations.

(2)  Cardkey Access:

Unescorted access to certain on-site facilities at CDC may only be gained through the use of a Cardkey.  If a contract employee has been
determined to need regular unescorted access to one of the Cardkey access designated areas, a Cardkey Request Form (CDC Form 0.834) must be
completed and submitted to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative for written approval.  Contact the Contracting Officer Technical
Representative for details of procedures and specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Cardkey Access.

(3)  Return of Identification Badges/Cardkeys

The Contractor shall arrange for the return of any employee identification badges and/or cardkeys immediately upon their separation of the
duties at the on-site facility.  Contact the Contracting Officer Technical Representative for location of the depositories for the return of
badges.  Cardkeys shall be returned to the appropriate Physical Security Activity Office.

(End of Clause)

               2. Dissemination of Information (May 1998)

                  No information related to data obtained under this contract shall be released or publicized without the prior written consent
                  of the Contracting Officer Technical Representative.

                  property, any additional supplies, equipment, and materials determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary and in the
                  best interest of the Government in the performance of this contract provided the property is furnished, or the Contractor is
                  notified of the Government’s intent to furnish it, prior to the Contractor’s commitment to acquire such items.

(b) Contractor-Acquired Property (CAP).   Regardless of the place of performance, when the costs of such items will be charged to the contract,
the Contractor must receive written consent from the Contracting Officer prior to purchase of any item which requires such consent under FAR
52.244-2 (see Section I, FAR 52.244-2, paragraphs (c), (d) and (e)).

(c) If performance of this contract is within and on Government facilities, and the Government-furnished property or contractor-acquired
property is for use only within or on the Government facilities, the control and accountable record keeping for such property shall be retained
by the Government (see FAR 52.245-1, Property Records).  The Contractor shall remain accountable for loss or damage, but will not be required to
submit an annual inventory or place its own bar codes on the items.  The Government will provide property labels and other identification for
contractor-acquired Government property under this paragraph.

(d) If performance of this contract is not within Government facilities, and there is either  Government-furnished property or contractor-
acquired property being used in performance of the work, the Contractor shall be responsible for the control and accountable record keeping for
such property in accordance with FAR Subpart 45.5 as supplemented by HHS Publication (OS) 74.115 entitled "Contractor’s Guide for Control of
Government Property," a copy of which will be provided upon request.

(e) The Chief of Material Management Branch, PGO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is hereby designated as the Property
Administrator for this contract. The Contractor agrees to furnish information regarding the Government property under this contract to the
Property Administrator, an authorized representative, or a duly designated successor(s). The Contractor shall identify each item of equipment
furnished by the Government to the Contractor or acquired by the Contractor using contract funds, with a suitable decal, tag, or other marking,
as prescribed by the Property Administrator, and shall follow the guidance set forth in the “Contractor’s Guide for Control of Government
Property.”

(End of Clause)


               4. Release of Information (Jul 1999)

                  The Contractor shall not, unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, release or provide any information or
                  interpretations concerning any plans or specifications prepared under this contract to prospective construction contractors,
                  manufacturers, or suppliers for their use in bidding or submitting quotations on the subject project.

Any cost estimates prepared by the Contractor under this contract for use either by the Government or the Contractor shall be consider
privileged information and will not be divulged to any third party.

(End of Clause)

               5. Lobbying Prohibition Using Federal Funds (Sep 2009)

                  CDC0_H021  Lobbying Prohibition Using Federal Funds

Per FAR 31.205-22, the contractor is hereby notified of the restrictions on the use of Department of Health and Human Service's funding for
lobbying of Federal, State and Local legislative bodies.

Section 1352 of Title 10, United Stated Code (Public Law 101-121, effective 12/23/89), among other things, prohibits a recipient (and their

employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any of the following covered Federal actions; the awarding of
any Federal contract; the making of any Federal grant; the making of any Federal loan; the entering into of any cooperative agreement; or the
modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.  For additional information of prohibitions against lobbying
activities, see FAR Subpart 3.8 and FAR Clause 52.203-12.

In addition, the current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this
Act shall be used, other than for normal and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for publicity or propaganda purposes, for the
preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, or video presentation designed to support, or
defeat legislation pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature except in presentation to the Congress, or any State or Local
legislative body itself.

The current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act also provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this Act
shall be used to pay the salary or expenses of any contract or grant recipient, or agent acting for such recipient, related to any activity
designed to influence legislation or appropriations pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature.

(End of Clause)


               6. Smoke Free Working Environment (May 2009)


CDC0_H022  Smoke Free Working Environment (May 2009)

In compliance with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations, all contractor personnel performing work within CDC/ATSDR
facilities shall observe the CDC/ATSDR smoke-free working environment policy at all times. This policy prohibits smoking in all CDC/ATSDR
buildings and in front of buildings which are open to the public. This policy is also applicable to contractor personnel who do not work full-
time within CDC/ATSDR facilities, but are attending meetings within CDC/ATSDR facilities.

(End of Clause)


               7. Smoke Free Environment Certification (Feb 2009)

                  CDC0_H055:  Smoke Free Environment Certification (February 2009)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure poses serious health risks to nonsmokers.
SHS exposure in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk for heart disease and lung cancer among adult nonsmokers. SHS has been
designated as a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) by the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that SHS is an
occupational carcinogen. There is no risk-free level of SHS exposure. Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating
buildings cannot eliminate this exposure.  SHS is an important preventable cause of death from cancer and other illnesses, and many Americans,
both adults and children, remain at significant risk from SHS exposure.

It is the CDC’s intent to protect the health of all CDC employees and reduce cancer and other serious health hazards caused by SHS exposure.
Therefore, all meetings and conferences organized and/or sponsored or co-sponsored by the CDC shall be held in a conference venue that provides
a smoke-free environment. A smoke-free conference venue is defined as a venue that makes ALL public places in the hotel and in all meeting
facilities smoke-free.  This includes, but is not limited to, meeting rooms, common areas such as lobbies and hallways, all indoor public
spaces, all indoor employee work areas, restaurants (including restaurant bar areas), and lounges.

Conferences include symposia, seminars, workshops, and any other organized and formal meeting lasting one or more days, where CDC personnel
assemble to exchange information and views or explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge.

CERTIFICATION: Offeror’s acceptance of any resulting contract certifies that the meeting/conference venue provided is “smoke-free” and that all
CDC personnel attending said meeting/conference will be doing so in a smoke-free environment.

(End of Clause)

               8. Security, Health and Safety, Conduct


The Contractor shall ensure that all staff meets the physical security requirements specified by the CDC Office of Security and Emergency
Preparedness (OSEP), regarding identification and access to CDC physical facilities.  The Contractor shall ensure that all employees adhere to
the Government Standards of Conduct, the nonsmoking policy at CDC and all other health, safety, parking policies and other requirements when
performing work on CDC facilities or visiting CDC staff at CDC facilities.

Urgent Alerts: The Contractor shall immediately or as soon as practical but no later than 24 hours, report any security event (physical,
information, or personnel) to the CDC Contracting Officer Technical Representative, or CDC Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or other
CDC official.  Security events as used herein include unauthorized access, disclosure, removal, destruction, or alteration of any CDC asset
including data, information, hardware, software, or system.  Security events include actions that compromise the security, integrity, or
vulnerability of CDC assets or place them at higher risk through electronic, physical, or personnel actions.

If contractor-provided or supported services are interrupted, the Contractor shall immediately report the nature of the problem or reason of
service interruption to the applicable CDC Contracting Officer Technical Representative.  In addition, the Contractor shall estimate the
projected resolution time and communicate it to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative.  Subsequently the Contractor shall report
steps to be taken to preclude a reoccurrence.

(End of Clause)


               9. Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor and Contractor Employees (Mar 2006)


   a) The contractor shall prepare and submit a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government
      information or the commencement of work at CDC.


   b)  The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II , is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be
      filled by contractor’s employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor’s
      employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of
      other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor’s work with the CDC), and members of the public.
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states “All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones,
      and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such
      to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the
      judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced
      by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed.”

   c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the
      identification requirements.

   d) During the contract performance period, the Contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors’ employees

                                                 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
                                                       Contractor Non-Disclosure Agreement

I. Non-public Information
 
[Name of contractor] understands that in order to fulfill the responsibilities pursuant to [Contract name and number] between the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and [Name of CDC contractor] dated [date], employees of [contractor] will have access to non-public information,
including confidential and privileged information contained in government-owned information technology systems. For purposes of this agreement,
confidential information means government information that is not or will not be generally available to the public. Privileged information means
information which cannot be disclosed without the prior written consent of the CDC.
 
In order to properly safeguard non-public information, [contractor] agrees to ensure that prior to being granted access to government
information or the commencement of work for the CDC, whichever is applicable, all employees will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) provided
by the CDC prior to beginning work for the CDC. Contractor agrees to submit to the contracting official the original signed copies of NDAs
signed by the contractor’s employees in accordance with the instructions provided by the contracting official. Failure to provide signed NDAs in
accordance with this agreement and instructions provided by the contracting official could delay or prevent the employee from commencing or
continuing work at the CDC until such agreement is signed and returned to the contracting official.
 
Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner
or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee any non-public information that the employee may obtain in
connection with the performance of the employee’s responsibilities to the CDC.
 
II. Procurement-Sensitive Information
 
Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner
or to any extent, to any individual, other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained while in
connection with fulfilling the employee’s responsibilities at the CDC. For purposes of this agreement, procurement-sensitive information
includes, but is not limited to, all information in Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Contract (RFC), and Requests for Proposal (RFP);
Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all documents, conversations,
discussions, data, correspondence, electronic mail (e-mail), presentations, or any other written or verbal communications relating to,
concerning, or affecting proposed or pending solicitations or awards; procurement data; contract information plans; strategies; source selection
information and documentation; offerors’ identities; technical and cost data; the identity of government personal involved in the solicitation;
the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the award determination process; and any other information that may provide an unfair
competitive advantage to a contractor or potential contractor if improperly disclosed to them, or any of their employees.
 
Contractor understands and agrees that employee access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will
preclude contractor from becoming a competitor for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information. Therefore, if an employee participates in
any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assists in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtains
any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing duties at the CDC, contractor understands and agrees that contractor can
be excluded from competing for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information.


III.    Identification of Non-Government Employees
 
Contractor understands that its employees are not agents of the Government. Therefore, unless otherwise directed in writing by the CDC,
contractor agrees to assist and monitor employee compliance with the following identification procedures:
 
        A.      At the beginning of interactions with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities, members of the public, or the
           media (when such communication or interaction relates to the contractor’s work with the CDC), contractors’ employees will identify
           themselves as an employee of a contractor.
        B.      Contractors’ employees will include the following disclosures in all written communications, including outgoing electronic mail
           (e-mail) messages, in connection with contractual duties to the CDC:
                 Employee’s name
                 Name of contractor
                 Center or office affiliation
                 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
        C.     At the beginning of telephone conversations or conference calls, contractors’ employees will identify themselves as an employee
           of a contractor.
        D.      Contractors should not wear any CDC logo on clothing, except for a CDC issued security badge while carrying out work for CDC or
           on CDC premises. The only other exception is when a CDC management official has granted permission to use the CDC logo.
        E.      Contractors’ employees will program CDC voice mail message to identify themselves as an employee of a contractor.
            
I understand that federal laws including, 18 U.S.C. 641 and 18 U.S.C. 2071, provide criminal penalties for, among other things, unlawfully
removing, destroying or converting to personal use, or use of another, any public records. Contractor acknowledges that contractor has read and
fully understands this agreement.

employee, any non-public information that I may obtain in connection with the performance of my responsibilities to the CDC.
 
II. Procurement-Sensitive Information
 
I further agree that unless I have prior written permission from the CDC, I will not disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any
manner or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained in
connection with the performance of my responsibilities to the CDC. I specifically agree not to disclose any non-public, procurement-sensitive
information to employees of my company or any other organization unless so authorized in writing by the CDC. For purposes of this agreement,
procurement-sensitive information includes, but is not limited to, all information in Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Contract (RFC), and
Requests for Proposal (RFP); Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all

employees.
 
I understand and agree that my access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will preclude me, my
current employer, or a future employer from becoming a competitor for any resulting government acquisition derived from this information.
Therefore, if I participate in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assist in developing any procurement-sensitive
information, or otherwise obtain any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing my duties at the CDC, I understand and
agree that I, my current employer, and any future employer(s) can be excluded from competing for any resulting acquisitions.

 
III. Special Non-Disclosure Clause for Contractors with Access to CDC Grants Management and Procurement-Related Information Technology Systems
 
In addition to complying with the non-disclosure requirements and safeguards stated above, I understand that my authorization to use CDC’s
grants management and procurement systems is strictly limited to the access and functions necessary for the performance of my responsibilities
to the CDC and which have been approved in advance by the CDC. I understand that I am not authorized to enter procurement requests for any
requirements pertaining to contracts or subcontracts held by me or my employer.
 
IV.    Identification as a Non-Government Employee
 
I understand that as an employee of a government contractor, I represent an independent organization and I am not an agent of the Government.
Therefore, I agree that unless I have prior written authorization from the CDC, I will, at the beginning of interactions with CDC employees,

              10. HHS Standard Security Configuration Language (Jan 2009)

                  Contractor computers containing HHS data shall be configured with the applicable Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC)
                  (http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/index.cfm), and shall have and maintain the latest operating system patch level and anti-virus
                  software level.

1. The Contractor shall apply approved security configurations to information technology that is used to process information on behalf of the
   Department, its Operating Divisions (OPDIVs) and Staff Divisions (STAFFDIVs).


   Such approved security configurations shall be identified jointly by the OPDIV/STAFFDIV Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR)
   and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Approved security configurations include, but are not limited to, those published by the
   Department, by the OPDIV/STAFFDIV, and by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at http://checklist.nist.gov.
   OPDIVs/STAFFDIVs may have security configurations that are more stringent than the minimum baseline set by the Department or NIST.  When
   incorporating such security configuration requirements in solicitations and contracts, the OPDIV CISO shall be consulted to determine the
   appropriate configuration reference for a particular system or services acquisition.


2. The Contractor shall ensure applications operated on behalf of the Department or OPDIV/STAFFDIV are fully functional and operate correctly on
   systems configured in accordance with the above configuration requirements.  The Contractor shall use Security Content Automation Protocol
   (SCAP)-validated tools with FDCC Scanner capability to ensure its products operate correctly with FDCC configurations and do not alter FDCC
   settings. The Contractor shall test applicable product versions with all relevant and current updates and patches installed. The contractor
   shall ensure currently supported versions of information technology (IT) products meet the latest FDCC major version and subsequent major
   versions.

   (a) be included with the purchase of servers, desktops, and laptops; and (b) comply with FAR Subpart 4.13, Personal Identity Verification.


6. The Contractor shall ensure all its subcontractors which perform work under this contract (at all tiers) comply with the above requirements.

(End of Clause)

              11. HHS Standard Security Encryption Language (Jan 2009)

                  The Contractor shall use FIPS 140-2 (as amended) compliant encryption to protect all instances of HHS sensitive information
                  during storage and transmission.


   1. The Contractor shall verify that the selected encryption product has been validated under the Cryptographic Module Validation Program
      (http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/) to confirm compliance with FIPS 140-2 (as amended).  The Contractor shall provide a written copy of the
      validation documentation to both the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).


   2. The Contractor shall use the Key Management Key on the HHS personal identification verification (PIV) card; or alternatively, the
      Contractor shall establish and use a key recovery mechanism to ensure the ability for authorized personnel to decrypt and recover all

   5. The Contractor shall ensure that all of its employees, subcontractors (at all tiers), and employees of each subcontractor, who perform work
      under this contract/subcontract, comply with the above requirements.

              12. Automated Information Systems Security Requirements

    (a) General.  CDC has instituted an Automated Information System (AIS) Security program as defined in the DHHS Information Resources
Management (IRM) Manual, Part 6, AIS Security Program Handbook and other applicable regulations, requirements, and restrictions pertaining to
AIS security.  By accepting this contract, the Contractor providing application systems or Federal information Processing (FIP) resources to
CDC, a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), agrees to comply with the applicable AIS security policy.  The
Contractor shall include this requirement in any subcontract awarded under this prime contract.  Failure to comply with said requirements may
constitute cause for termination for default.

    (b) Employee Security Clearances.  Contractor employees in AIS-related positions must comply with the criteria for assigning risk level
designations in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Section 731, “Personnel Suitability”.  A copy will be provided upon award of the contract.
Risk level designations will be made by CDC’s Information Systems Security Officer and CDC Co-Project Officers.

    Contractor employees assigned to a 6C (high risk) position are subject to a Background Investigation (BI).  Contractor employees assigned to
a level 5C (Moderate Risk) position, with no previous investigation and approval, must undergo a National Agency Check and Inquiry Investigation
plus a Credit Check (NACIC), or possibly a Limited Background Investigation (LBI).  Contractor employees assigned to a Level 1C position (Low
Risk or Non-sensitive) are subject to a National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI).  Contractor employees who have previously been investigated
and approved (by another approved agency or organization under appropriate authority for processing investigations), within the past five years,
may only need to be subject to an updated or upgraded investigation.

    Verification of these clearances, e.g., duplicate copies of processed forms verifying processing under Section 3(a) of Executive Order
10450, must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for verification.  The contractor must submit to the Contracting Officer copies of the
following forms for employees who do not already have the required clearances:
       (1) Standard Form 85-P, “Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions”
       (2) Standard Form FD 258, “Finger Print Form”
    Personnel without required security clearances cannot perform any contract work unless they are escorted by Government personnel while on
site.

    (c) Non-Disclosure Agreement Requirements.  Contractor employees must sign a written non-disclosure agreement before data and information
otherwise exempt from public disclosure (e.g. Privacy Act or Data Collected Under an assurance of Confidentiality) may be disclosed to them.  A
sample disclosure statement is provided herein.  In addition to the non-disclosure agreement, the Contractor shall establish and follow the
security precautions considered by CDC to be necessary to ensure proper and confidential handling of data and information.  This information is
more specifically addressed in the DHHS Automated Information Systems Security Program (AISSP) Handbook.

    (d) Compliance Monitoring.  Upon five (5) days advance notice in writing, the Contractor shall afford CDC personnel full, free, and
uninhibited access to all facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases which the
Contractor may develop or employ in the conduct of this contract for the purpose of carrying out a program to ensure continued efficacy and
efficiency of safeguards against threats and hazards to data security, integrity, confidentiality, and timely access by authorized persons.  If
new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the Government or the Contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to
function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party.  Changes or corrections to existing
safeguards or institution of new safeguards are subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.  The Government reserves the right to make the
final determination of appropriateness of such changes or corrections.  The Government’s liability is limited to an equitable adjustment of cost
for such changes or corrections, and the Government shall not be liable for claims of loss of business, damage to reputation, or damages of any
other kind arising from discovery of new or unanticipated threats or hazards, or any public or private disclosure thereof.

    (e) Permitting Access to Secure Systems.  While the CDC E-mail system is designed secure, i.e. it employs encryption technology on all
message traffic, users are not guaranteed absolute privacy of their E-mail.  The Contractor shall not allow employees to use files (script) for
logging onto systems that contain the employee’s password(s).  Contractor multi-user systems used to process data under this contract shall use
the following pre-logon warning message:

       WARNING          WARNING          WARNING
    ***********************************************************
THIS COMPUTER IS OPERATED BY/FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO AND/OR USE OF THIS COMPUTER SYSTEM IS A VIOLATION OF LAW AND
PUNISHABLE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 18 U.S.C. 1029, 18 U.S.C. 1030, AND OTHER APPLICABLE STATUTES.

      The Department of Health and Human Services considers E-mail messages, as part of government-provided E-mail systems, to be Government
property.  While all employees, including system administrators, are expressly prohibited from violating the security of the E-mail system, as
well as other information system security protections, by intercepting and/or reading E-mail traffic arbitrarily, there may be occasions due to
technical, administrative, or legal reasons for systems administrators to access messages upon authorization by two concurring senior management
officials.


      System Administrators shall obtain a written authorization before taking actions that would allow anyone other than the intended recipient
to read the contents of an e-mail message or messages or obtain access to any other password-protected electronic system or file.  Improper and
unauthorized access of other person’s e-mail messages or other secure information systems is a violation of federal regulation and policy and
may also violate other federal security and privacy laws.  Such actions will result in appropriate legal or contractual action.


    Under no circumstances is a contractor permitted to make any use of Government computer equipment, software, or supplies for purposes other
than performance of this contract.

    (f) Employee Resignation or Termination.  When an employee no longer requires access to the system (if the employee leaves the company or
the contract), the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) within two working days.  At contract
completion or termination, the contractor shall provide a status list of all users and note if any users still require access to the system to
perform work under any other contract.   Any group accounts or other means of gaining access to the system shall be listed also, this includes
maintenance accounts and security bypasses.  If an employee is fired or leaves the contract or company under adverse conditions, the contractor
shall notify the COTR before the employee is removed, if possible.  If circumstances make advance notification impracticable, the contractor
shall notify the COTR immediately after dismissing the employee, so that the Government may terminate that employee’s access to CDC systems.
When an employee leaves the contract, the contractor shall ensure that all files are disposed of via transfer to another user, archive,
destruction, etc. as appropriate.  The Contractor shall report such disposition in a separate section of the summary monthly report.

    (g) Contract Closeout.  Upon completion of the work of this contract, or of each task order issued under the contract, including delivery of
all required deliverables, the contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a statement certifying that the data processed during the
performance of this contract has been purged from all data storage components of its computer facilities, including system backups, and no
output has been retained by the contractor.  If immediate purging is not possible, the contractor shall certify that any CDC data remaining in
any storage component, including system backup, will be safeguarded to prevent any unauthorized disclosure.

    (h) Miscellaneous.  The details of any security safeguards that the contractor may design or develop under this contract are the property of
the Government and shall not be published or disclosed in any manner without the Contracting Officer’s written consent.  Likewise, the details
of any security safeguards that may be revealed to the Contractor by the Government in the course of performance under this contract shall not
be published or disclosed in any manner without the Contracting Officer’s written consent.  Any information made available in any format shall
be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract.  Information contained in such materials shall not be divulged or
made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of this contract.  Disclosure to anyone other than an
authorized officer or employee of the contractor shall require written approval of the Contracting Officer.  Other DHHS agency issued task
orders shall include the provisions addressing Automated Information Systems Security Requirements.

    Any information with personal identifiers shall be accounted for upon receipt and properly stored before, during and after processing.  In
addition, all related output shall be given the same level of protection as required for the source materials.

    The Government reserves the right to conduct, or employ a third party to conduct, security auditing, penetration testing, and other related
measures on a recurring basis to ensure sufficient security practices and controls are in place and working effectively.  The contractor will
take necessary corrective actions as soon as practical to address any vulnerability identified or inconsistencies with the contractor's approved
security plan or other requirements of this contract.  Emergency risk mitigation actions may be required by the Government if deemed warranted.
Failure to comply could result in suspension or termination of tasks where the risks to the Government's assets and interests are deemed
sufficiently compromised or at risk.

(End of Clause)
              13. Observance of Legal Holidays and Administrative Leave (Government Facilities Performance) (Jan 2000)

                  (a) Holidays

Government personnel observe the following listed days as holidays:

Washington's Birthday
Memorial Day
Independence Day

The Contractor shall observe the above holidays on the date observed by the Government.  Observance of such days by Government personnel shall
not “on-its-face” be cause for an additional period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract.
Contractor employees performing duties within Government facilities are automatically relieved from duty by virtue of the fact that Government
employees are dismissed early or given the day off, (with the exception of 24-hour/day service requirements).  No form of holiday or other
premium compensation will be reimbursed; however, this does not preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work.

(b) Unscheduled Facility Closures

In the event the Government facilities are closed due to inclement weather, potentially hazardous conditions, and other special circumstances,
contractor personnel assigned to work within those facilities are automatically dismissed.  In this instance, the cost of salaries and wages for
the period of any such excused absence may be charged in the same manner as the effected employee’s regular time (direct cost for those
employees whose salaries are normally a direct cost; indirect cost for those employees whose salaries are normally an indirect cost), provided
that such charges are in accordance with the contractor's accounting system/policy.  In each instance, the Contractor agrees to continue to
provide sufficient personnel to perform round-the-clock requirements of critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by
the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or his duly appointed representative.

(End of Clause)


              14. Identification of Data

The Contractor shall identify the technical data delivered to the Government as required by this contract with the number of the contract and
the name and address of the Contractor and subcontractor, should that be the case, who generated the data.

(End of Clause)


              15. Data Subject to Confidentiality Requirements

(a) EIT Accessibility
Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic
and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with
the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board
(also referred to as the Access Board) in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/.
The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.
The Section 508 standards applicable to the order are identified in the Statement of Work/Task Order. The contractor must provide a written
Section 508 conformance certification due at the end of each order/contract exceeding $50,000 when the order/contract duration is one year or
less. If it is determined by the Government that EIT products and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described
accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the
vendors Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.  In the event of a modification(s) to this
contract/order, which adds new EIT products and services or revises the type of, or specifications for, products and services the Contractor is
to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit
a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template to assist the Government in determining that the EIT products and services support
Section 508 accessibility requirements. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be
found at http://508.hhs.gov .
Prior to the Contracting Officer exercising an option for a subsequent performance period/additional quantity or adding incremental funding for
a subsequent performance period under this contract, as applicable, the Contractor must provide a Section 508 Annual Report to the Contracting
Officer and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR). Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer in writing, the
Contractor shall provide the cited report in accordance with the following schedule:
    • Annually, or
    • as required by CDC Enterprise Project Lifecycle requirements.
 Instructions for completing the report are available at: http://508.hhs.gov/ under the heading Vendor Information and Documents”. The
Contractor's failure to submit a timely and properly completed report may jeopardize the Contracting Officer’s exercising an option or adding
incremental funding, as applicable.
(b) Document Accessibility:  This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed
on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or
internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be
placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site.
Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text,
audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to
access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors1) or
consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable
Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, checklists for specific file types as listed at
http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/index.html.  . Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as
set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or
communications material.

              20. Non-Government Personnel

   a) Contractor Support – The Government plans to use private companies to provide assistance during this acquisition. Private contractor  staff
      will provide support, and consequently, private contractor staff may have access to the  information  contained  in  your  proposal.  These
      contractors are subject to appropriate conflict of interest rules, standards  of  conduct,  nondisclosure  agreements  and  confidentiality
      restrictions.

(b) Prohibitions - Non-government support is prohibited from participating in proposal rating, ranking, or recommending the selection of a
      source.  Also, they are not normally allowed to participate in oral presentations or discussions, but may attend if requested by the
      chairperson(s).  Non-government support is not normally allowed to participate in government decision making meetings such as SSEB or SSAC
      sessions, or SSA briefings, unless invited by the chairperson(s) to be present during a particular portion of the meeting when they may be
      called upon to provide specific technical information.

(c) Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) - OCI clauses are included in the contracts under which non-governmental technical support is
      provided to this acquisition.  The OCI clauses require the companies and individual non-government support contractors to protect Offeror
      proprietary data and government acquisition information and prohibit the companies from otherwise participating as an Offeror, a
      subcontractor, or as a consultant to an Offeror/subcontractor in relation to this acquisition participation.

              21. Offshoring

The resulting contract generally prohibits the provision of services under this contract from sources outside the U.S. (typically referred to as
offshoring).  This prohibition does not extend to commercial products used in relation to the contract, such as commercial hardware or software
that may have been developed or manufactured in non-U.S. countries except as otherwise prohibited by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
However, specific task orders under the resulting contract may explicitly authorize services to be performed outside the U.S. in certain
circumstances such as when CDC is conducting work in a non-U.S. country and local IT service staff would be more advantageous.  Appropriate
security measures and controls will be specified in such task orders.


(End of provision)


              22. Prohibition on the Use of Appropriated Funds for Lobbying Activities (Jul 1999)

                  The contractor is hereby notified of the restrictions on the use of Department of Health and Human Service's funding for
                  lobbying of Federal, State and Local legislative bodies.

Section 1352 of Title 10, United Stated Code (Public Law 101-121, effective 12/23/89), among other things, prohibits a recipient (and their
subcontractors) of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from using appropriated funds (other than profits from a federal
contract) to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or
employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any of the following covered Federal actions; the awarding of
any Federal contract; the making of any Federal grant; the making of any Federal loan; the entering into of any cooperative agreement; or the
modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.  For additional information of prohibitions against lobbying
activities, see FAR Subpart 3.8 and FAR Clause 52.203-12.

In addition, the current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this
Act shall be used, other than for normal and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for publicity or propaganda purposes, for the
preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, or video presentation designed to support, or
defeat legislation pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature except in presentation to the Congress, or any State or Local
legislative body itself.

The current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act also provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this Act
shall be used to pay the salary or expenses of any contract or grant recipient, or agent acting for such recipient, related to any activity
designed to influence legislation or appropriations pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature.

CDC is not required to grant the contractor access to CDC information technology resources (e.g., computers, network, email, etc.).  If CDC were
to agree to grant the contractor, or any of its employees, access to CDC information technology resources at any point in time, it would be the
contractor's responsibility to ensure that all of its employees to be granted such access complete any additional required information security
courses that CDC specifies prior to gaining or utilizing such access.  It would also be the contractor's responsibility to ensure that such
employees have met any other CDC and federal requirements, such as, for example, completion of background checks, before gaining or utilizing
access to CDC information technology resources.

The CDC desires to take advantage of technology changes that it anticipates will occur over the contract period and that will contribute to the
accomplishment of its strategic goals.  The Contractor shall review the system configuration (including hardware and software) and may propose
changes at any time.

In addition, the CDC may from time to time solicit, and the Contractor is encouraged to propose independently, engineering changes to the
equipment, software specifications, or other requirements of the contract or task orders.  These changes may be proposed to save money, to
improve performance, to save energy, or to satisfy increased data processing services requirements.  If the proposed changes are acceptable to
both parties, the Contractor shall submit a price change proposal to the CDC for evaluation.  Those proposed changes that are acceptable to the
CDC will be processed as modifications to the contract or task order.

At a minimum the following information shall be submitted by the Contractor with each proposal to implement a proposed change in accordance with
the provisions of the previous paragraph.
    • A description of the difference between the existing contract and the proposed change, and the comparative advantage and disadvantage of
      each.
    • Itemized requirements of the contract which shall be changed if the proposal is adopted, and the proposed revision to the contract for each
      such change.
    • An estimate of the changes in performance and cost, if any, that will result from adoption of the proposal.
    • An evaluation of the effects the proposed change would have on collateral costs to the CDC, such as Government-furnished property costs,
      costs of related items, and costs of maintenance and operation.
    • A statement of the time by which the change order adopting the proposal shall be issued so as to obtain the maximum benefits of the changes
      during the remainder of this contract.  Also, any effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule shall be identified.
Change proposals submitted to the Contracting Officer or COTR will be processed expeditiously.  The CDC will not be liable for proposal
preparation costs or any delay in acting upon any proposal submitted pursuant to this clause.  The Contractor has the right to withdraw, in
whole or in part, any change proposal not accepted by the CDC within the period specified in the change proposal.  The decision of the
Contracting Officer or COTR as to the acceptance of any such proposal under this contract shall be final and shall not be subject to the
“Disputes” clause of this contract, FAR 52.233-1 in Section I of this contract.

The Contracting Officer or COTR may accept any change proposal submitted pursuant to this clause by giving the Contractor written notice
thereof.  This written notice may be given by issuance of a modification to this contract.  Unless and until a modification is executed to
incorporate a change proposal under this contract, the Contractor shall remain obligated to perform in accordance with the terms of the existing
contract.
If a change proposal submitted pursuant to this clause is accepted and applied to this contract, an equitable adjustment in the contract price
and in any other affected provisions of this contract shall be made.

The Contractor is requested to identify specifically any information contained in the change proposal which the Contractor considers
confidential and/or proprietary and which the Contractor prefers not to be disclosed to the public.  The identification of information as
confidential and/or proprietary is for information purposes only and shall not be binding on the CDC to prevent disclosure of such information.
Contractors are advised that such information may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. § 552).

              47. Security Processes

Contractor/subcontractor employees shall comply with the HHS criteria for the assigned position sensitivity designations prior to performing any
work under this contract. The following exceptions apply:
Levels 5 and 1: Contractor/subcontractor employees may begin work under the contract after the Contractor has submitted the name, position and
responsibility of the employee to the Project Officer.

The Personnel Security Section (PSS) shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer if the fingerprint results come back inconclusive. The
Contracting Officer shall communicate the results to the Project Officer and the Contractor. The Contractor may require the employee to be re-
fingerprinted or may substitute another employee to be fingerprinted (if not already fingerprinted). The process shall continue until favorable
results are received.

The PSS shall provide the names of Contractor personnel who do not favorably pass the NACI to the Contracting Officer and Project Officer. Upon
receipt of such a list, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor and require the Contractor to immediately remove any contract
employee on the list from the on-site facility who failed to receive a favorable suitability determination. Such a demand shall be made because
that employee’s continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest, inconsistent with the best interests of security, or may be
identified as a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being, or operational mission of the on-site facility and its
population. The Contracting Officer may also require the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility should
it be determined that the individual who is being assigned to duty has been disqualified for suitability reasons, or who is found to be unfit
for performing duties during their tour(s) of duty. Contract employees who require removal from the on-site facility shall leave the work site
immediately.

After normal business hours, or in situations where a delay would not be in the best interest of the Government, or a potential threat to the
health, safety, security, general well being, or operational mission of the facility and its population, the Contracting Officer shall have the
authority to direct immediate removal of the Contractor employee from the on-site facility.

The Contracting Officer shall subsequently provide the official, written notification to the Contractor documenting the reason for removal of
the Contractor employee from the CDC facility. When removal is directed due to an unfavorable NACI report constituting a non-suitability
determination, no further information shall be provided. If removal is directed for other reasons relating to specific conduct of the employee
during performance of the work, the Contracting Officer’s official, written notification shall provide information as to these reasons.

EVALUATION:

This procurement is being conducted under FAR 15, and the evaluation procedures described in this document.  The Government will place the order
with the offeror that represents the overall best value to meet the Government’s needs.  Best value is defined as the expected outcome of an
acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement, in accordance with FAR
2.101.

The Government will make best value determinations as part of the evaluation and selection process.  Technical factors will receive paramount
importance in making the award decisions.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than
cost or price.

A proposal that has no weaknesses and no particular strengths above and beyond meeting the basic requirements defined in the RFP for a
particular evaluation criterion, will receive less than the full credit available on that element.  To achieve the full credit for a criterion,
the proposal must go well beyond the requirement by offering exceptionally innovative or particularly well thought out or insightful methods,
procedures, solutions or new opportunities for major improvements.


EVALUATION FACTORS:

The technical evaluation criteria for the RFP are as follows:

|Evaluation Criteria                                                   |Maximum Points of Evaluation Criteria                                 |

     2. PMP (Project Management Professional) Certification
     3.  Blackberry Certified Systems Administrator

The factors are listed in descending order of importance.

A.  Project Approach and Performance Excellence. This section shall evaluate the Government’s confidence of the offeror's proposal in terms of
meeting the contract requirements.  This evaluation shall consider the offeror’s understanding of the PWS (as demonstrated by the offeror’s
analysis of the requirements) and their overall approach of how they plan to accomplish the required services (as demonstrated by the proposed
techniques or methodology to be employed).  Please identify any unique technical approaches that will be used such as any real time monitoring
system, any new exchange enhancement tool, or any Windows 2010 virtualization technology.  Overall, the evaluation shall consider the
feasibility of the offeror’s proposal, the CWBS, the probability (risk) of performance success, and the offeror’s ability to do what is
proposed, meet the contractual timeframes and the 99.9% Exchange Server availability.

B.  Management Plan and Capability.  This section shall evaluate the Government’s confidence in how well the offeror’s proposal demonstrates
that the offeror can effectively manage all aspects of contract performance.  This factor shall evaluate offeror’s overall management approach
and shall consider such elements as (but not limited to): 1.) how well the management plan demonstrates that the work effort will be managed
effectively and establishes well-defined lines of authority, responsibility and communication; and 2.) the establishment of management
techniques that will facilitate the early identification and resolution of problems and the prompt response to changes.

This factor shall also consider the offeror’s Staffing Plan.  This evaluation shall consider such elements as (but not limited to): 1.) given
the requirements and design please identify how you will provide management and monitoring services for CDC’s E-mail system. and 2.) the
offeror’s ability to react and adjust to new technology and service interruptions.

C.  Similar Experience.  This section the Government shall evaluate how well the offeror’s proposal demonstrates that the offeror has similar
experience managing tasks/contracts similar in size and scope.  This factor shall evaluate offeror’s similar experience and shall consider such
elements as (but not limited to): 1) Offeror has experience secure, encrypted remote management with the ability to monitor and provide 24x7
Exchange support and 2.) Skill Sets Identified in PWS section 8.

D. Assumptions and Conditions.   This section the Government shall evaluate assumptions or conditions relating to their Project Plan and Other
Qualification Information.  The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal that includes any assumption or condition that adversely
impacts or affects the Government’s requirement.

E.  Past Performance.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will review “how well the offeror has performed” on other relevant
comparable projects.  This will be rated as pass or fail.  Past performance will be evaluated to assess its relative merit with respect to the
current requirement and then as compared to that of competing offerors.  The evaluation shall be based on current and past performance
information furnished by the offeror as well as information from other available sources, such as (but not limited to) government past
performance data bases, other government agencies, suppliers, subcontractors, or customers of the offeror.

If an offeror is determined to have no past performance then they will be assigned a neutral rating.  The lack of performance history shall not
penalize or otherwise disqualify an offeror; however, among other things, an offeror with no performance history may be considered less
favorably than an offeror with favorable performance history during the best value tradeoff process.   If no performance history please state no
history.

10. PRICE/COST EVALUATION

The offeror’s written cost/price proposal  Part I Tabs A through D) shall be evaluated to determine cost reasonableness and the associated risk
considering the contract type.  Prices/costs that are excessively high or low (without sufficient justification) may be considered unreasonable
and the subject offeror may be excluded from further consideration.    The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal that includes
any assumption or condition that impacts or adversely affects the Government’s requirement.  Part I Tab D shall be evaluated to access whether
or not actual or potential an Organizational Conflict of Interest exists.  If a Conflict of Interest is found to exist that cannot be mitigated,
avoided, or waived in accordance with FAR 9.5, that offer shall be ineligible for award.

In determining the total price/cost reasonableness, the Government will consider the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform
the contract requirements.  The evaluation shall consider if the price/cost proposal correlates to the Project Approach and Management Plan
(Part II Tabs A and B) The evaluation shall also consider if the information allows for a positive assessment that the proposal price/cost is
sufficient to accomplish the PWS and that the offeror understands the requirement.

The price/cost proposal shall not be point scored, but shall be evaluated in determining best value (trade-off) to the Government.

Firm fixed price work will be managed to either the firm fixed price or other target price.

11. OPTIONS

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate quotes
for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not
obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Offerors should propose the base year and all option years. All years shall include the budget estimate for the Special Projects section 4.8 of
the PWS in order to reflect the possible contract ceiling costs for each option period as well as the over all contract ceiling.
