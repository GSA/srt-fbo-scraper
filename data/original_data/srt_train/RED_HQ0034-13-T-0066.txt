(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in

CONTRACTING OFFICER’S REPRESENTATIVE (COR)  (MARCH 2007)

The COR is a representative for the Government with limited authority who has been designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to provide
technical direction, clarification, and guidance with respect to existing specifications and statement of work (SOW)/statement of objectives
(SOO) as established in the contract.  The COR also monitors the progress and quality of the Contractor’s performance for payment purposes.  The
COR shall promptly report Contractor performance discrepancies and suggested corrective actions to the Contracting Officer for resolution.

The COR is NOT authorized to take any direct or indirect actions or make any commitments that will result in changes to price, quantity,
quality, schedule, place of performance, delivery or any other terms or conditions of the written contract.

The Contractor is responsible for promptly providing written notification to the Contracting Officer if it believes the COR has requested or
directed any change to the existing contract (or task/delivery order).  No action shall be taken by the Contractor for any proposed change to
the contract until the Contracting Officer has issued a written directive or written modification to the contract (or task/delivery order). The
Government will not accept and is not liable for any alleged change to the contract unless the change is included in a written contract
modification or directive signed by the Contracting Officer.

If the Contracting Officer has designated an Alternate COR (ACOR), the ACOR may act only in the absence of the COR (due to such reasons as
leave, official travel, or other reasons for which the COR is expected to be gone and not readily accessible for the day).

COR authority IS NOT delegable.

                                                                       for

                                                   Television and Radio Monitoring Subscription


1.0 SCOPE:  This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes requirements for providing an online service for viewing/hearing/sending television
and radio broadcasts searchable by keyword, phrase, date, or topic.  This may be thought of as a sophisticated “search and delivery” tool
similar in concept to a search engine for text.

2.0 Background and Mission:  The Public Affairs Research and Analysis (PARA) team in the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for
Public Affairs (OSD(PA)) is charged with providing the Secretary and Department of Defense public affairs officials with reports that may be
used either to provide context about, or to make decisions on, topics covered by various forms of media.  This research and analysis is derived
primarily from publicly available sources, such as, but not limited to, print newspapers, television, radio, online news sources, blogs,
Twitter, YouTube, and public opinion polls.  The team operates 24 hours daily Monday through Friday, plus eight hour shifts on Saturdays and
Sundays, and potentially  covers additional hours and holidays as deemed necessary by senior Public Affairs officials or breaking news events.

The PARA team operates under a mandate to provide a variety of products that will give senior leaders in the OSD (PA) and DoD (including the
Secretary of Defense):  1) greater awareness of developing trends in the media's coverage of DoD related events and policies; 2) alerts to
breaking news or news that is growing from small localized coverage or blogs into national and international media coverage; 3) analysis of how
the coverage reflects or fails to reflect the DoD's stated policies or views (as expressed by its spokespeople and other representatives); 4)
historical perspective on how media coverage of issues has evolved over time; 5) compilations of data (e.g., how many news reports on given
topics within a certain time period); and 6) locating specific news articles or broadcasts (whether television, radio, podcast, etc.) and
providing copies thereof.  The products may range in length from short email messages to multi-page reports.  Some of these products may have
the benefit of advance notice and planning while others may be requested on very short notice and with tight deadlines.  They will often be
initiated by the media analysts based on experience on what may be required.

A second component in OSD(PA), the Current News Service (CNS), which produces the daily news compilation known in the Pentagon as the “Early
Bird”, will use the television and radio monitoring service on occasion as well, but will not be the primary user.

3.0 Requirements:

3.1 - The contractor will provide an online platform available on a 365-day, 24-hour basis for direct access by team members, with maintenance
limited to overnight hours (after midnight), preferably on weekends so as not to disrupt access, except in emergencies.  Notice of maintenance
and upgrades will be provided to a point of contact at least 24 hours in advance except in emergencies.  The online platform will be fully
compatible with Internet Explorer 8.  In the event of browser upgrades, the government will provide the contractor with advance notice so that
the contractor’s service may continue.

3.2 – The online platform will include drop down menus to allow searches by keywords, combined with the ability to search on either individual
television/radio stations or a range of stations (e.g., all cable television broadcasters or all television stations in a given city), and the
ability to define the date and time of the search down to the minute.

3.3 – Broadcast segments should be available for searching within 10 minutes after air time.

3.4 – The following provides an example of what is required in search results for a specific clip, such as a CNN segment by one of its Pentagon
correspondents:  If the search was for “Chuck  Hagel” and it turned up five results for that day, all five would show a small image from each
clip and a portion of the transcript immediately before and after the search term.  Furthermore, after selecting one of the search results, a
user mustbe able to save either a portion of that clip or to save more than the clip shows, and to have the capability to “pause” the clip, to
maneuver playing the clip quickly backward and forward and for the user to edit the clip, to the second, for exactly what is required.  The user
should be able to view all this onscreen.  The clip should then be available for immediate saving or email delivery to the team member
performing the searching/editing.  In this example, the clip would then also be available for embedding into a report and transmitting to an
audience/readership of some 150 public affairs officers worldwide with no additional “click through” charges.  There should also be
functionality to obtain a full transcript of the clip as well as the audio/video portion.

3.5 – The software for the online platform should also allow each license holder within the contract to develop a series of “alert” terms that
will generate an email with the relevant clip to the license holder (much like CNN, Wall Street Journal, or other email alerts).

3.6 – The software shall include graphing and charting capabilities that would, for example, allow one to quickly see how often a predetermined
search term had been broadcast on selected media outlets over the past day, week, or month.

3.7 - Content shall be available for searching for at least 30 days after broadcast.

3.8 – Coverage requirements include all major television and cable news outlets (including but not necessarily limited to Bloomberg TV, CNBC,
