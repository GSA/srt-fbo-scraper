This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for
Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement
constitutes the only solicitation; Firm Fixed-Priced quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The
solicitation number is NAMA-11-Q-0018 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and
clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48 effective December 30, 2010.  This is an unrestricted acquisition,
issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
intends to issue a purchase order(s) with firm fixed-priced contract line items (CLINs).  EVALUATION: The Government reserves the right to issue
multiple purchase orders, as well as, award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement.  Evaluation and award will be in
accordance with the procedures of FAR 13.5 in conjunction with Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award
and Documentation and in accordance with the guidance at FAR 12.301(c)(2).  A purchase order will be issued to the Contractor(s) whose
conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this procurement will be obtained
through a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation.  For evaluation purposes, the firm-fixed price for each CLIN will be determined by
multiplying the Unit Price by the Quantity of units, and the Total fixed price will be determined by summing the firm-fixed price of all CLINs.
Contractors must provide pricing for each CLIN, including any Option CLINs.  The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-shelf items.
Section 508 Evaluation Factors- Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for receipt of the purchase order(s) after it has been
determined that the quotation adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508.  Only quotations which contain adequate information to
document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT)[1],
VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.  In order to facilitate a
comprehensive Government evaluation, contractors quoting “Or Equal” products are required to submit itemized technical specifications for CLIN
0001.  Additionally, contractors quoting “Or Equal” products are required to provide with their quote: 1) Documentation demonstrating the
compatibility of the quoted “Or Equal” product(s) with NARA’s network software as required by the Salient Characteristics.  At a minimum this
documentation must include: the date completed; name, position, and contact information of the person(s) conducting the verification; and
methodology of configuring the “Or Equal” product to function with NARA’s network; and 2) Documentation demonstrating that the quoted “Or Equal”
product’s capability to comply with the label printing requirement as required by the Salient Characteristics; this documentation must include:
the date completed; name, position, and contact information of the person(s) conducting the testing; and results of the testing.  The Government
may contact the person to verify the performance results.  This requirement is of utmost importance considering the potentially devastating
production issues that would result from latently non-compatible items.  BACKGROUND: The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase Black and
White Network Duplex Multifunction Printers (MFP) for the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC)’s Annex Facility located in Valmeyer, IL, as
well as, its new office and storage facility currently under construction in St. Louis, MO.  REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination pricing is
requested for each CLIN, all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed price.  See Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  Contractors must
submit their pricing in accordance with RFQ Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  See Attachment 3, Salient Characteristics for specifications.
DELIVERY: Packaging must be in a manner that prevents damage to the equipment during shipment.  Delivery must be undertaken during regular
business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the Contractor.  Duration of Performance: NARA may exercise the
option CLINs with the successful contractor (s) from the Date of Order through May 31, 2011.  AFFIRMATION STATEMENTS: Contractors must confirm
in their quote that all products quoted meet the Energy Star® energy use requirements.  All items quoted must be IPv6 compliant.  Section 508
Program Need - Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be
relevant for the following program need: "Multifunction Machines."  Section 508 Deliverable Requirements - Technical standards from 36 CFR part
1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and
Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in Attachment 2, Government
Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).  Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to
this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at
least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in Attachment 2.  Information, documentation, and support requirements from
36 CFR part 1194 Subpart D have been determined to apply to this acquisition.  Solicitation respondents must describe how the information,
documentation, and support proposed for Multifunction Machine deliverables meet at least those information, documentation, and support

RFQ Attachment 1, Required Quote Information.  It is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that NARA is not provided either counterfeit or
grey market products.  In the event that such IT products are determined to be counterfeit or grey market, NARA will seek all available legal
remedies including criminal prosecution.  Counterfeit information technology product means any item of information technology (IT), including
hardware and software that is an unauthorized copy, replica, or substitute.  A grey market or gray market also known as parallel market is the
trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original
manufacturer[2].  As a result manufacturers will not honor associated warranties and service agreements.  Unless you, the Vendor, are authorized
by the manufacturer to resell the particular items you are quoting in the USA, it is in your best interest as well as the Government’s that you
simply do not respond.  NARA will verify with the manufacturers immediately upon order issuance that the Contractor is an authorized reseller
for this buy.  Any issues with the information provided by the manufacturer to the Government about the grey market status of the items must be
addressed by the Contractor to the manufacturer.  The Government will immediately cancel any order based on a quotation of grey market items.
In an effort to further ensure NARA is receiving new, manufacturer approved OEM items and will receive the benefits of any warranties or other
manufacturer guarantees, NARA requires contractors to submit with their quote proof in writing from the OEM manufacturer of their status as an
authorized/certified OEM Contractor of the manufactured items.  Contractors must complete and return Attachment 1, Required Quote Information,
and Attachment 2, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT), in order for their quotations to be considered.  QUESTIONS:
Questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted in writing to Ms. Evelyn Carter no later than 4:00 PM ET on January 12, 2011 to be considered.
Questions submitted in any other manner will not be answered.  The Government will answer questions or requests for clarification via a written
RFQ amendment.  SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS:  Three (3) copies of each quotation should be mailed to National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA), Attention: Ms. Evelyn Carter (NAMA-11-Q-0018), 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 3340, College Park, MD 20740-6001 or e-mailed to:
evelyn.carter@nara.gov.  Quotations should be received by 4:00 PM ET on January 21, 2011.  Failure to submit quotations by the due date may
result in rejection of the quotation as untimely Contractors submitting via e-mail are cautioned to allow one extra business day for delivery
and confirm receipt of quotation as the e-mail will need to pass through IT security.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
clauses are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price contract, with the exception of FAR provisions which will
be removed prior to issuance of the order: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror

|The GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as |
|a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable    |
|Section 508 requirements. The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical        |

|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified |
|by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for  |
|this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT        |
|accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.                         |

Summary

 • Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each Section of
   the Standard is shown in parentheses.
 • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be features of
   the Contractor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the Contractor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable includes
   additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.
 • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
   deliverable.
 • Column four is a summary of the Contractor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
   Standard.
 • Column five is where the Contractor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
   applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.



    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the Contractor
      in providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the Contractor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the Contractor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is
      also an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.
