    2.     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a single contract for all items or multiple contracts if one Offeror cannot provide quotes for all items.  Award
will be made to the Offeror whose quote has the Lowest Price that is determined to be Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  The offered price quote
shall be deemed to be the lowest price that is technically acceptable if the items meet the technical specifications set forth in the SOW (see
Attachment 1, Section 4.12.2); and that meets Section 508 compliance requirements (see Attachment 2).

(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement.  The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of
options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished, to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice
of withdrawal is received before award.

Addendum to Provision:

(d) If the subject solicitation has been issued as a Request for Quotation, all references to offer and offeror are hereby changed to quote and
vendor respectively, except for in paragraph (c), which stands as written.    If a quote is provided, the Government may make an offer based on
all or part of a vendor’s quote, as originally presented or as subsequently modified.

(e) If any component of the contractor’s quote is not acceptable to the Government, then the Government may reject the quote without further
evaluation.

Addendum to Provision:

|This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with     |
|Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as |
|a part of their quote to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements.                                      |
|                                                                                                                                                      |
|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based |
|on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a    |
|"maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column.    |
|However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility       |
|requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility        |
|information.                                                                                                                                          |

|The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six|
|technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access    |
|Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor   |
|hours, respectively.                                                                                                                                  |

SUBCONTRACTING PLAN INSTRUCTIONS
(Only for Offers that require a Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR)


                                              INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSING AN INITIAL COMMERCIAL ITEM

                                                               SUBCONTRACTING PLAN
                                                         (modified for use on 20 Jun 07)


TYPE OF PLAN -- Any large business that does not have an approved small business subcontracting plan must submit a proposed plan to the
Contracting Officer.  This plan, when submitted, is a proposed Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  It is the preferred type of
subcontracting plan for this procurement, though the offerr/offeror may use a noncommercial plan instead.  Commercial plans are good for the
contractor's fiscal year, and do not have to be renegotiated for each contract requiring a plan.  Noncommercial plans are good for the life of
the contract involved, but must be renegotiated for each contract requiring a plan.

PLAN SUBMITTAL -- An offeror submitting a proposed commercial plan must submit it to the first Contracting Officer awarding a contract subject
to the plan during the Contractor's fiscal year.  This proposed plan must be submitted as part of the offer.  If that Contracting Officer is a
DoDEA Contracting Officer, the plan must have at least the information shown on the following pages.  Offerors submitting plans to DoDEA are
requested to use the format shown on the following pages in their submittal.  Plans already approved must be included in the offer.  An approved
commercial plan is generally valid for one year from the date of acceptance of the contract and is applicable to all other Government contracts.


IDENTITY OF THE SUBCONTRACTING PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR -- Before a plan is approved, the offeror is requested to provide the name of the
individual employed by the offeror who will administer the contractor’s subcontracting program.   This identity information should include the
name, title, address and telephone number (as well as e-mail address, if known) of the subcontracting program administrator.

PLAN START AND END DATES -- The proposed plan must specify the first and last dates when this plan will apply.  If the format on the following
pages is used, this is the "Period Covered By Plan."  The Contracting Officer will specify the starting date.  The offeror must specify the
ending date.  The ending date must be the last day of the offeror's current fiscal year.  If that ending date is fewer than 30 federal
government working days from the starting date, the offeror must either (a) fill in the ending date with the last date of the Contractor's next
fiscal year, or (b) complete the Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Renegotiation/Renewal) in addition to the plan.  (Using the
ending date of the offeror's next fiscal year is usually much simpler.)  Ensuing plans will coincide with the contractor's fiscal year.

REASONABLE GOALS -- The offeror must select goals that are reasonable based on making good faith efforts (to be described in this plan) to use
small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, service disabled veteran owned small business, and women-owned small business subcontractors to the
maximum extent practicable.  Contracting Officers will reject plans with unreasonably low goals, or efforts described herein that are not good
faith efforts.

QUESTIONS -- Should offerors have any questions regarding subcontracting plans, they should contact the DoDEA Small Business Specialist for this
solicitation/contract.
