19.  INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR WORK ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION

If this Order entails effort on a Government installation, including any off-site buildings owned or leased by the Government,  the  Seller  must
provide and maintain the minimum amounts of insurance stated below.

At Buyer’s request, Seller agrees to provide Certificates of Insurance evidencing  that  the  required  insurance  coverages  are  in  force  and
providing not less than thirty days written notice prior to any cancellation or restrictive modification of the policies.

Further, the required insurance coverages below shall be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other insurance that may be  maintained
by Buyer.  The below required coverages and their limits in no way lessen nor affect Seller’s other obligations or liabilities set forth in  this
Order.

Seller agrees to purchase and maintain at its own expense the following insurance coverages with minimum limits as stated:

   i) Statutory Workers’ Compensation and Employer’s Liability in an amount no less than  $1  Million  per  occurrence  covering  its  employees,
      including a waiver of subrogation obtained from the carrier in favor of Buyer;

  ii) Commercial General Liability in an amount no less than $1 Million per each occurrence and $2 Million  in  this  Aggregate  covering  bodily
      injury, broad form property damage, personal injury, products and completed operations, contractual liability and independent  contractors’
      liability.  Buyer, its officers and employees shall be included as Additional Insureds and a waiver of subrogation shall be  obtained  from
      the carrier in favor of Buyer;

 iii) Automobile Liability in an amount no less than $1 Million Combined Single Limit for Bodily Injury covering use of all owned, non-owned, and
      hired vehicles.  Buyer, its officers and employees shall be included as Additional Insureds on the policy;

  iv) Professional Liability in an amount no less than $1 Million per occurrence covering damages caused  by  any  acts,  errors,  and  omissions
      arising out of the professional services performed by Seller, or any person for whom the Seller is legally  liable.   To  the  extent  that
      coverage for Seller’s services are not excluded in (ii) above by virtue of being deemed not of a professional nature, this requirement does
      not apply.

   v) All-Risk Property Insurance in an amount adequate to replace property, including supplies covered by this Order, of  Buyer  and/or  Buyer’s
      customer that may be in the possession or control of Seller.  Buyer shall be named as a Loss Payee with respect to loss or damage  to  said
      property and/or supplies furnished by Buyer.

The required insurance coverages above shall be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other insurance that may be maintained by  Buyer
and notwithstanding any provision contained  herein,  Seller,  and  its  employees,  agents,  representatives,  consultants,  subcontractors  and
suppliers, are not insured by the Buyer, and are not covered under any policy of insurance that the Buyer has obtained or has in place.

Any self-insured retentions, deductibles and exclusions in coverage in the policies required under this Article shall  be  assumed  by,  for  the
account of, and at the sole risk of Seller which provides the insurance and to the extent applicable shall be paid by Seller.  In no event  shall
the liability of Seller be limited to the extent of any insurance or the minimum limits required herein.

20.   EXPORT CONTROL COMPLIANCE FOR FOREIGN PERSONS

Seller shall not, nor shall Seller authorize or permit its employees,  agents  or  lower  tiers  to  disclose,  export  or  re-export  any  Buyer

Treasury or Commerce proscribed persons or destinations lists, or if Seller’s export privileges are otherwise denied,  suspended  or  revoked  in
whole or in part.

Seller shall have the right to assign this Order to any successor of such party  by  way  of  merger  or  consolidation  or  the  acquisition  of

that such successor shall expressly assume all of the obligations and liabilities of the Seller under this  Order,  and  that  the  Seller  shall
remain liable and responsible to Buyer for the performance and observance of all such obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts due the Seller may be assigned in accordance with the provisions of the clause  52.232-23,  Assignment

22.    DISPUTES

(A) If a decision relating to the Prime Contract is made by the NCI-Frederick Contracting Officer and such  decision  is  also  related  to  this
Order, said decision, if binding upon Buyer under the Prime Contract shall in turn be binding upon Buyer and Seller with respect to such  matter;
provided, however, that if Seller disagrees with any such decision made by the NCI Contracting Officer and Buyer elects not to  appeal  any  such
decision, Seller shall have the right reserved to Buyer under the Prime Contract with the Government to prosecute a timely appeal in the name  of
Buyer, as permitted by the contract or by law, Seller to bear its own legal and other costs.  If Buyer elects not to appeal  any  such  decision,
Buyer agrees to notify Seller in a timely fashion after receipt of such decision and to assist Seller in its prosecution of any  such  appeal  in
every reasonable manner.  If Buyer elects to appeal any such decision of the NCI Contracting Officer, Buyer agrees to furnish Seller promptly  of
a copy of such appeal. Any decision upon appeal, if binding upon Buyer, shall in turn  be  binding  upon  Seller.   Pending  the  making  of  any
decision, either by the NCI Contracting Officer or on appeal, Seller shall proceed diligently with performance of this Order. 
 
If, as a result of any decision or judgment whish is binding upon Seller and Buyer, as provided above, Buyer  is  unable  to  obtain  payment  or
reimbursement from the Government under the Prime Contract for, or is required to refund or credit to the Government, any amount with respect  to
any item or matter for which the Buyer has  reimbursed  or  paid  Seller,  Seller  shall,  on  demand,  promptly  repay  such  amount  to  Buyer.
Additionally, pending the final conclusion of any appeal hereunder, Seller shall, on demand promptly repay any such  amount  to  Buyer.   Buyer's
maximum liability for any matter connected with or related to this Order which was properly the subject of a claim against the  Government  under
the Prime Contract shall not exceed the amount of the Buyer's recovery from the Government.
 
Seller agrees to provide certification that data supporting any claim made by Seller hereunder is made in good  faith  and  that  the  supporting
data is accurate and complete to the best of the Seller's knowledge or belief, all in accordance with the requirements of the Contracts  Disputes
Act of 1978 (41USC601-613) and implementing regulations. If any claim of Seller is determined to be based on  upon  fraud  or  misrepresentation,
Seller agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Buyer harmless for any and all liability, loss, cost, or expense resulting there from.
 
Any dispute not addressed in paragraph (A) above, will be subject to paragraph (B) as described below.

(B) Buyer and Seller agree to first enter into negotiations to resolve any controversy, claim or dispute (“dispute”) arising  under  or  relating
to this Order.  The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of such dispute within a reasonable  period
of time.  If good faith negotiations are unsuccessful, Buyer and Seller agree to  resolve  the  dispute  by  binding  and  final  arbitration  in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  The arbitration  shall  take  place  in
the County of Frederick, State of Maryland.  The arbitrator(s) shall be bound to follow the provisions of this Order in  resolving  the  dispute,
and may not award punitive damages.  The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be  final  and  binding  on  the  parties,  and  any  award  of  the
arbitrator(s) may be entered or enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Seller hereby waives any immunity, sovereign or otherwise, that it would otherwise  have  to  such  jurisdiction  and  agrees  that  its  rights,
obligations, and liabilities hereunder shall be determined in the same manner and to the same extent as those of a private  litigant  under  like
circumstances.

All costs of the arbitration shall be shared equally between the Parties, but the Parties specifically agree  that  each  Party  shall  bear  the
expense of any costs incurred by it for its own counsel, experts, witnesses, preparation of documents, presentations, and  logistics  related  to
the proceedings.

Pending any decision, appeal or judgment referred to in this provision or the settlement of any dispute arising under this  Order,  Seller  shall
proceed diligently with the performance of this Order.

23.   NOTIFICATION OF DEBARMENT/SUSPENSION

require Seller to promptly correct, repair, replace or re-perform the goods or services.  The cost of correction,  repair,  replacement,  or  re-

then Buyer may procure such materials and services from another source or perform such services in-house  and  charge  to  Seller’s  account  all
costs, expenses and damages associated therewith.  Buyer’s approval of designs furnished by Seller shall not relieve Seller  of  its  obligations
hereunder.
