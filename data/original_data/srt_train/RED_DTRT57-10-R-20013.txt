Background

NextGen is a widely distributed system-of-systems (SoS).  It is composed of multiple systems, including, but not limited to, communications and
data-sharing, location determining, and flight planning to approach surveillance systems.  NextGen is also a critical component of a broader
aviation enterprise, including airport authorities, airlines, general aviation, and other federal agencies.[1]  This complexity extends to the
enterprise itself through “the diversity of stakeholders associated with NextGen.  Stakeholder groups will likely differ in viewpoint, which
will be reflected in the needs and requirements. This diversity must be effectively managed, most likely through a governance process, in order
for NextGen to be successful”.[2]

Federal Aviation Administration, NextGen Integration & Implementation Office, Chief Systems Engineers Group (AJP-A2) has tasked the Volpe Center
to provide resources and capabilities to develop, deploy, and implement a NextGen opportunity/risk management process for the NextGen
Integration and Implementation (NextGen I&I) Office.  The Volpe Center will provide expertise in the Risk Management mitigation and remediation
field, by participation in the NextGen expert panels and committees that will define the risks, opportunities and action plans associated with
these.

To support this effort, Volpe Center will procure a commercially available enterprise opportunity/risk management software tool based on
requirements provided by NextGen I&I.  In addition the Volpe Center will provide resources with opportunity/risk management expertise to assist
NextGen I&I with implementing the new capability.


Scope

The following elements and considerations are necessary for successful management of Opportunity/Risk in the NextGen context:

      • Strategy – Statement of purpose and approach to managing opportunity/risk in the context of NextGen.
      • Plan – Documentation to establish the operating scope, process, tools, documentation, and roles/responsibilities/authority (RAA).
      • Process Framework – Overall process structure to systematically and consistently identify, analyze, and manage NextGen
        opportunities/risks.
      • Integration – Interaction with other key NextGen management systems/processes such as Performance Management and Management Visibility
        systems.
      • Governance – The policies and mechanisms to render decisions regarding NextGen level opportunities/risks are addressed at the NextGen
        enterprise level.
      • Products & Tools – A suite of products and tools is necessary to enable effective analysis and management of NextGen
        opportunities/risks.  This includes software, data repository, and outputs to support the governance process.
      • Training – Role based training is required for participants and interested parties spanning decision makers, practitioners, and affected
        stakeholders.
      • Deployment - The roll–out of a consistent NextGen risk management process will be staged to ensure that the participating organizations
        and functions achieve an appropriate level of maturity to allow them to improve their overall performance.


Objectives

Risk management is often viewed as an impediment to achieving an organization’s goals.  Striking the proper balance between risk and performance
turns risk management into a proactive decision tool, especially when coupled with pursuit of potential opportunities.  Investment in this
capability directly supports the goals of effective communication across the NextGen community in the support of major
operational/organizational decisions e.g. future strategic direction, program approval, or capital investment approval.


Specifications

A NextGen Enterprise Risk Management plan shall be developed and maintained by the NextGen Integration & Implementation (NII) organization.
Risk information shall be integrated into a NextGen information portal via the approved NextGen tool suite (currently Primavera).  Baseline
deployment will address a core capability to support the NextGen office, with expansion beyond the NextGen office.

A central NextGen enterprise risk database shall be established and maintained by the NextGen risk executive function within the NII office.
The database will reflect all active NextGen risks that are the responsibility of the FAA to include description, impacts, current status,
history, decisions (including rationale) actions taken, and organizational responsibilities assigned.

A historical archive of all risks considered during the life of the NextGen enterprise shall be maintained.  The single authoritative source for
all FAA NextGen enterprise risk information shall be the NextGen Enterprise Risk Database.

Other support needed:

The Contractor must support the Volpe Center and the Chief Systems Engineer (CSE) to use the risk management tool suite in the performance of
opportunity/risk management for future NAS Services and Systems and the analysis and definition of mitigations that are needed to address
opportunities/risks in the mid term and far term leading to NextGen.  This support must take the form of:

      ❖ Project Framework Definition
        First meeting between NextGen Opportunity/Risk team & vendor to discuss and define project scope, requirements, roles and
        responsibilities, communication plan, budget and schedule, deliverables and quality control measures.


      ❖ Onsite Installation Workshop and Support
        Installation and testing of the tool, completed installation checklist and installation report


      ❖ Database setup and process review
        Review of existing client Risk Management Process, risk registries, and risk procedures.


      ❖ System tailoring and configuration reviews
        Aligning and configuring the tool in support of a Client proposed usage.  Includes the Development of System Configuration Report

Training and Documentation


Training

A comprehensive training program shall be established to provide role based training.  The training shall be organized into four (4) role based
packages, which addresses each specific role, scope of management, and authority.

This shall be a one-time training, and each role shall be trained separately.  Thereafter any new user will be trained by internal staff
(Volpe/FAA).

Each training package shall be quoted separately and per role.  The number of training packages or levels needed will be determined during
implementation.


Documentation

The vendor shall provide user guides and manuals that indentify how to operate the software, and documentation such as the following (but not
limited to):

    ➢ Interfaces with DOORS and PRIMAVERA: fields, protocol(s), maintenance, etc.
    ➢ Software maintenance activities
    ➢ Data entry/upload procedures
    ➢ Data files and dependencies
    ➢ Database schema and data dictionary
    ➢ Indexes creation and maintenance


Licenses

The vendor shall provide a quote for up to 6 user licenses, and at the following levels:

|Qty      |User type/role           |
|1        |Level 1                  |
|2        |Level 2                  |
|2        |Level 3                  |
|1        |Level 4                  |

The Government will purchase between one (1) and six (6) user licenses.  The need of any additional license will be assessed and determined at
any point during first 12 months of the implementation stage.

For a detailed description of each user type/role see Table 1.

Period of Performance

The deployment of NextGen enterprise risk management will be staged over a 24 to 36 months period to ensure that the participating organizations
and functions achieve an appropriate level of maturity to allow them to improve their overall performance.

The vendor shall install the software and assist during the first 12 months of the roll-out period.  Vendor assistance should include:
      ❖ Support
         ➢ Maintenance
         ➢ Troubleshooting
      ❖ Software updates/upgrades


The period of performance will be one year from the award, with optional one year extension.  No additional support is foreseen from the vendor
past the second year.
