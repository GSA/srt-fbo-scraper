The offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement. The following definitions are provided for your information: Hard Metric - The replacement of a standard inch/pound size with an accepted metric size when necessitated for a particular purpose.

d)

If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract1. Communications will be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range. 2.

Oral or written discussions will be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. While it is the Government's policy to conduct discussions with all offerors in the competitive range, the Government reserves the right, in special circumstances, to limit the number of proposals included in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition.

The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP.

Project Officer:

Base Performance Period: Option Period 1: Option Period 2: Option Period 3: Option Period 4:

Background The Clinical Center is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Clinical Center provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs. The Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is responsible for processes and systems that directly affect users in the care delivery and research settings. Work focuses on the analysis and evaluation of clinical research informatics needs and requirements, the development of design options that support the work processes of clinical research, and the implementation and management of responsive IT solutions. Within the NIH Clinical Center there are over 100 IT Systems with approximately 70 systems with Patient Identifiable Information. These systems include Clinical, Administrative and Business Systems. Sixty percent of the systems are commercial off the shelf with 40% custom developed. However, many of the commercial off the shelf systems contain custom developed modules and/or interfaces developed by NIH CC DCRI staff. Purpose The purpose of this contract is to engage the services of an IT System Architect to assist in the development of a strategic plan for the management of the development life-cycle of modules and systems developed within NIH CC DCRI, and the development and management of a set of applications that will connect programs and databases of multiple systems to improve the use of the Clinical Research Information System and the management of data within the NIH Clinical Center. The support and enhancements of any system once it is operational is critical to its success. The support includes the development of the documentation as well as the knowledge transfer required to allow Government employees to assume the design, development, and support roles.

Scope of Work The contractor shall assist the CC CIO, CC DCRI Technical Architect, CC ISSO and CC DCRI Application Development Supervisor with the development of a strategic plan for the management of the development process for NIH Clinical Center IT Clinical Systems. This assistance includes the analysis and review of the existing business practices being followed for the management of all development of NIH CC IT Systems and components to NIH CC IT Systems, development of components for the Security Certification and Accreditation documentation, development of a formal plan for contingency and disaster recovery for all the clinical systems, and the development of a 1 year, 2 year and 5 plan for support and implementation of NIH CC Clinical Systems. The development of the plan for the management of applications that will connect multiple systems to improve the use of the Clinical Research Information System and the management of data within the NIH Clinical Center will include existing and newly developed systems. The tasks include aiding in the definition and gathering of user requirements, evaluation of existing systems, analysis of existing systems with the DCRI IT Strategic Plan, development of detailed system documentation, assistance in the development of work and project documentation, development of new and existing applications, the testing of applications, development of a Rev 01-28-2011

Attachment No 1 ­ Statement of Work NIHCL2011085 performance management plan for each application, the implementation of applications, and the training and transfer of knowledge to others to support these applications. The support of the applications in the table listed below will continue to be maintained by the IT System Architect until knowledge transfer has been completed. Once knowledge transfer has been completed the IT System Architect will assume an advisory role. These planned systems to improve the use and management of data within the NIH Clinical Center will interface with the existing, such as; CRIS/Allscripts SCM; QDX and eLink Interface Engines, CC Ancillary Systems such as Carestream RIS, SCC LIS, 3M/SoftMed MRD Modules; and NIH Sybase Databases including Patient and Protocol databases. The tasks and systems that this contract will address include but are not limited those listed below.

The Surgical Information System does not Visual Basic 6 receive key information for the hospital MS ADODB population. When surgery is scheduled, MS SQL Server lab results for the last 30 days and allergy TCP/IP information are assembled and sent to SIS Oracle through the SISbot. This process may need to be modified during the upgrade to version 5.x Several departments have data in MS MS Access Access that needs to be moved to more MS SQL Server secure storage, and have enhanced security applied to user interfaces. 20 such applications were secured for Transfusion Medicine; support of these and extension to other departments will be needed. This application provides a framework for Visual Basic 6 tasks that use a database query to detect MS ADODB conditions requiring messages to be sent MS SQL Server to reconcile elements of CRIS and its TCP/IP ancillaries. Tasks include: QDX Cloverleaf 1. Background order transfer for Sybase Pain & Palliative Care; Sunrise Clinical 2. Isolation Header updates; Manager 5.0 3. Allergy cancellation messages to RIS; 4.

Conversion and rescaling of TIF EKG images to GIF for display in a custom CRIS tab; and 5. Validation of signature and registration in CRIS of physicians' reports in PDF format. The Social Security Death Index is MS Access provided in a fixed text format. Conversion of this information and its use to identify expired patients will assist with data cleanup efforts. Clinical events and metrics are tracked and Ruby on Rails stored in Sybase for display by the Aptana RadRails Executive Information System.

Column one involves consideration of all the Sections of the Standard that might apply to any deliverable. The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses. ˇ Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type. Some of these might not be features of the vendor's deliverable. Conversely, others not noted might be features of the vendor's deliverable. If the deliverable involves consideration of additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered. ˇ Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard. Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable. ˇ Column four is a summary of the vendor's response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard. ˇ Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.
