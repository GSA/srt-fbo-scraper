The Department of Commerce (DOC), NESDIS, Center for Satellite, Applications and Research (STAR) is requesting services that will support the software configuration management used for the GOES-R Algorithm Working Group (AWG) algorithm development tasks. The GOES-R AWG is developing the operational algorithms for GOES-R instruments.  This algorithm development requires integrating satellite data, model outputs and insitu data for algorithm tests and validation.  Currently, 57 algorithms are being developed by the AWG.  The development of these algorithms occurs on Linux and AIX machines and the creation of these algorithms requires software to be written in both C/C++ and Fortran 90.  This software is used to produce the 57 satellite data products. To manage the software used by AWG, the ClearCase Change Management Solution was purchased by STAR in 2007.  The tool controls the revision control and change management of the software for all of the AWG; approximately 500,000 lines of code.  It allows the AWG to check out the software by multiple developers and update it as required.  When it is checked back into the repository, changes are submitted into ClearQuest for record keeping.  The ClearCase tool allows the AWG to efficiently control the algorithm development for the GOES-R products.  The purchase of the licenses will allow the AWG to continue to use the ClearCase Change Management Solution for its software management. The services will be for a one year period.  This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and guidance of FAR 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only Solicitation that will be published; proposals are being requested and a written Solicitation will not be issued.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999) 

The above stated FAR Clause is applicable to this evaluation process.   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

-  Offeror’s technical approach, the offeror's approach to understanding the requirement and qualifications .
-  The quality of the offeror's recent and relevant past performance 
-  Price

Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all years to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the year prices are significantly unbalanced. 

The evaluation criteria above are listed in descending order of importance.  When combined, the technical approach and past performance are significantly more important than price.  As non-priced factors reach equality, price becomes a significant factor. The price shall include sufficient data to allow the Government to determine the amount, realism and consistency of the fixed price. The Government shall not be liable for any costs incurred in response to this request.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 



The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors except  for clarifications.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary.

 

Past Performance:  Offeror must ensure three (3) Past Performance References are submitted as described above.  Past Performance shall be received by the submission date of proposals. Past Performance references must be emailed as stated above.  Past performance assessments will be evaluated  in the areas of :



Quality of Work

Business Relations

Timeliness of Performance

Customer Satisfaction



EVALUATION APPROACH:  



The Government intends to use the offeror’s proposal as a means of evaluating the offeror’s ability to satisfy the requirement of this Purchase Order, in terms of the technical approach in conjunction with past performance, and pricing submission to determine the award of the Purchase Order.  The best value will represent the offeror that demonstrates the ability to provide the best proposal to the Order, considering the offerors’ understanding of the project and the offeror’s approach to satisfy the requirements, ability to satisfy the schedule and deliverable requirements, past performance as it relates to the Order and price.  Price will include the reasonableness of the price and locality adjustment factor(s).   The Government may award to other than the highest rated offeror when the price proposed by this offeror for the tasks is determined to be unaffordable.
