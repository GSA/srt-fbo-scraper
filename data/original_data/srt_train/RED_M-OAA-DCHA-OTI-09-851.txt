GENERAL INFORMATION

You may apply for most Federal jobs with a resume, the attached Optional Application for Federal Employment or other written format.  If your
resume or application does not provide all  the information requested on this form and in the job vacancy announcement, you may lose
consideration for a job.  Type or print clearly in dark ink.  Help speed the selection process by keeping your application brief and sending
only the requested information.  If essential to attach additional pages, include your name and Social Security Number on each page.

•     For information on Federal employment, including job lists, alternative formats for persons with disabilities, and veterans’ preference,
   call the U.S. Office of Personnel Management at 912-757-3000, TDD 912-744-2299, by computer modem 912-757-3100, or via the Internet (Telnet
   only) at FJOB.MAIL.OPM.GOV.

•     If you served on active duty in the United States Military and were separated under honorable conditions, you may be eligible for
   veterans’ preference.  To receive preference if your service began after October 15, 1976, you must have a Campaign Badge, Expeditionary
   Medal, or a service-connected disability.  Veterans’ preference is not a factor for Senior Executive Service jobs or when competition is
   limited to status candidates (current or former career or career-conditional Federal employees.)

•     Most Federal jobs require United States citizenship and also that males over age 18 born after December 31, 1959, have registered with the
   Selective Service System or have an exemption.

•     The law prohibits public officials from appointing, promoting, or recommending their relatives.

•     Federal annuitants (military and civilian) may have their salaries or annuities reduced.  All employees must pay any valid delinquent
   debts or the agency may garnish their salary.

•     Send your application to the office announcing the vacancy.  If you have questions, contact that office.

PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS

•     The Office of Personnel Management and other Federal agencies rate applicants for Federal jobs under the authority of sections 1104, 1302,
   3301, 3304, 3320, 3361, 3393, and 3394 of title 5 of the United States Code.  We need the information requested in this form and in the
   associated vacancy announcements to evaluate your qualifications.  Other laws require us to ask about citizenship, military service, etc.

•     We request your Social Security Number (SSN) under the authority of Executive Order 9397 in order to keep your records straight; other
   people may have the same name.  As allowed by law or Presidential directive, we use your SSN to seek information about you from employers,
   schools, banks, and others who know you.  Your SSN may also be used in studies and computer matching with other Government files, for example,
   files on unpaid student loans.

•     If you do not give us your SSN or any other information requested, we cannot process your application, which is the first step in getting
   a job.  Also, incomplete addresses and ZIP Codes will slow processing.

•     We may give information from your records to: training facilities; organizations deciding claims for retirement, insurance, unemployment
   or health benefits; officials in litigation or administrative proceedings where the Government is a party; law enforcement agencies concerning
   violations of law or regulation; Federal agencies for statistical reports and studies; officials of labor organizations recognized by law in
   connection with representing employees; Federal agencies or other sources requesting information for Federal agencies in connection with
   hiring or retaining, security clearances, security or suitability investigations, classifying jobs, contracting, or issuing licenses, grants,
   or other benefits; public and private organizations including news media that grant or publicize employee recognition and awards; and the
   Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of Special Counsel, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal Labor Relations
   Authority, the National Archives, the Federal Acquisition Institute, and congressional offices in connection with their official functions.

•     We may also give information from your records to: prospective nonfederal employers concerning tenure of employment, civil service status,
   length of service, and date and nature of action for separation as shown on personnel action forms of specifically identified individuals;
   requesting organizations or individuals concerning the home address and other relevant information on those who might have contracted an
   illness or been exposed to a health hazard; authorized Federal and nonfederal agencies for use in computer matching; spouses or dependent
   children asking whether the employee has changed from self-and-family to self-only health benefits enrollment; individuals working on a
   contract, service, grant, cooperative agreement or job for the Federal Government; non-agency members of an agency's performance or other
   panel; and agency- appointed representatives of employees concerning information issued to the employee about fitness-for-duty or agency-filed
   disability retirement procedures.

•     We estimate the public reporting burden for this collection will vary from 20 to 240 minutes with an average of 40 minutes per response,
   including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering data, and completing and reviewing the information.  You
   may send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of the collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this
   burden, to U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Reports and Forms Management Officer,  Washington, DC 20415-0001.

•     Send your application to the agency announcing the vacancy.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help  local  partners  advance  peace
and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast,  flexible,
short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from  civil  conflict  have  unique  needs  that
cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective  assistance  to  promote  and  consolidate  peaceful,  democratic
advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by  aiding  indigenous,  mostly  non-
governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as  support  for  re-integration  of  ex-combatants  into  civilian
society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of  quick-impact  community  self-help  projects  to  meet
urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden  public
participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts  under
personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work  force  and  are  at
its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.



For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

Introduction

OTI has become a recognized leader and authority among foreign assistance organizations in the field  of  communication  and  media  development.
OTI’s recent initiatives have included support of underdeveloped  media  infrastructure,  journalism,  and  regulatory  frameworks,  funding  and
directing critical transitional communications activities, and advancing the  capacity  of  host  government  communications  offices.  OTI  will
consider any engagement that will address a political transition need and conforms to USG  foreign  assistance  regulations.   In  an  effort  to
maintain and advance the Office’s stature in this arena, OTI employs a team of two dedicated media technical support positions: the Senior  Media
Specialist and the Senior Field Advisor – Media.  Working as a team, these two staff members support both the  Washington  DC  office  and  OTI’s
field programs dividing the work and responsibilities as necessary.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to hire a qualified professional able to provide a full range of services  to  OTI  media-related  projects
and programs.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Senior Media Specialist is responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with U.S. Government agencies working in  communication
and media, particularly in OTI countries; assessing the media needs of OTI programs; evaluating the media-related work of grantees;  articulating
OTI’s policy and position on media issues; ensuring that USG and OTI interests are protected and coordinated; and  implementing  policy  properly
and consistently.  The Advisor will also be responsible for reviewing and supporting the work of the OTI field offices worldwide with respect  to
media-related activities, and providing OTI/Washington with regular reports that include observations, problems, and recommendations. The  Senior
Media Specialist serves as a liaison for media development between USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) and  different  offices/bureaus
within USAID Washington, the State Department, USAID Field Missions, the U.S. Ambassador or her/his Representative (in the  absence  of  a  USAID
Mission), other parts of the U.S. Government, international organizations, and the non-governmental community in Washington and abroad.  In  this
context, the Senior Media Specialist will visit, as necessary, both ongoing OTI media projects as well as proposed and potential country  program
sites.

Duties and Responsibilities

Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division or his or her designee, and  in  coordination  and
collaboration with the OTI Senior Field Advisor – Media, the Washington-based Senior Media Specialist will perform the following duties:

In new and existing country programs, the Senior Media Specialist will:

    • Assess the efficacy and potential role of media and public communications activities in meeting OTI objectives in a country or program;

    • Conceptualize and design media and public communications components and strategies for  new country programs in  close  collaboration  with
      the relevant OTI/Washington Regional Team Leader, and assist in the development of stand-alone OTI media assistance strategies and policies
      for the country;

    • Provide ongoing technical support to OTI country programs in their development of media support programs and programs utilizing  media  and
      strategic communications tools.  Travel to current OTI programs to assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring and  evaluation  of
      media support and strategic communications programming. Where appropriate and relevant, work with country teams to better  integrate  media
      development and communications strategies and activities with their other OTI country program efforts;

    • Conduct, with in-country representatives, visits to field sites in areas where OTI has or may have media-related projects;

    • Under the guidance and supervision of an OTI/Washington Regional Team Leader or designated Country Representative, negotiate  media-related
      program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;

    • Monitor and review work plans, activities and performance and evaluate program outcomes of OTI contractors and  grantees  with  respect  to
      media related projects to ensure application of best practices, coordination of  media-related  programs  with  USAID  missions  and  other
      international organizations in support of OTI country programs and through the CTO;

    • In support of the OTI country programs provide onsite training and mentoring on media/communications for new OTI or contractor  staff  both
      in Washington and the field as required with coordination of the CTO;

    • Execute closeout activities related to OTI media programs and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI media programs  in
      the field;

    • Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance  to  OTI  programs  in  Washington  and
      overseas to develop and maintain professional relationships with them on media and communications programming and policy options;

Within OTI efforts aimed at strengthening the use of media as a stabilization and development tool, the Senior Media Specialist will:

    • Conceptualize OTI’s office-wide strategy on media programming, incorporating lessons learned from OTI experience  and  other  organizations
      working on media in transitions and development;

    • Develop and improve country program monitoring and evaluation systems with respect to media and communications program components;

    • Conceptualize and design, in close coordination with high-ranking USAID  and  other  U.S.  Government  officials,  specific  country  media
      activities including, where appropriate, USAID funding levels and requirements;

    • Act as a DCHA/OTI representative in high-level media venues related to  USAID  and  other  U.S.  Government  officials,  UN  organizations,
      international non-governmental organizations, other international donors and national leaders, civic activists and community members;

    • Serve as one of OTI’s Senior Leadership Team’s principal experts on media-related technical, program, and policy issues; and,

    • In close consultation with OTI’s Monitoring and Evaluation Program Manager, develop and manage the  OTI-Media  Program  Performance  Review
      process.

In order to identify opportunities for expansion of OTI’s involvement in media-related activities in support  of  overall  transition  goals  and
objectives, the Senior Media Specialist may be required to participate, for short periods of time, in program activities that  are  not  directly
and immediately media-related, to include:

      technical assistance; and

    • Implementing and managing a country program in the absence of the OTI Country Representative in the field, or serving as a team  leader  or
      program manager in Washington in coordination with the CTO, including assessing project sites and selecting contractor and grantees to work
      under OTI's country program.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and  the  supervisor  together  will  develop  deadlines,  projects,  and  work  to  be
accomplished.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

ATTACHMENT 1

Acquisition & Assistance Policy Directive (AAPD) No. 06-10
PSC Medical Expense Payment Responsibility

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006)

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply  to
this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain  health  insurance  that
covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or  provision  in  this  contract  that  pertains  to
insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance  is  the  primary  payer  for  medical  services
provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined  by
the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family  member  is  not  covered  by
health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and  the  U.S.  Government  has  no  payment
obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are  covered  by  health  insurance,
where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is  incurred,  caused,  or  materially  aggravated  while  the  eligible
individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required  or  requires  hospitalization  and  the  expense  is  directly
related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment  is  appropriate  for,  and
directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel  for  the  contractor  or  an  eligible  family
member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel  and  Transportation  Expenses  (July  1993),  section  (i)  entitled  “Emergency  and
Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit  consultation,  the  Mission  Director  may
issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that  the  FSMP  or  Post  Medical  Advisor  (PMA)  is
notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her  medevac  insurance  provider
and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The  contractor  must
repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel  to  be  an
allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written  evidence  that  medevac  insurance  does  not  cover  these
medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary  payer  for  the  total
amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance  of  Form  DS-3067,
Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents,  to  secure  admission  to  a  hospital  located  abroad  for  the  uninsured
contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in  full  for  funds  advanced  by  USAID
pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost  from  the  contractor’s
invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the  U.S.  Government,  or  through  any  other  available  debt
collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization  for  Medical  Services  for  Employees  and/or  Dependents),
repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for  the  amount  of  such  expenses  USAID  is
obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the  repayment  amount  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this
provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical  travel
costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor  or  an  eligible  family  member)  who  is  covered  by  insurance,  that
individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as  the  individual  receives  the
insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf  or  the  repayment  amount
determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered  by  insurance,  the
contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from  his/her  medevac
provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount  of  such  payments  to
USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond  the  control  of
the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must  settle  all  medical  expense  and  medical  travel  costs.   If  the
contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to  the  insurance
carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).
