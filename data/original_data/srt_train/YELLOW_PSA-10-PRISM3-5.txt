1. Introduction 1.1. Background The D.C. Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) is an independent entity within the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) in the Executive Branch of the Federal government. PSA has served the District of Columbia for more than 40 years and is widely recognized as a leader in the pretrial field. PSA's mission is to assess, supervise and provide services for defendants, and collaborate with the justice community, to assist the courts in making pretrial release decisions. The agency promotes community safety and return to court while honoring the constitutional presumption of innocence. PSA plays a vital role in the District of Columbia's criminal justice system. The Agencies vision is to thrive as a leader within the justice system by developing an empowered workforce that embodies integrity, excellence, accountability, and innovation in the delivery of the highest quality services. PSA gathers and presents information about newly arrested defendants and about available release options for use by judicial officers in deciding what, if any, conditions are to be set for released defendants (the diagnostic function). Additionally, PSA supervises defendants released from custody during the pretrial period by monitoring their compliance with conditions of release and by helping to ensure that they appear for scheduled court hearings. PSA supervision gives the defendants the opportunity to participate in a variety of pro-social interventions that decrease the likelihood of future criminal behavior (the supervision and treatment functions). The mission of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) is to support PSA's automation objectives in a reliable, timely, and cost-effective manner, providing access to the state-of-theart technology and assisting staff in achieving their mission and realizing their strategic goals. Our vision is to be an advisor and provide sound technical solutions to PSA management, PSA staff, the justice community, our clients, and the public. The Pretrial Real-time Information System Manager (PRISM) is the agency's enterprise client management system (CMS). PRISM's primary purpose is to provide reliable information that improves the timeliness and quality of recommendations and decisions associated with the supervision and treatment of defendants who enter the criminal justice system. It became operational March 3, 2002 and it is now in the maintenance phase where it continuously evolves. The current system's revision is version 2.5 and it was given a full authorization to operate (ATO) according to FISMA requirements on December, 2008. PRISM is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24x7) with less than 45 minutes a month of down time (99.9% reliability). The system uses proven and standard technology, the same technology as in the World Wide Web. The soon to be released 2.9 and 3.1 versions were built on the MicrosoftŽ .NET Framework tools, techniques, and technologies to deliver a feature rich, user friendly and secure CMS. Microsoft .NET is software for connecting people, information, systems, and devices. The system uses Windows 2003 Servers, MS SQL Server 2005, Internet Information Services (IIS), Active Server Pages, Visual Basic, and other tools.

The contractor shall take the requirements, analyze them, and document the design and workflow using MS Visio (Deliverable 16) and build working prototypes (Deliverable 17) of each module so they may be constructed. The contractor shall create, update, and maintain MS Visio diagrams of each object, component, or service designed and implemented. The diagrams shall accurately depict each one of the object's interfaces and their parameters, and how they were combined to create a component or a service. Furthermore, the contractor shall create, update, and maintain a Visio flow chart and workflow of each PRISM subsystem. The diagrams shall be properly labeled, categorized, and stored inside the source code library (Deliverable 16). In addition, the contractor shall document the database design in an entity relationship diagram - ERD (Deliverable 18) and a data dictionary ­ DD document (Deliverable 19) and a requirements and field traceability matrix document (Deliverable 15). Using the standards and guidelines set forth in the "PSA .NET Coding Standards & Best Practices" (Attachment 3) document and following the "PRISM Data Architecture Standards" (Attachment 5) for the database and relying on the.Net Core Enterprise Library (Attachment 4) the contractor shall deliver complete and tested software with source code for all modules. Each module shall be coded, cleaned and tested. The government intends to deploy the modules as they are completed. The software to be produced includes HTML, ASP.NET pages, VB.NET components, DDL/T-SQL scripts, and stored procedure scripts among others. All code delivered shall be subject to code review and possible modification to ensure that it conforms to the best practices and standards established previously.

personnel, the contractor shall perform testing of the developed components to ensure its functionality and operation. The test results shall be documented whether or not successful (Deliverable 6). Uncovered defects shall be addressed, corrected, and the component retested. If a test is not successful the contractor shall take immediate remediation actions and once the issues are solved the item shall be retested. The government will only accept complete, tested, and working according to specifications software (Deliverable 7). Working in conjunction with the Agency personnel, the contractor shall perform stress-testing on the resulting software. The modules shall be tested to withstand an equivalent load of 100, 500, and 1000 concurrent transactions. The test results at each level shall be clearly documented and the document shall be delivered to and discussed with PSA (Deliverable 11). In the case of test failures the contractor shall take remedial action and correct the software until it passes the failed test(s). Components and services shall be compatible and interoperable. Use of all hardware and software components and services is seamless. Solutions are easy to use and learn and add to user efficiency and satisfaction. Contractor shall document satisfaction level through user surveys and provide the results to the COTR. The contractor shall update the existent MS Word format PRISM User's and Administrator's manuals which describe all the screens and reports in PRISM. PSA considers books 1 and 2 the user's guide (Attachments 6 and 7) and book 3 the administrator's guide (Attachment 8). The contractor shall update only those sections affected by this effort and using everyday language (wherever possible). The updates shall describe the Graphical User Interface (GUI), menu structure, navigation paradigm, screens, modules, command buttons, responses, reports, and messages (Deliverables 12 and 13). The following subsections describe what the modules are supposed to accomplish from the user perspective. The detailed requirements are provided as an attachment see at the beginning of this section for details. 3.3.1.1.1. PSA Support, Treatment & Addiction Recovery Services

Currently PRISM Programs, Sessions and Reports Modules are used to schedule and document defendants attendance in treatment groups, but the current process is inadequate, time consuming and cumbersome. In addition, PRISM does not support the enhanced internal treatment program - PSA Support, Treatment & Addiction Recovery Services (PSA STARS). In order to fully implement PSA STARS, the system needs the ability to perform the following: 1. Place defendants in the PSA STARS program.
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 10 -

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

2. Schedule individual defendants for up to twelve (12) out of a possible one hundred (100) available session options. 3. Follow each session; enter bar coded defendant attendance and conduct/participation data. Staff should be able to enter as many coded conduct/participation remarks as apply. 4. Have this attendance and participation data viewable in PRISM. 5. Generate an attendance roster (report) of those scheduled to attend in advance of each session. 6. Generate a defendant-specific report detailing all of the sessions a defendant is scheduled to attend. 7. Generate a defendant-specific contact report detailing defendant session attendance. 8. Generate a defendant-specific summary report summarizing defendant group performance, both attendance and participation. 9. Provide quality assurance reports to monitor the program. 3.3.1.1.2. Electronic Monitoring Processing module (EM)

The Electronic Monitoring Processing module is a centralized location for recording and storing all electronic monitoring-related information in PRISM. This module will be used to record basic information on any defendant placed on electronic and location monitoring (address/phone information, docket number, equipment type, start and end dates), orientation information, installation and deinstallation information. Additionally, the module will assist with process management by creating reports for financial management, capturing electronic monitoring trends, and provide the ability to view summative data to report on current agency performance measures. . The original concept behind this module was based upon requirements identified in the current contract between PSA and its electronic monitoring vendor, G4S. The EM vendor will provide the data stream from its current system called Web Patrol II. This task will process that information, validate it, bring it into PRISM, and display it for the users. In addition to the interface, PSA identified the need to improve the communication between the agency and the EM vendor since the current processes relies heavily on paper. The module shall implement role based security depending upon user rights; persons accessing this module will see certain "views" (COTR, supervisor, contractor, assistant PSO, quality assurance, and PSO or case manager views). For example, the COTR and Supervisor views shall show the full list of defendants currently on electronic monitoring. The Contractor view shall show a list of defendants who PSA has requested equipment be installed, de-installed, or serviced. The assistant PSO view is a list of defendants currently awaiting program orientation. The PSO view shall list defendants currently assigned to that case manager's caseload. In addition to defendant's basic information such as address, phone, case number, ID, start date, and end date the system shall
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 11 -

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

list the status of the following indicators: Release Order (RO), Orientation (O), Installation (I), and De-Installation (De-I). Until completed, each status indicator is red and changes to blue while in progress and then green when done. In order to complete each step, users select a defendant which will take them to the "EM Wizard", a set of screens that track each step identified by the status indicators. 3.3.1.1.3. Streamlined Drug Testing module (SDTM)

The Streamlined Drug Testing module (SDTM) will implement workflow to simplify the current "check-in" and "drug testing" process for PSA and CSOSA drug units. PSA supervises defendant pre-adjudication and CSOSA supervises offenders post adjudication. The average supervision period for a client under PSA supervision is 180 days, and the average supervision period for CSOSA is 90 days to 2 years. During this time the majority of people are required to submit to regularly schedule illicit drug tests and the existing process requires users to go back and forth among the check-in, drug testing, and address modules to complete the process. In addition, the existing process does not accommodate the ability to track medication use and or cross reactivity. The objective of this task is to integrate the check-in and drug testing functionality in one module. The new module will incorporate `workflow' principles and use a streamlined approach to capture the necessary information and improve the intake process, and ultimate collection. By combining these screens our goal is to reduce the number errors, which are already low, and increase efficiency across the drug the units. Some of the issues this module will assist reducing will be drug tests and placements created for the wrong clients & offenders, duplicate drug records created for a client on the same date and check-ins created for a client & offender using a record from a previous date. In addition, having a new section to track medication will allow the laboratory personnel to check a medication's cross reactivity would allow the staff to have the information about possible cross reactivity information available during subsequent activities such as levels analysis. 3.3.1.2. Phase 1 ­ Task 2.0 ­ Refine requirements, design, and prototype

The contractor, working in partnership with the COTR shall gain a thorough understanding of the business process requiring coding. Key stakeholders shall be interviewed; inputs and outputs analyzed and practices and standards followed to successfully refine the user requirements document (Deliverable 14) gathered until then. Continue updating the requirements and field traceability matrix document (Deliverable 15.) The contractor shall document the design and workflow using MS Visio (Deliverable 16) and build working prototypes (Deliverable 17) of each of the following modules so they may be constructed in subsequent phases: a) Pretrial Services Officer Dashboard module b) Supervision, Treatment Case Review with Treatment Notes
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 12 -

c) d) e) f)

Streamlined Report Writing Process module Response to Defendant Conduct (Sanctions) and Incentives Event Chronology Check-in and Orientation

The contractor shall take the refined requirements, analyze them, design a solution, and build a working prototype (Deliverable 17) of the necessary components to implement each module. The working prototypes shall use the standards and guidelines set forth in the "PSA .NET Coding Standards & Best Practices" (Attachment 3) document and follow the "PRISM Data Architecture Standards" (Attachment 5) for the database and rely on the.Net Core Enterprise Library (Attachment 4.) The contractor shall deliver complete and tested working prototypes. The contractor shall create, update, and maintain MS Visio diagrams of each object, component, or service designed and implemented. The diagrams shall accurately depict each one of the object's interfaces and their parameters, and how they were combined to create a component or a service. Furthermore, the contractor shall create, update, and maintain a Visio flow chart and workflow of each PRISM subsystem. The diagrams shall be properly labeled, categorized, and stored inside the source code library (Deliverable 16). In addition, the contractor shall document the database design in an entity relationship diagram - ERD (Deliverable 18) and a data dictionary ­ DD document (Deliverable 19) and a requirements and field traceability matrix document (Deliverable 15). The following subsections describe what the modules are supposed to accomplish from the user perspective. 3.3.1.2.1. Pretrial Services Officer Dashboard module

Pretrial Services Officers (PSOs) assigned to the Supervision and Treatment programs are required to document an array of case management activities in PRISM on a regular basis in the course of supervising released defendants. These activities include but are not limited to assuming new cases; conducting treatment and supervision program orientations; writing reports to the court on defendants' supervision and treatment status; conducting warrant and record checks; and, investigating new bench warrants and loss of contact with defendants. Providing a Dashboard based on web parts which includes these time sensitive activities will enable PSOs to better organize and manage their workload. A Dashboard will also eliminate the officers' reliance on notification emails and PRISM reports that are in use today. The Dashboard will serve as an automatic "to-do list", an alert and notification system to assist PSOs to efficiently prioritize and manage their caseloads. The proposed PRISM Dashboard will provide PSOs an organized and centralized location where they can view pending and overdue tasks/activities. For example, the user's review of the Dashboard will obtain the names of
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 13 -

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

defendants recently assigned to his or her queue. This action would prompt the user to conduct a series of activities associated with assuming supervision of newly assigned defendants within the agency's specified time frame. The Dashboard will also allow users to prioritize and manage their tasks in accordance to agency policies in conjunction with supervision duties such as, meeting with defendants, and conducting sessions. In PRISM 3.5, the user will have a categorized snapshot of his or her required case management tasks from a daily and weekly point of view allowing him or her to efficiently manage workload. Each section or web part would list information by categories and in chronological order. It will also eliminate having to rely on reports such as the Agent Notification, Closeout compliance and Court date list. Below is a list of proposed web parts and items to be featured, at a minimum, in the Dashboard: 1. New Case Assigned; 2. Re-arrest; 3. Drug Test infractions; 4. Cases Transferred/closed; 5. Bench warrants; 6. Compliance review; 7. 60 day Criminal History record check; 8. Upcoming Court dates; 9. Court outcomes; 10. Sessions. Ideally, when a user logs into PRISM 3.5, it will open to the personalized Dashboard view. The user then selects and clicks on a web part, which would hyperlink to additional views, including lists, and or screens, providing the user with information prompting him or her to perform specific tasks/activities associated with the case. The Dashboard will have general tasks/activities applicable to both Supervision and Treatment programs. However, the Dashboard will also have a web part germane to a specific program. For example, Sessions, which would only be relevant to users assigned to Treatment. Although a Supervision PSO may choose to include it in his/her personalized view. The Dashboard will have a search feature for the user to conduct basic and advance searches for more detailed information. Additional features include a filtering or sorting mechanism, color changing indicator, functionality and printing capability. Web parts, views, and categories will be role-based, so program directors and supervisors will get consolidated views pertaining to their staff. 3.3.1.2.2. Supervision, Treatment Case Review with Treatment Notes

In order to effectively supervise defendants the Pretrial Services Officers (PSOs) must review newly assigned cases and develop treatment and or supervision
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 14 -

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

case plans as needed. The new module would allow a PSO to conduct a review of the case in accordance to the agency's policies and management instructions, and assume responsibility of the case for supervision or treatment and provide a centralized location for the PSO to identify risks and determine needs. The review encompasses the defendant's current active release conditions, criminal history, risk scores, and treatment and social service needs. Existing information in PRISM will pre-populate in the appropriate sections. Based on the known information or responses from the defendant, the gathered information is used to formulate strategies to address identified areas. If the defendant is assigned to the treatment program the PSO develops a treatment plan and sets the goals, objectives and methods to address the substance abuse needs. The completed treatment plan is a printable and binding document signed by both parties. Once the user exits the screen, a standardized remark documenting the assumption of the case or the conducting of an orientation will automatically populate in the Supervision Log. Currently, PSOs are required to conduct a review of an assigned case at its inception, and when release conditions have been modified. If a case warrants intervention, including referrals and placements for substance abuse, mental health and social services needs, then the PSO is required to address them. However, there is no uniform process and or procedures, resulting in inconsistencies and inaccuracies. PRISM 3.5 will create an individualized plan of action based on the court-ordered release conditions, risks, needs and the social service areas identified. The PSO will use the plan to identify a defendant's risk, assess a defendant's needs, and provide a defendant with opportunities to participate in programs or to obtain services to address identified needs. Furthermore, the plan (i.e. treatment plan) will allow the user to document the PSO's and defendant's agreed upon goals, methods and objectives for the defendant's substance abuse and or mental health treatment. This screen will also allow the assignment of the defendant to a particular treatment group sessions or groups. PRISM 3.5 will also have the capability to produce a printable report of the Treatment Plan that contains the information provided. The treatment plan provides a section for both the PSO and defendant to sign, and a copy provided to the defendant as a treatment client. To enhance the agency's ability to capture, store, and retrieve defendants clinical history and the quality of treatment services delivered to defendant's the PRISM must be able to capture clinical progress review notes in a secured manner. Currently, clinical information is documented in a Microsoft word document. The assigned PSO is required to document the nature of each individual clinical session conducted with their defendant by typing a clinical note in a Microsoft Word template. Individual notes are stored on this template until the page becomes complete with notes and then the PSO prints the page, signs each individual note, and places the page in the defendant's supervision/clinical file. The file is stored in the PSO's file cabinet until the defendant's case reaches final
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 15 -

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

disposition. The file is stored in accordance with agency records management procedures. This process decreases the Treatment Division's ability to quickly access defendant's progress in their current treatment episode and makes it's challenging to retrieve defendant's prior clinical history. Automated clinical information would allow treatment staff to easy obtain defendant's current clinical information and also historical information which should increase the Treatment Programs ability to provide services. To automate clinical notes requires a new log in PRISM. This log should populate in Supervision Log as follows: ˇ ˇ ˇ Type ­ "Remarks ­ Substance Abuse" Subtype ­ "Clinical Note" Comments ­ Blank space for free text information.

The permission to create and view (encrypted) clinical notes will be limited to PSOs in the treatment programs (Drug Court and New Directions), clinical services specialists, treatment coordinators, special assistant to the director of treatment, deputy director of treatment, and the director of treatment. There will be an electronic signature capability to sign clinical notes. Signed clinical notes will be permanent log without an edit feature. 3.3.1.2.3. Streamlined Report Writing Process module

Report writing in PRISM frequently involves exporting a partially completed report from PRISM to WORD, editing that report in WORD, and then saving the completed document to user's shared drive. The finished product is neither saved in PRISM nor can it be regenerated within the system. The current practice of "saving" the report in PRISM involves copying the body of the document and then pasting that information into the supervision log that was created when the report was initially generated. In addition to the previously mentioned deficiencies the process of reviewing, correcting, and editing a report is inefficient because the supervisory review, communication of needed edits, and receipt of information about those edits by the PSO are all conducted outside of PRISM. This requires the user to rewrite the report after the supervisor's review. In PRISM 3.5, users need to be able to create, submit, edit, and review reports directly in PRISM. Reviewing and editing reports should be able to be completed electronically relying on a paperless system. Although primarily an electronic process, in PRISM 3.5 users should be able to print a report at any stage in the process, such as a final copy for court, and original or edited versions for QA/performance review purposes. The complete report writing process should be self contained within PRISM without the need to export any documents into another database such as WORD. PRISM 3.5 report writing also needs to provide the user with the ability to select recommendations from a dropdown
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 16 -

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

table or other suitable tool so that this information is not limited to having to be added "freehand" by the report writer. However, in PRISM 3.5 the user will still have the ability to add "free hand" text as needed. Lastly, PRISM 3.5 should allow user to print a condensed report detailing the defendant's release condition infraction(s). The user will also have the functionality to add free hand text within a section of the report. Finally at the generation of any report PRISM 3.5will automatically log in the Supervision Log an entry denoting a report was printed. The log remark would include the type of report, judge's name, infractions (if indicated) and recommendations (if required). 3.3.1.2.4. Response to Defendant Conduct (Sanctions) and Incentives

The response to defendant conduct (sanctions) and incentives module in PRISM 3.5 needs to be constructed based upon the policies, procedures, and processes identified in the Responses to Defendant Conduct Management Instruction (Attachment 17) currently in draft form. Special consideration should be made to align the new module with the Response Grids that identify the options available when defendants incur condition infractions. The PRISM 3.5 Sanctions & Incentives Module should be built so that noncompliant events by defendants automatically display within the module. When a defendant incurs a drug testing check-in, or curfew infraction, the sanction will populate into the sanctions and incentive module. The module will also have the option for a PSO to manually add a sanction. Furthermore, the administrative and judicial response options available to a user should be broad so that a case manager is not "boxed in" by having a limited selection from which to choose. Developing the module in this manner will increase the probability that sanctions will be addressed and documented within PRISM. 3.3.1.2.5. Event Chronology

The purpose of the event chronology module as a PRISM requirement is to provide the user a "snapshot" of a defendant's compliance with court-ordered conditions from all active cases. This module will include drug test results, check-in results, curfew call dispositions, supervision log entries, and PSO responses, including sanctions and incentives. Currently, users view Event Chronology in the PRISM, using filters that are hard to use and do not allow the user to view the log in its entirety (See PRISM screen shot below). Enhancing the Event Chronology in the PRISM or by other means will provide a more efficient way for PSOs to retrieve defendant active conditions and compliance information in one view. The enhanced Event Chronology module will need the ability to provide an organized and complete snapshot of the drug test results, supervision log and check in log. This requirement also includes the
M:\data\SOW2010\P3.5\PWS-FY10-P35-July2010.doc - 17 -

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

functionality of displaying, when chosen, the full supervision log entry as a hypertext or other link, without the user losing the original place in the active Supervision Log Event Chronology screen. Filtering and sorting needs to be available both chronologically and by content, allowing the user to choose between grouping categories and selecting chronological order. Additionally, the drop downs and filters in Event Chronology will be reviewed and revised to ensure they mirror the categories (i.e. warrant checks, court reports, orientations, PSO assumed supervision...) in the Supervision Log. The user will have the ability to filter within the Event Chronology, all categories, including court reports that PSOs sent to court. 3.3.1.2.6. Check-in and Orientation

Pretrial Services Officers (PSOs) must document all contacts with defendants through a process known as a "check-in." Check-ins can occur in person or over the phone. These contacts often result in the PSO conducting a series of activities or actions involving numerous PRISM entries. To streamline the data entry process, PRISM 3.5 will allow for the entry of data in one module or screen for routine contacts with defendants. The data will then populate in all relevant fields in PRISM. Currently, when checking in either by telephone or in person, the defendant is required to acknowledge their address and next court date. The PSA employee is to review other information such as upcoming activities and recent drug test results. Once the entry is completed in the check-in module, the PSO or APSO must then make entries in the Supervision Log documenting the contact made, the results of the warrant check and any referrals made during the contact. Defendants placed in specialize programs are required to complete an orientation session. The orientation session provides the defendant with a detailed description of the programs requirements. The assigned PSO is required to document in PRISM, multiple entries to capture the defendant's completion of orientation. First, a warrant check is conducted prior to orientation to determine if the defendant has an active warrant and the status is documented in the system. Second, the PSO enters weather or not the defendant reported for orientation, if it was accepted into treatment or into a specialized supervision program. Third, the PSO created entries for employment status and or prints referrals. The new module shall allow users to capture multiple entries at once and save time increasing efficiency. In PRISM 3.5, a check-in module will allow the user to perform the standard check-in functions by telephone or in person and acknowledge a series of tasks completed at the check-in such as warrant check, address verified, court date acknowledged, reviewed release conditions, and referrals given to the defendant. Once the PSO completes the check-in, all required documentation will log in both

D.C. Pretrial Services Agency Office of Information Technology (OIT) System Development and IT Security Team

the check-in module and the supervision log. The PSO will also have a free text box to allow other pertinent information from the contact to be entered. Documentation in several modules, and or screens have resulted in users' errors and missed information. Therefore, PRISM 3.5 will ensure all activities are documented on one module using wizards. 3.3.2.
