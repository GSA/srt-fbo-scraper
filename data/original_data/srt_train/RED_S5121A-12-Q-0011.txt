CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT

52.204-99 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT REGISTRATION (DEVIATION)(AUG 2012) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. "Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-- (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code." "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the SAM database" means that-- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; (2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. "System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes-- (1) Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;

S5121A-12-Q-0011 Page 5 of 33 (2) Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and (3) The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office. (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4. (3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in CCR may be required in lieu of SAM. (c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number-- (i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business name. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code. (iv) Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company telephone number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) Reserved. (e) Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering. Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-- (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or changeof-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's

S5121A-12-Q-0011 Page 6 of 33 SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: __X__ Award will be made to the offeror whose quote complies with the RFQ, meets the Technical Specifications, represents the best value to the Government considering technical qualifications, past performance and price. __X__ Non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price and more value will be placed on them than price as the Government makes a best value determination. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

252.209-9000 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST a. Purpose. The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that: (1) the Contractor's objectivity and judgment are not biased because of its past, present, or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to work under this contract; (2) the Contractor does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its access to non-public information regarding the Government's program plans and actual or anticipated resources; and (3) by virtue of its access to proprietary information belonging to others, the Contractor does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage. b. Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. (1) Maintenance of Objectivity: The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited or unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract. Furthermore, unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not perform any services under this contract on any of its own products or services, or the products or services of another firm if the Contractor is, or has been, substantially involved in their development or marketing. In addition, if the Contractor under this contract prepares a complete, or essentially complete, Statement of Work to be used in competitive acquisitions, the contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based on such Statement of Work or specifications. Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the contractor from competing for follow-on contracts involving the same or similar services. (2) Access To and Use of Government Information: If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to Government information such as plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, or data which has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, it shall not: (a) use such information for any private purpose unless the information has been released or otherwise made available to the public; (b) compete for work based on such information .until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; (c) submit an unsolicited

S5121A-12-Q-0011 Page 18 of 33 proposal to the Government which is based on such information until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; and (d) release such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise made available to the public by the Government. (3) Access To and Protection of Proprietary Information: The Contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, trade secrets, or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information (hereinafter referred to as "proprietary data") under this contract, it shall not use or

disclose such information for any purpose other than providing the contract support services, and will not use or disclose the information for any personal or other commercial purpose. The Contractor
further agrees to enter into a written agreement for the protection of the proprietary data of others and to exercise diligent effort to protect such proprietary data from unauthorized use or disclosure. A copy of each such written agreement shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain from each employee who has access to proprietary data under this contract, a written agreement which shall in substance provide that such employee shall not, during his/her employment by the Contractor or thereafter, disclose to others or use for their benefit, proprietary data received in connection with the work under this Contract. c. Subcontracts: The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in consulting agreements and subcontracts of any tier when directed by the Contracting Officer. The terms "contract," "Contractor," and "Contracting Officer" will be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. d. Representations and Disclosures: (1) The Contractor represents that it has disclosed to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, all facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflict of interests as that term is used in FAR Subpart 9.5. (2) The Contractor agrees that if after award it discovers an organizational conflict of interest with respect to this contract, prompt and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer which shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts. e. Remedies and Waiver: (1) For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be disclosed during this contract, the Government may terminate this contract for default, disqualify the Contractor for subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. If, however, in compliance with this clause, the Contractor discovers and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest (or potential therefore) subsequent to contract award, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if such termination is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government. (2) The parties recognize that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which this clause might be applied in the future and that the clause has effect which will survive the performance of this contract. Accordingly, the Contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Contracting Officer by submitting a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the Head of Contracting Activity will grant such a waiver in writing. f. Modifications: Prior to a contract modification, when the Statement of Work is changed to add new work or the period of performance is significantly increased, the Contracting Officer will request, and the Contractor is required to submit, either an organizational conflict of interest disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.

CONTRACTOR NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
CONTRACT NO. _____________________ DELIVERY/TASK ORDER NO. _______ _______________________________(hereinafter (employee) and _______________ (hereinafter "agent") are employees of ___________________________________ (hereinafter "contractor"). The contractor is providing support services to the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and is likely to have access to nonpublic information. We, both in a personal, private, professional and employment capacity to the contractor, understand that:

When used in this agreement the term "nonpublic information" is information generally not available to the public, includes Government generated information or information obtained by the Government in the course of Government employee's official duties or position, which would normally not be releasable under the Freedom of Information Act.

Proprietary information, also known as a trade secret, is information that a company wishes to keep confidential or protected from those outside the company. The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) defines trade secrets as "information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known, and that is kept secret through reasonable actions." Proprietary information can include, but is not limited to secret formulas, processes, and methods used in production. It can also include a company's business and marketing plans, salary structure, customer lists, contracts, and computer systems. In some cases, the special knowledge and skills that an employee has learned on the job are considered to be a company's proprietary information. Personal Privacy Information is any information, record item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his personal address, social security number, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph; THEREFORE, we, both in our personal, private, professional and employment capacity to the contractor
agree and promise: Not to seek access to nonpublic information beyond what is required for the performance of the support services contract; To ensure that my status as a contractor employee is known when seeking access to and receiving such nonpublic information from Government employees; Not to use or disclose such non-public information for any purpose other than providing the contract support services; this includes not disclosing such non-public information to anyone within the company unless required for the contract support services;

S5121A-12-Q-0011 Page 21 of 33

Not to use or disclose the information for any personal, professional or any other purpose; Not to email or remove, in any manner, any information used during the course of the contract, without prior written permission from the Contracting Officer; and To promptly notify the Contracting Officer and the DCMA Office of Counsel of any attempt by an individual (including any contractor personnel, company or Government Representative) to gain unauthorized access to nonpublic information, and of any disclosure of such information to unauthorized parties. Such notification shall include the name and organization, if available, of the individual, company or Government Representative seeking access to such information. To return any nonpublic information given to me pursuant to this agreement, including any transcriptions of nonpublic information to which I was given access, (if not already destroyed). The contractor and I understand that any unauthorized use, release or disclosure of nonpublic information in violation of this agreement will subject me and the contractor to administrative, civil or criminal remedies as may be authorized by law. The contractor and I acknowledge that the owner of any proprietary information improperly disclosed stands as an intended third-party beneficiary of this non-disclosure agreement. In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information, the owner of the information may seek legal recovery under this nondisclosure agreement, even though the information owner is not a formal party to the agreement. The contractor and I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the United States Government from any claim or action for any damages caused by his/her improper handling or disclosure of such information received. The contractor and I understand that an improper release of such information may subject the contractor, it, him/her and his/her company or institution, to administrative and civil remedies by the Government, including those discussed below. The undersigned understands that improper handling or disclosure of such information received from the Government may be considered by the Government as relating to suspension and debarment as Part 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and that any improper handling of such information received may also be considered as an issue of contractor responsibility under FAR 9.1, and further may be considered in evaluating past performance under the FAR.. Further, any willful mishandling may subject him/her, his/her company or institution to administrative or criminal penalties under several statutes including, but not limited to, the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831, and the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. The aforementioned nonpublic information is Government property and the theft, or conversion without authority, of such property is potentially punishable under 18 U.S.C. 641. A breach of this agreement will be considered a breach of the contract and may be reason for termination for default or termination for cause.

The Government will utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov to evaluate contractor past performance for those contractors having previously performed on a Federal Government contract(s). PPIRS is a web-enabled, government-wide application that collects quantifiable and narrative contractor past performance information from all Federal contracting agencies and provides a contractor's previous performance based on Federal Stock Class (FSC) or Product Service Code (PSC). In the event no information is available in PPIRS, the offeror may be requested to submit information on past and current Federal, State and local government as well as private sector contracts performed by the offeror within the last three years that are similar in nature to this acquisition; or may assign a neutral rating for the offeror.

END SECTION L EVALUATION AND AWARD CRITERIA Quotes submitted in response to this RFQ will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below. It is imperative that offerors respond directly to each area specified and to ensure that their quote is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Responses which merely repeat the Technical Requirements cannot be considered as being responsive to the requirements of the RFQ. Assurances of experience, capability or qualifications, without a clear demonstration to support the claim, may adversely influence the evaluation of the quote. The Government will be making a best value award decision. Offers will be reviewed and evaluated to determine which offers comply with the solicitation requirements and provides the best value to the government. Evaluation of the offers will be based upon the following factors: Technical Approach, Operational Software Maintenance and Support, Licensing Agreements, Installation, Past Performance and Price. The non-price factors are of equal importance and when combined are significantly more important than price. If two or more offers are equal with respect to their overall non-price factors, price will become the deciding factor. Evaluation of price will be accomplished separately from the technical evaluation. Once the non-price submissions have been evaluated, the evaluated quotations/ proposals will then be compared to the price quotes as submitted to determine the best overall value for the Government.

PART I ­ Administrative Data Quotes that fail to furnish the required information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.

PART II - Technical Factor 1 - Technical Approach Specifications - The offeror must demonstrate in their proposal the ability to provide equipment and ancillary services that meets or exceeds the Government's required minimum Technical Specifications. 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) 7) Run-time System Configuration Service Desk Incident Management Self-Service Problem Management Analytics Reporting Tool Knowledge Base

S5121A-12-Q-0011 Page 32 of 33 Offerors approaches for resolution of anticipated difficulties and problems areas will be evaluated to determine if the approach for resolution indicates a realistic ability to perform the requirements. Authorized reseller of the proposed solution. Factor 2 - Operational Software Maintenance and Support Offeror will be evaluated based on meeting the government's requirements for a 8 years of software maintenance and support, and continued integration troubleshooting services. The offeror must describe how issues or problems will be identified and resolved. Proposals will be evaluated to determine if the offeror can rapidly respond to problems. Factor 3 - Licensing Agreements Software Licensing Agreement(s) will be reviewed to determine 1) consistency with Federal law; and 2) meets the Government's needs. The license will be determined acceptable or not acceptable.

Factor 4 - Installation Installation will be evaluated to determine if it meets the government's minimum requirements. PART III - Past Performance Factor 5 - Past Performance Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine how well the offeror demonstrated compliance with prior contract requirements for work similar in nature to the work described in the Technical Specification. The Government will utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov to evaluate contractor past performance for those contractors having previously performed on a Federal Government contract(s). PPIRS is a web-enabled, government-wide application that collects quantifiable and narrative contractor past performance information from all Federal contracting agencies and provides a contractor's previous performance based on Federal Stock Class (FSC) or Product Service Code (PSC). A neutral rating may be applied for any contractor not having data available within PPIRS. The Government may also consider past performance information obtained through source(s) provided from the offeror or other sources. Past performance information will be evaluated based upon a comparative assessment among offerors.

PART IV ­ Price Factor 6 - Price The total offered price will be determined by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirements. An offer may be rejected or not be considered for award if it is materially unbalanced. An offer is considered to be materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less for some deliverables and prices which are significantly higher for other similar deliverables; and/or when discrepancies are present between prices for the basic requirement and prices for the option requirement. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s). Offerors price proposal must include Attachment 2, Pricing Spreadsheet, containing the offerors proposed price. Any significant inconsistency, if unexplained, raises a fundamental issue of the offerors understanding of the nature and scope of the work required. It also may reflect on the offerors ability to perform the contract within financial restraints and may be cause for not selecting the proposal for award.

S5121A-12-Q-0011 Page 33 of 33 Evaluation of price will be accomplished separately from the technical evaluation. Once the technical proposals have been evaluated, the evaluated technical proposals will then be compared to the price proposals as submitted to determine the best overall buy for the Government.
