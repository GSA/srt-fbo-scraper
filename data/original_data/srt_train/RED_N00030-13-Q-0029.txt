TECHNICAL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR STRATEGIC SYSTEMS PROGRAMS ACQUISITIONS

1. SCOPE 1.1 PURPOSE. This document delineates the set of requirements for technical program management applicable to Navy Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) acquisitions throughout the product life cycle. The primary purpose is to define the management actions and technical disciplines to be invoked on contractors and selected suppliers to assure acquisition of a weapon system that will achieve operational requirements. These management actions and technical disciplines include: management; design; RAM; test programs; configuration management program; supplier management; production; and test and measuring equipment and standards. Quality system requirements are integrated throughout this document. This document also encompasses requirements for management of these technical disciplines that are consistent with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), FAR supplements, and appropriate Department of Defense, Department of Navy, and SSP directives and instructions. 1.2 APPLICABILITY. The requirements of this document are applicable to: a. Prime contractors and selected suppliers engaged in designing, developing, producing, or supporting subsystems, equipment, software and other items for Navy SSP acquisitions. The prime contractor shall recommend where T9001B will apply to suppliers in accordance with paragraph 3.6.4. The total contractor organization. In no way is it implied that these requirements are solely the responsibility of a particular organizational element.

b.

The requirements of this document must be checklisted (tailored) for each contract based on the scope of the contract, product being procured, and program phase. This document is structured as a checklist with the requirements identified by fixed lineal numbers, which appear on the left to provide an easy reference to the checklist item. The columns at the right are provided to support tailoring. These checklists are to be prepared and submitted to support compliance with SSPINST 4295.2. To facilitate the SSP review process, the checklist developers are encouraged to document their supporting rationale for any significant modifications. The first of the two columns allow an entry identifying whether the specific item is to apply (Yes, No, or as Modified). If the paragraph is modified, the modification shall be incorporated and maintained as part of the checklist. Deleted text shall be shown as lined-out text (e.g. Aaaaa bbbbb ccccc.) and added text shall be shown as underlined text (e.g. Xxxxx yyyyy zzzzz.). The use of lined-out, underlined, bolded, italicized, or any other highlighted font in the T9001B text is for the sole purpose of tailoring the T9001B for this particular contract. Other than this purpose, there is no legal significance attached to these highlighted modifications to the T9001B text. Cognizant SSP Branch approval and SP2015 concurrence signatures shall constitute agreement for all such deletions and additions. The second column identifies documentation to be submitted to the Government (no entry meaning no submission, and a letter entry signifying submission for Approval (A) or for Information (I)). Each document required by the checklist to be submitted to the Government shall have a corresponding data item entry in the Contract Data Requirements List. The completed checklist shall specify the applicability of each numbered requirement. When appropriate, the contractor should participate in developing a checklist that is compatible with, and augments as necessary, the contractor's existing management and technical systems. To aid in the tailoring process, Appendix B provides a cross reference of the requirements of this document to ANSI/ISO/ASQ Q9001-2000 and ANSI/ASQC Q9001-1994.

T9001B, Change 2 07 November 2007 1.3 DEFINITIONS a. Acceptance Test and Inspection: Acceptance Test and Inspection relates to those test and inspection operations that form a basis for Government buy-off decisions for deliverable products, including spares. Certified Process: Any process where acceptable quality of the finished item is not, or cannot be readily determined by test and inspection. 1. Processes where "acceptable quality of the finished item is not readily determined by test and inspection" are processes where specified tests and/or inspections are not performed as a result of written agreement (deviation) with SSP. Processes where "acceptable quality of the finished item cannot be readily determined by test and inspection" are processes where the test and/or inspection methods used would result in destruction of the finished item. (These processes are also known as Special Processes.)

b.

2.

c.

Certified Supplier: A supplier that has demonstrated, to both the prime contractor's and the Government's satisfaction, that they continuously produce a particular product in conformance to contract/purchase order requirements and the criteria set forth by a prime contractor's certified supplier system (3.6.10.2). Supplier certifications are for a particular product from a particular supplier. Commercial Items: Products or equipment developed by industry for sale in the general commercial marketplace. Commercial items may include modifications, provided the modifications are either: 1. 2. Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace. Of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace, which do not alter the non-governmental function, essential physical characteristics of an item or component, or change the purpose of a process.

d.

e.

Computer Software Configuration Item: An aggregation of computer software components and/or computer software units which are at a level of integration designated by the Government for separate configuration management. Computer Software Component: Any aggregation of computer software units and/or other computer software components at a level of integration below that of a computer software configuration item. Computer Software Unit: The lowest element specified in the design of a computer software component that is separately testable. Establish and Maintain: Establish and maintain includes planning, developing, preparing, implementing, documenting, assessing, updating, and performing. Facility Location: The location where the purchased item is actually built or produced. This does not include the location of a vendor or distributor who simply sells supplies that they do not produce. Government Controlled Areas: Those areas where the Government has Technical Program Management responsibility. These areas are specified in OD 55512 66768 and OD 63526.

T9001B, Change 2 07 November 2007 k. Government Part or Identifying Number: Military specification number, Federal specification number, or Government authenticated/approved part or identifying number. Government Representative: Shall be considered as applying to the cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency Office unless otherwise specified by SSP. Guide: Documents identified as guides are considered an information resource and may be used by contractors, as appropriate, to provide a degree of consistency within the program. Guides are not considered to be binding requirements. Inspection and Test Status Indication: Documentation, either attached to the item or contained within the item's production and quality control record, that indicates that the item has successfully completed planned manufacturing, test, and inspection operations. Life Cycle: All phases of the system's life including: research, development, test, and evaluation; production; deployment; operations and support; and disposal. Non-Developmental Items: Any previously developed item used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the U.S. has a mutual defense cooperation agreement. Non-developmental items can require minor modification in order to meet the requirements of the agency. Items that are developed and will soon be used by the Federal, State, local, or foreign government are also considered non-developmental items. Record: A document, in either hard copy or electronic format, that is used to report and preserve data. Special Test and Inspection Equipment: Either single or multipurpose integrated test and inspection units engineered, designed, fabricated, or modified to accomplish special purpose testing in the performance of the contract. Such units comprise electrical, electronic, hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical, or other items or assemblies of equipment, that are mechanically, electrically, or electronically interconnected so as to become a new functional entity, causing the individual item or items to become interdependent and essential in the performance of special purpose test and inspection. SSP: SSP shall be considered as also applying to a designated Government representative of SSP. Supplier: Supplier includes subcontractors and vendors.

1.0  Overview:  This Requirements Document contains compliance, performance, and user requirements related to the Security Forces Qualification and Certification Management Tool for NW Security Forces (Navy and Marine) assigned to Strategic Weapons Facilities, Atlantic and Pacific (SWFLANT & SWFPAC).  This effort supports manpower management for Marine Corps Security Force Battalions, Kings Bay and Bangor. The intent is to capitalize on existing software technologies to reduce the working load and man hours spent tracking, verifying security force qualifications and certifications, and watchbill generation. 



1.1  Background:  Marine Corps Security Force Battalions Kings Bay and Bangor assigned to Strategic Weapons Facilities, Atlantic and Pacific (SWFLANT & SWFPAC) have identified the need to eliminate or reduce recurring errors in the process of identifying and ensuring that qualified and Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) certified individuals stand post in accordance with references. The task of maintaining and managing accurate training, qualifications and certification data is complicated by having multiple entry processes and tools to track security personnel training and PRP information.  As many as five separate information applications currently have to be maintained and tracked to verify security personnel qualifications. 

The Security Forces need the ability to centralize, merge and automate these processes and tools, increase efficiencies by reducing replicated efforts, automate data merging, and provide single point auditing.  In addition, centralized data management, entry and storage will reduce opportunity for human error and provide single source training reports and watch bill generation. 



1.2  Purpose:  The Security Forces Qualification and Certification Management Tool will provide Marine Corps Security Force Battalion (MCSFBn) leadership with a management tool to identify, track and assign individual security force member(s) qualifications for duties.  Additionally, the software shall provide:

1.2.1.  An application capable of generating an accurate security watchbill containing only qualified and Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) certified personnel. (KPP1)

1.2.2.  An application that supports a web based configuration, accessible from remote sites. (KPP2)

1.2.3.  An application capable of being hosted on or accessible from existing SSP hardware without the use of additional hardware or personnel. (KPP3)

1.2.4.  An application that will provide senior leadership with an ability to conduct reviews of administrative, training and PRP status, monitor qualification timelines and objective qualifying evidence (OQE) of individual(s) qualifications and certifications. (KPP4)

1.2.5.  An application that provides training department personnel with a single source for tracking, and verifying individual security force member training and qualification requirements. (KPP5)

1.1.6.  An application that allows Watchbill Reviewing Officials (ROs) with a means to review and validate individual security force members for their assigned duties. (KPP6)

1.1.7  An application that will notify the chain of command via email when an individual’s PRP status changes. (KPP7)

1.3. Concept:

1.3.1  Concept definitions:  The following definitions frame the operational concept of the Security Forces Qualification and Certification Management Tool as shown in example (figure 2).

Watchbill.  The Watchbill is a schedule made to assign qualified personnel to a security watch (guard).  See example (figure 1). 

Operational Area (OA).  The Operational Area is a section or designated area made up of posts, ECPs and other guard stations.  An example of an Operational Area is an Armory.  More than one Operational Area may be assigned to a watchbill.

Posts.  Posts are areas of security assigned to an OA.  Posts may be ECPs, Guard stations, guard towers, Sergeant of the Guard (SOG), Corporal of the Guard (COG), or Officer of the Day (OD).  Multiple posts can be assigned to an OA.  Post may be assigned to a watchbill independent of an OA.  Post requirements will be a combination of PRP status, required JQRs and Other Training Requirements such as weapons qualifications. 

Job Qualification Requirements (JQR).  JQRs are a list of training requirements and On the Job Training (OJT) called Under Instruction Watches or UIs.  A sentry has to accomplish these in order to stand that post.  Individual JQR requirements will be signed by the supervisor and completed JQRs will be signed by unit Commanders. More than one JQR can be required per post.  JQR can be assigned to multiple Posts.

Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). The PRP is a DoD program which requires training and evaluation to be conducted and certified by an official prior to an individual standing post. Personnel without current PRP status UP or green are not eligible to stand post.

Other Training requirements.  Other training and certification will be required to stand post. These may include weapons, qualifications, drivers’ license, or other personnel training listed on the individual’s personal training page.

1.3.2  The Security Forces Qualification and Certification Management Tool will allow the creation of accurate watchbills (Figure 1) by mapping and tracking all training requirements, qualifications and certification and ensuring that individuals assigned to post are qualified to stand that post.  Requirement and certification flow is outlined in the example provided in (Figure 2)

1.4.  Assumptions and Constraints:

1.4.1.  Assumptions:

The following assumptions were considered in developing requirements for the Security Forces Qualification and Certification Management Tool effort:

The Commanding Officer of the SWF and the Battalions are designated as PRP Reviewing Officials (RO).

The SWF and Battalion PRP officers are designated as the PRP Certifying Officials

The servers on which the application will be installed will be UNCLASSIFIED and reside on the government network.

All security forces assigned to a SWF/BN will be included in the application.

The application will be operated and maintained by SWF/BN security and training personnel.



1.4.2.  Constraints:

The following constraints were considered in developing requirements for the Security Forces Qualification and Certification Management Tool effort:



1.  There are limited numbers of user terminals in the battalion.

2.  Replication of data that is managed in other sources is minimized to reduce work and
     potential errors.



1.5.  Change Requests:



Any requests for changes to this document shall be submitted in writing to SP30.  Change requests will be reviewed by all signatories and incorporated / rejected based on their recommendations.


2.  Applicable Documents.  

	The following Specifications, standards, and handbooks form a part of this document to the extent specified in this requirements document.



2.1  References







Table 1










3.  Requirements: 

	a.  The Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are those attributes or characteristics of the application that are considered critical or essential to the development of an effective capability. KPPs are outlined in paragraph 3.1.

	b.  Precedence is identified as either “Threshold” (T) indicates a minimum feature, parameter, or requirement and “Objective” (O) indicates a desired feature, parameter, or requirement.  Some requirement statements include both a threshold and objective component (T/O).  The appropriate value for the statement is indicated in the Threshold/Objective column of Table 1. For T/O statements, the portions are marked with the symbols [T] and [O].  

	c. The qualification provisions (QP) or methods for verification of the requirements are:



(T) Test – A verification method by which performance is measured through controlled application of a functional and/or environmental stimulus. The resulting quantitative measurements are evaluated to determine the degree of compliance.



(A) Analysis – A verification method that uses mathematical models, simulations, algorithms, or other scientific principles and procedures to provide evidence that stated requirements were met. It includes the assessment of accumulated data through reduction, interpolation, extrapolation, etc., or assessment of technical data of similar component units.



(D) Demonstration – A verification method generally used to observe the actual operation of items to provide evidence of functional and/or other expected outputs under specific scenarios.



(I) Inspection – A verification method used to determine conformance to specified requirements through examination of the item or associated documentation. Inspection is generally nondestructive and typically includes the use of visual, mechanical, and/or electrical measurements.  The appropriate method to be used for each requirement is listed in the (QP) column in Table 2 using either T, A, D, or I. The verification of compliance of threshold requirements in this RD is a condition of acceptance by SP321 and 164. Verification of compliance with objectives is not required unless directed by SP321 and 164.

N00030-13-R-0029 Page 9 of 102

1.7.1

Open Architecture

The Contractor shall develop and maintain an architecture that incorporates appropriate considerations for reconfigurability, portability, maintainability, technology insertion, vendor independence, reusability, scalability, interoperability, upgradeability, and long-term supportability. Ensure that external information exchange requirements are implemented in a standard and open manner as part of this effort. These actions shall include planning that identifies the Contractor's specific approach to ensuring system and interface data is well-defined, available to all programs, and uses a standards-based tool for definition within the context of DoD and Service upgrade programs. The Contractor shall develop system upgrades, IT system capabilities and business rules that ensure that: 1) data shall be posted to shared spaces for users to access and download except when limited by security, policy, or regulations; 2) data shall provide for interoperability with many-to-many exchanges of data, and verified trust and integrity of users and applications; and 3) data shall be transmitted through well and openly defined interfaces. 1.7.2 Modular, Open Design The Contractor shall develop an architecture that is layered and modular and uses standardsbased COTS/NDI operating systems and middleware that all utilize either non-proprietary or non-vendor-unique key module or component interfaces. The Contractor's design approach shall be applied to all subsystems. As part of its open system management plan, the Contractor shall be required, at a minimum, to describe how the proposed system architecture meets these goals, including the steps taken to use non-proprietary or non-vendor unique COTS or reusable NDI components wherever practicable. 1.7.2.1 Module Coupling The Contractor's design approach shall result in modules that have minimal dependencies on other modules (loose coupling), as evidenced by simple, well-defined interfaces and by the absence of implicit data sharing. The purpose is to ensure that any changes to one module shall not necessitate extensive changes to other modules, and hence facilitate module replacement and system enhancement. The approach used to determine the level of coupling and the design tradeoff approach shall be described. 1.7.2.2 Module Cohesion The Contractor's design shall result in modules that are characterized by the singular assignment of identifiable, and discrete functionality (high cohesion). The purpose is to ensure that any changes to system behavioral requirements can be accomplished by changing a minimum number of modules within the system. The approach used to determine the level of cohesion and the design trade-off approach shall be described. 1.7.3 System Requirements Accountability The Contractor shall be required to ensure that all system requirements (including those contained in the Initial Capabilities Document, Capabilities Development Document, Capabilities Production Document, and in this SOW) are accounted for through a demonstrated ability to trace each requirement to one or more modules that consist of components that are selfcontained elements with well-defined, open and published interfaces implemented using open standards.

1.7.4

Inter-component Dependencies

The Contractor's design approach shall result in a layered system design, maximizing software independence from the hardware, thereby facilitating technology refresh. The design shall be optimized at the lowest component level to minimize inter-component dependencies. The layered design shall also isolate the application software layers from the infrastructure software (such as the operating system) to enhance portability and to facilitate technology refresh. The design shall be able to survive a change to the computing infrastructure with minimal or no changes required to the application logic. The interfaces between the layers shall be built to open standards or the technical data and computer software describing the interface shall be available to the Government with at least Government Purpose Rights. The system architecture shall minimize inter-component dependencies to allow components to be decoupled and reused across various DoD or Service programs and platforms. 1.7.5 Design Information Documentation The Contractor shall document and model the system or component (e.g., software, middleware) design information using industry standard formats (e.g., Unified Modeling Language). It shall also document and model how it shall use tools that are capable of exporting model information in a standard format (e.g., Extensible Markup Language Metadata Interchange (XMI) and AP233/ISO 10303). The contractor shall identify the proposed standards and formats to be used. The contractor shall maintain the design information, including any models used, so that the design information and models are current with the as-built system. 1.7.6 Technology Insertion The Contractor's architectural approach shall support the rapid and affordable insertion and refreshment of technology through modular design, the use of open standards and open interfaces. The Contractor shall define the functional partitioning and the physical modularity of the system to facilitate future replacement of specific subsystems and components without impacting other parts of the system and to encourage third-party vendor's participation. 1.7.7 Life Cycle Sustainability The Contractor shall consider use of COTS/NDI and open standards to enhance the system's life cycle sustainability by implementing performance-based logistics (PBL) arrangements to sustain the components through their life cycle. 1.7.8 ˇ ˇ ˇ Interface Design and Management Clearly define and describe all system interfaces; Define and document all subsystem and configuration item (CI) level interfaces to provide full functional, logical, and physical specifications; Identify processes for specifying the lowest level (i.e., subsystem or component) at and below which it intends to control and define interfaces by proprietary or vendor-unique standards and the impact of that upon its proposed logistics approach. Interfaces described shall include, at a minimum, mechanical, electrical (power and signal wiring), software, firmware, and hardware interfaces;
N00030-13-R-0029 Page 11 of 102

The Contractor shall:

ˇ ˇ

Identify the interface and data exchange standards between the system and other data sources; Consider using these interfaces to support an overall information assurance strategy that implements Information Assurance (IA) Processes in accordance with DoD Instruction 8500.2 (dated February 6, 2003); If applicable, select external interfaces from existing open or Government standards with an emphasis on enterprise-level interoperability. The Contractor shall describe how its selection of interfaces shall maximize the ability of the system to easily accommodate technology insertion (both hardware and software) and facilitate the insertion of alternative or reusable modular system elements; Describe the extent that the change or configuration management process proposed shall use "community of interest" teams in an integrated team approach to effectively identify how individual changes impact the system's internal or external interfaces and information exchange standards. Treatment of Proprietary or Vendor-Unique Elements

ˇ

ˇ

1.7.9

The Contractor shall explain the use of proprietary, vendor-unique or closed components or interfaces. The contractor shall define its process for identifying and justifying proprietary, vendor-unique or closed interfaces, code modules, hardware, firmware, or software to be used. When interfaces, hardware, firmware, or modules that are proprietary or vendor-unique are required, the contractor shall demonstrate to the Government that those proprietary elements do not preclude or hinder other component or module developers from interfacing with or otherwise developing, replacing, or upgrading open parts of the system. 1.7.10 Open Business Practices The Contractor shall demonstrate that the modularity of the system design promotes the identification of multiple sources of supply and/or repair, and supports flexible business strategies that enhance subcontractor competition. The contractor shall conduct a market survey to identify candidate COTS, proprietary, open source software (OSS) and other reusable NDI capable of achieving the performance requirements of solutions that it proposes to custom build. The survey results shall be provided to support each major review. COTS and other reusable NDI selection criteria shall address the following factors, at a minimum: Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD) immunity; Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMI/EMC); Integrated Logistics Support requirements; safety; reliability consistent with the environment described in the System Specification; maintainability; subsystem performance trade-offs; power, cooling, and physical form factors; open system architecture break out compatibility; cost; manufacturer's quality assurance provisions; market acceptability; obsolescence; adequacy of available intellectual property including technical data, computer software and re-procurement data rights on the product; and merits of the software supported by the product. Decisions leading to the selection of specific COTS, NDI, proprietary or OSS products shall be supported by appropriate analysis (e.g., with test results, architectural suitability, "best value" assessments, etc.). 1.7.11 Reuse of Pre-existing or Common Items

N00030-13-R-0029 Page 12 of 102

The contractor shall reuse pre-existing or common items unless a determination is made to not reuse and the Government accepts the determination. Exceptions to reuse of pre-existing items must be accompanied by justification, such as cost (both of adoption and life cycle support), schedule, functional and non-functional performance, etc. The general objective of these efforts shall be the development of a common system and/or common elements or components which meet the performance requirements of the various DoD or Service platform missions, where commonality offers the greatest technical and cost benefits. 1.7.12 Third-Party Development The Contractor shall address how it shall provide to the Government information needed to support third-party development and delivery of competitive alternatives of designs for software or other components or modules on an ongoing basis. The contractor shall provide a list of those proprietary, vendor-unique elements that it requests be exempt from this review. 1.7.13 Life Cycle Management and Open Systems The Contractor's architecture shall provide for insertion of COTS into the system and demonstrate that COTS, reusable NDI, and other components are logistically supported throughout the life cycle. The contractor shall describe and demonstrate the strategy for reducing product or system and associated supportability costs through insertion of COTS and other reusable COTS or NDI products. The contractor shall establish a process to logistically support COTS or NDI products.

1.8 Software Engineering Approach 1.8.1 Software Engineering The Contractor shall define a software development approach appropriate for the computer software effort to be performed under this solicitation. This approach shall be documented in a Software Development Plan (SDP) (CDRL A015). The contractor shall follow this SDP for all computer software to be developed or maintained under this effort. The SDP shall define the Offeror's proposed life cycle model and the processes used as a part of that model. In this context, the term "life cycle model" is as defined in IEEE/EIA Std. 12207.0. The SDP shall describe the overall life cycle and shall include primary, supporting, and organizational processes based on the work content of this SOW. In accordance with the framework defined in IEEE/EIA Std. 12207.0, the SDP shall define the processes, the activities to be performed as a part of the processes, the tasks which support the activities, and the techniques and tools to be used to perform the tasks. Because IEEE/EIA Std. 12207 does not prescribe how to accomplish this task, the Offeror shall provide this detailed information so the Government can assess whether the Offeror's approach is viable. The SDP shall contain the information defined by IEEE/EIA Std. 12207.1, section 5.2.1 (generic content) and the Plans or Procedures in Table 1 of IEEE/EIA Std. 12207.1. In all cases, the level of detail shall be sufficient to define all software development processes, activities, and tasks to be conducted. Information provided must include, at a minimum, specific standards, methods, tools, actions, strategies, and responsibilities associated with development and qualification. The Contractor shall provide a Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) (CDRL A016) which will provide a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed, and shall enlist all necessary requirements that are required for the project development; a Software Design Description (SDD) (CDRL A017) to specify the system architecture; and a Requirements Traceability Verification Matrix (RTVM) (CDRL A018). The Contractor shall provide a Software Installation Plan (SIP) (CDRL A019) for installing software at both SWFLANT and SWFPAC; and a Software Transition Plan (STrP) (CDRL A020) that shall identify the resources needed for life cycle support of deliverable software and describe the developer's plans for transitioning deliverable items to SWFLANT and SWFPAC 1.8.2 Software Code Walkthroughs The Contractor shall conduct periodic code walkthroughs during the development Phase. Senior technical personnel from the development team shall review the code and unit test plans that have been developed for a Technical Design Specification (TDS). The purpose of the review is to identify that the code adheres to the program's development standards, is technically sound, meets the design articulated in the related TDS, and that the unit test plan for the code under review is documented in accordance with QA/Test standards as defined. The Government reserves the right to have one or more representatives, on a not-to-interfere basis, observe any and all code walkthroughs and create a detailed report. 1.8.3 Data Management and the Integrated Digital Environment (IDE) The Contractor shall establish and maintain a data management program, as well as a secure Integrated Data Environment (IDE) for hosting all technical data and computer software used or
N00030-13-R-0029 Page 14 of 102

produced in the performance of this contract. Program management information such as cost, risk and schedule data can also be hosted in the IDE. The purpose of the IDE is to create a seamless, collaborative data environment for the Contractor and Government team, which contains all pertinent data about the project throughout its development and delivery. This data management program, including IDE structure, format, processes, and procedures, shall be documented as part of the contract Program Management Plan. The Contractor shall provide the Government team access to and the ability to download and use all data posted to the IDE, whether or not listed in a CDRL. For all data posted to the IDE (whether or not listed in a CDRL), the Government team's rights to use shall be defined by the DFARS clauses and prescriptive sections. All items posted to the IDE, including drafts of deliverables that are not final versions, shall be considered delivered for purposes of the DFARS data rights clauses (and subject to the same rights asserted for final deliveries). However, these non-final versions shall not constitute acceptance for purposes of Inspection and Acceptance requirements or the DFARS data rights clauses. The DAL shall contain the list of all data developed or used in the performance of work under this contract. Deliveries of data, in addition to the IDE, shall be as indicated in the CDRL attachment; delivery and subsequent distribution of technical data and computer software may be in storage media other than paper, including direct electronic exchange of data between two computers. The DAL shall be updated via a delivered data item each month, provided as an attachment to the Monthly Status and Progress Report, which shows the data added each month (incremental reporting). The procedures must provide for the identification of any portions of the data provided with restrictive legends. The acceptance criteria must be consistent with the authorized delivery format. Data (technical data and computer software) shall be protected in accordance with the appropriate Program Protection Plans and Information Assurance guidelines. The Government reserves the right to witness all contractor efforts to accomplish the Statement of Work (SOW) requirements and maintains the right to comment on processes. The Contractor who operates and maintains the IDE shall indemnify the Government from any liability to data owners or licensors resulting from, or as a consequence of, a release or disclosure of technical data and computer software made by this IDE contractor or its officers, employees, agents, or representatives. All computer software and technical data developed or used in the performance of work under this Contract in whole or in part with Government funds and posted to the IDE shall be delivered with at least Government Purpose Rights, as defined in DFARS clauses 252.227.7013, -7014, and -7017 and appropriately marked as such unless a waiver has been submitted and approved by the Government. In this context, technical data and computer software developed or used in the performance of work under this contract do not include embedded open source software or COTS software products which must be identified to the government and the respective licenses provided. A scan report verifying the appropriate markings, including distribution statement, copyright statements, open source software, security classification and data rights shall be delivered with the data. In addition, structural and descriptive metadata shall be provided with all final computer software and technical data. The Contractor shall comply with the requirements of the DD 254 for implementation of the IDE and to ensure proper safeguarding of classified materials, events and processes. This shall

If the parties of this contract are also the parties of a gaining contract-­ (a) the gaining contract shall be modified to identify the transferred RM; (b) the transfer of RM shall not affect the contract amounts of the gaining contract, if the parties negotiated the gaining contract in contemplation of such RM being furnished by the Government; and (c) the transfer of RM shall result in a downward equitable adjustment of one or more of the contract amounts of the gaining contract, if the parties negotiated the gaining contract without contemplation of such RM being furnished by the Government. 8. The Contractor shall maintain auditable records of inventories and transfers of RM. The Contractor shall conduct a physical inventory at contract completion unless waived in accordance with applicable regulations. Acquisition Requirements (March 2010), SSP 5252.252-9750 1.

SECTION M ­ EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M-1 INSTRUCTIONS, APPROACH AND MANDATORY REQUIREMENT M-1.1 Instructions. The offeror should read the provision "Instructions to Offers ­ Competitive Acquisition," FAR 52.215-1, in Section L of this solicitation. This provision states in part that "[t]he Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and sub-factors in the solicitation," and that" [t]he Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a))." The Government's award decision will take into account the requirements and factors described in this Section M. In the paragraphs below, "contract work" means the work described in the statement of work of this solicitation. M-1.2 Approach. The Government anticipates it will award one contract under this solicitation. The Government's award decision may result in award to other than the lowest-cost offeror or to other than the offeror whose proposal is highest-rated under the non-cost evaluation factors. M-1.3 Mandatory Requirement. To be eligible for award, an offeror must meet the following mandatory requirement at the time of contract award: All personnel which the offeror proposes to perform the contract work must have a SECRET clearance at the time of contract award. M-2 EVALUATION FACTORS M-2.1 Evaluation Factors and Relative Importance. The Government will evaluate proposals using the following evaluation factors: The non-Cost evaluation factors are (1) Personnel; (2) Technical Approach; (3) Management Approach; (4) Delivery Schedule; and (5) Past Performance. Cost will also be evaluated. All evaluation factors other than the Cost/Price factor, when combined, are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Factors 1 and 2 are considered the most important factors and are approximately equal in importance. Factors 3 and 4 are approximately equal in importance, and are considered less important than Factors 1 and 2, but more important than Factor 5. Factor 5 is considered less important than Factors 1, 2, 3 and 4. Any sub-factors are listed within each factor in descending order of importance. If competing proposals are determined essentially equal in terms of non-price factors, the Government may determine that the best value decision is the lowest priced offer. The Government may make tradeoffs between Factors 1 through 5 and price when determining which
N00030-13-R-0029 Page 99 of 102

offer constitutes the best value to the Government. This tradeoff process may result in an award to other than the low priced offer or other than the proposal with the highest non-price factor rating. The technical evaluation factors and subfactors and the Past Performance Factor are described below. M-2.2 Non-Cost Evaluation Factor 1 ­ Personnel The Government will evaluate each offeror's proposal under the following factors / subfactors: (a) Quality of key personnel's education, experience, and technical expertise in each of the areas referenced in solicitation, and their experience with DoD Programs and assignments that demonstrate involvement in work similar to the proposed contract work. (b) Extent to which the offeror has demonstrated previous experience in developing software of the same nature as that being acquired with this solicitation and the extent to which personnel who contributed to these previous efforts will be supporting the contract work. (c) Extent to which the offeror has demonstrated previous experience in developing software using the same or similar processes and approaches as proposed for this solicitation. The results of any standard model-based process maturity appraisals performed within 24 months prior to proposal submission, and the number of proposed staff experienced in using these processes will be part of the evaluation criteria.

M-2.3 Non-Cost Evaluation Factor 2 ­ Technical Approach The Government will assess the offeror's proposal in the following areas: (a) Extent to which technical proposal ensures compliance with the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and requirements listed in the Requirements Document RD for Security Forces Qualification and Certification Management Tool, version: 1.0. (b) Extent to which the offeror understands development and deployment of a system in a DoD environment. (c) Evaluation of the proposed high level system architecture detailing functional components including COTS tools, developed components, software languages and discrete tool sets. (d) Extent to which the offeror has the ability to support the product post-delivery in a sustainment capacity. (e) Level of maturity of system development and integration processes and how the proposed processes are equivalent to those articulated by CMMI capability level 3. If software development is proposed the technical approach must include the proposed software development process.

N00030-13-R-0029 Page 100 of 102

(f) Extent to which the offeror's proposed draft Software Development Plan (SDP) approach is appropriate for the system to be developed in the Statement of Work which meets standard levels of completeness and process quality. For this evaluation, the Government will rely primarily on the draft SDP and the SDP rational. Criteria: IEEE/EIA Std 122207.1, Section 4.2.3, H.3 ­ Characteristics of Life Cycle Data M-2.4 Non-Cost Evaluation Factor 3 ­ Management Approach The Government will assess the offeror's Program Management Approach to determine the extent that the offeror demonstrates a thorough understanding of, and capability to successfully accomplish the requirements of this solicitation, and the delivery schedule. Evaluation will consider the offeror's: (a) Extent to which the management structure for managing contract work including organizational structure, systems engineering, risk management, lines of authority, lines of communication, and management of subcontractor efforts supports the SOW; (b) Extent to which the offeror describes how they will mitigate problems as they arise; (c) Extent to which the proposed method for team coordination includes coordination of in-house Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) as well as the coordination and interaction with SSP, SSP consultants and Contractors, test agencies, subcontractors, and outside agencies; M-2.5 Non-Cost Evaluation Factor 4 ­ Delivery Schedule The Government will assess the offeror's proposed delivery schedule to determine reasonableness of the schedule, while delivering a quality product. M-2.6 Non-Cost Evaluation Factor 5 ­ Past Performance Based on the offeror's past performance record, the Government will assess the level of confidence that the Government has in the offeror's ability to successfully perform the required effort. An offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will be assigned a neutral rating. M-3 EVALUATION APPROACHES M-3.1 Approach for Evaluation Under the Cost Factor. With respect to the Cost factor, the Government will perform a price analysis, cost analysis, and/or cost realism analysis on the offeror's proposed contract amounts. As a result of the analysis, the Government may adjust the proposed amounts for evaluation purposes. M-3.2 Approach for Evaluation Under the Past Performance Factor. With respect to the Past Performance factor, the Government will assign a rating to the offeror's proposal that reflects a judgment relating to the Government's level of confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
