                                           NOTIFICATION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS


Background

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors,
established a policy for all Federal agencies to create and use a government-wide secure and reliable form of identification for their Federal
employees and contractors. This policy is intended to ensure a more complete, reliable, and trusted identification of individuals and for
controlling the access of Federal employees and contractors to Federal physical facilities and information systems.

This notification is issued to applicants for employee and certain contractor positions with the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) to describe the
personal identity verification policies of this agency.


Applicant Identification Responsibilities

As an applicant for a position as an employee or contractor with the RRB, you are required to do the following in order to complete your
application process:
    • Appear in person before the appropriate RRB official and present two forms of identity source documents to prove your claimed identity.
      The identity source documents must be in original form and come from the list of acceptable documents shown below. At least one document
      shall be a valid State or Federal government issued picture identification (ID).
    • Complete and bring with you the enclosed Standard Form (SF) 85, OPM Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, or an equivalent form to
      provide the required background information; so that a background check can be completed, unless one was previously done, remains on file,
      and can be referenced. (For additional copies of this form go to http://www.opm.gov/forms.)
    • Submit to having your picture and fingerprints taken.

Once a background check has been completed, and no derogatory information is developed, you will be required to:
    • Appear in person to the authorized RRB official to collect your PIV (Personal Identity Verification) Card. At that time, you will again be
      required to present a state or Federal government picture identity source document to verify that you are the same individual as the one
      who applied for the employee or contractor position and submitted the identity information required under this policy.
    • Accept the PIV Card by signing for the card and acknowledging the related responsibilities.


Responsibilities of Holding a PIV Card

When you are issued a PIV Card, you have the following responsibilities regarding its care and protection. You will be asked to sign a statement
acknowledging your responsibilities. Some of the important responsibilities are:


    • You are required to protect your PIV Card from loss or theft. However, in the event that your card is lost or stolen, you must report the
      loss within 24 hours of noting its disappearance.
    • You agree that you will not attempt to clone, modify, or obtain data from any PIV Card.
    • You agree that you will not assist others in gaining unauthorized access to Federal facilities or information.


Protection of Applicant Information

The following information provided by you will be used as part of the process of identity proofing, registration/enrollment, conducting a
background investigation, and issuance of a PIV Card:
    • Applicant’s full name;
    • Date and place of birth;
    • Identity source documents; and
    • Other relevant information useful for proving the claimed identity of the applicant.

This information will be stored in secure electronic media or in locked files. Access to the records is limited to those individuals who have a
need to know the information in order to perform official functions under the PIV issuance process.


Notification of Results of Identity Proofing

If, as a result of the identity proofing process, you are deemed ineligible to be appointed to the position for which you applied and to be
issued an official RRB identity document, you will be notified in writing of the identity proofing results. You will also be notified at that
time of any additional rights you have under the RRB’s identity proofing processes.


Rights If PIV Card Is Not Approved for You

If you are denied a PIV Card, you have the right to appeal that decision Your appeal should start with a request to the Director of Human
Resources to review your case. [Note: If the position/contract you seek is in the Office of Inspector General (OIG), you should appeal to the
Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG.] Your request must be made within five workdays of receiving notification of the
denial, and should specify the basis for your belief that the decision to deny you a PIV Card was incorrect. If you are not satisfied with the
decision at this stage, you may make a further appeal to the Director of Administration [or the Inspector General in the case of a
position/contract in the OIG] within five workdays of receiving the decision at the initial stage of the appeal.


Correcting Incorrect Information

You have the right to present evidence to correct any information that you believe to be incorrect that is obtained about you as a result of the
PIV Card identity proofing, registration/enrollment, and issuance. Such evidence should be presented to the Director of Human Resources [or the
Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG for a position/contract in the OIG] as soon as you become aware of a decision being
made about you based on the incorrect information. A PIV Applicant Representative is available to assist you in removing incorrect


information from your records. The name of your PIV Applicant Representative is Pamela Martin-Tate. She can be reached at telephone number 312-
751-4943.

Privacy Rights
The information collected during the PIV process may be disclosed in accordance with the Railroad Retirement Board’s published routine uses as
stated in System of Records RRB-46 and RRB-48 and as otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a), including disclosure:
to the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Labor
Relations Authority upon an authorized request; to agencies, contractors, and others to administer personnel and payroll systems, for debt
collection and for employment or security investigations; to law enforcement agencies if the Railroad Retirement Board becomes aware of a
possible violation of a law or regulation; to a Congressional office in response to requests made on your behalf; to the Department of Justice,
courts, and counsel during litigation; to unions if needed to perform their authorized duties; to other agencies under approved computer
matches; and as otherwise authorized by law or regulations.


Violations of Privacy

Any person who knowing and willfully discloses information in violation of the Privacy Act is subject to civil, criminal and/or administrative
penalties.

Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or
offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  “SUBCONTRACT,” as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-
employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor requesting supplies or services required for
performance of the contract or subcontract.

If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the RRB Acquisition Staff at 312-751-4535.

RRB current subcontracting goal is 23% for small business, including 8(a) Program Participants (hereafter referred to as SB), 5.00% for Small
Disadvantaged Business, including Alaska Native Corporations (ANC) and Indian Tribes (hereafter referred to as SDB), 5.00% for women-owned
business and economically disadvantaged women-owned business (hereafter referred to as WOSB), 3.00% HubZone business (HUBZone) and 3.00% service
disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for Fiscal Year (FY) 2013.  For this procurement, RRB expects all proposed
subcontracting plans to contain at a minimum the aforementioned percentages.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total
estimated subcontracting dollars.  Zero goal statement removed.

   1. Type of Plan (check one)


      _____ Individual plan (all elements developed specifically for this contract and applicable for the full term of this contract).


      _____ Master plan (goals developed for this contract) all other elements standardized and approved by a lead agency Federal Official; must
      be renewed every three years and contractor must provide copy of lead agency approval.


      _____ Commercial products/service plan (goals are negotiated with the initial agency on a company-wide basis rather than for individual

8.  Timely Payments to Subcontractors

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your
subcontracts with small business concerns, 8(a), SDB, women-owned small business, HubZone and service disabled veteran-owned small business
concerns.

Your company has established and used such procedures:  _____ yes _____ no


9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, 8(a), small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone small and service disabled veteran owned concerns as
subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make
a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that
liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, SDB,
WOSB, HubZone and SDVOSB small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with
the contracting official prior to approval of the plan.

III.  Statement of Work


        Overview


        The RRB currently has 83,850 pages of paper-based legal opinions dating back to 1935 for which there is no  electronic  equivalent.  The
        paper-based legal opinions were issued prior to 1997. Individual legal opinions vary in length from 1 to 200 pages,  with  approximately
        480 words per page. The documents contain  Personal  Identifiable  Information  (PII)  (e.g.  proper  names,  social  security  numbers,
        addresses, etc).






        The documents prior to 1942 are on acid paper, 1942-1978, the documents are on onion-skin paper and after  1978,  the  documents  are  on
        photocopy paper, with varying degrees of clarity. The documents are organized into 258, loose-leaf, 3-ring binders. Binders from 1993  to
        2010 have a table of contents and a digest card listing included in the binders. Each legal opinion is identified by a six-character date-
        based code, e.g. L-2013-01. Prior to May 17, 1999, the identifier was stamped on the documents. Subsequent to August 6, 1999, identifiers
        were typed into the documents. The legal opinions that were issued after 1996 are available for viewing  through  the  Agency’s  website:
        www.rrb.gov. To go to the direct link: http://www.rrb.gov/blaw/digestcards.asp.





        The Agency utilizes Microsoft Word (Office 2007 version or later) as its word processing  standard;  Microsoft.Net  as  its  application
        standard; and Microsoft SQL as its database standard.



            B.  Required Services


        1.       Digitization and Indexing Services
           The  contractor  will  be  required  to  scan  and  digitize  all  of  the  paper-based  legal  opinions   with   Optical   Character
           Recognition/Intelligent Character Recognition (OCR/ICR) technology and save the legal  opinions  in  an  electronic  searchable  file
           format. The RRB requires both an imaged copy and a redacted text file of each of the legal opinion documents. The  imaged  copies  of
           the legal opinion files shall be sent to the RRB on CD/DVDs at the end of each month of services via a secure shipping method with  a
           tracking number.


           The Contractor must redact PII for the redacted text file of each legal  opinion  document  and  replace  the  PII  with  generalized
           wording, (e.g. “John Smith” is converted to “Person A”, SSN 123-45-6789 is converted to XXX-XX-XXXX). The PII that must  be  redacted
           includes any personal information such as: names, social security numbers, addresses, etc. Exceptions: RRB and other Federal Employee
           public information (Name and job title only) should not be redacted, all other should be redacted. Referenced  case  files  or  prior
           legal opinions must include a URL link to the publically available case file or legal opinion. The electronic redacted text files  in
           a “read only” format shall be stored and hosted on the contractor’s database repository and shall be accessible by RRB staff and  the
           public via a link from RRB’s website to the contractor’s hosted data repository site.

           The Contractor shall index the electronic redacted text legal opinion files according to the following fields:
               – Subject
               – Legal Opinion Number
               – Date of Legal Opinion


        2.       Hosting Services
                 The contractor shall provide the information technology (IT) infrastructure
           required to host and maintain a database repository solution for the redacted text electronic legal opinion  files  described  above.
           Hosting services includes but is not limited to the maintenance and operation of the hardware,  data  center  support,  software  and
           telecommunications support for the database repository solution.


           The contractor’s solution must meet the following hosting objectives:


            a. Provide all hardware, software, and infrastructure needed to host the proposed database repository solution.
            b. Provide a complete hosting solution in compliance with FISMA (i.e. perform Risk Assessment, Developer System  Security  Plan,  and
               provide provisional Authorization to Operate) requirements.
            c. In accordance with the directions and authorization of the RRB contracting officer, ensure that a proper Continuity of  Operations
               plan is in place.
            d. Establish and maintain application security and access controls as required the RRB Chief Information Security Officer[1].
            e. Prepare and execute service level agreement that includes the performance indicators. Detailed technical and service level
               agreement requirements are in Attachment 1.

        The Contractor shall store redacted text versions of the legal opinions in their data repository solution. The redacted versions of  the
        legal opinions are to be viewable by the public only through the Agency’s website: www.rrb.gov. The Contractor’s hosted-service solution
        must have the capability to add new legal opinions to the solution on a quarterly basis after the  implementation  period  is  concluded
        (also see III.D. below). The contractor shall make the hosted documents searchable and retrievable to view and print, based  on  a  user
        search by opinion date, legal opinion number and word search of any words/text or strings of words/text in both the  subject  field  and
        the redacted document body of text.


        The hosted legal opinion files should be accessible on a 24/7 basis except for scheduled maintenance  down-time.  Maintenance  down-time
        should be posted on web-site no later than 3 days prior with date and timeframe of down-time.


        The Contractor must provide the RRB an “exit strategy”, whereby the contractor shall provide the hosted documents to the RRB or an  RRB-
        designated third party contractor, in the event the RRB needs to move the data and/or change providers, such as but not limited  to  the
        end of the contract terms planned for with this contract.

      C.  Optional Digitization Services

            1.  Index/Digest Cards
           The RRB currently has 53,751 legal opinion file index cards. The cards are 3”x5”, filed alphabetically according to subject, and they
           are either typed or handwritten. There are a number of double-sided (print on both sides), and some are “cross reference” cards.  The
           Contractor, upon completion of the legal opinion file Digitization and Indexing Services listed above and subject to available funds,
           shall digitize all of the legal opinion file  index  cards  with  Optical  Character  Recognition/Intelligent  Character  Recognition
           (OCR/ICR) technology and save the index cards in an electronic searchable file format. The imaged copies of the index cards shall  be
           sent to the RRB on CD/DVDs at the end of each month of services via a secure shipping method with a tracking number.

      D.  Optional Quarterly Digitization and Indexing Update Services
        The RRB requires the contractor to provide services quarterly, upon the completion of the legal opinion file digitization  and  indexing
        services listed above, to update the data repository by digitizing,  redacting  and  indexing  new  legal  opinion  documents.  The  RRB
        estimates that the average number of legal opinions to be added to the data repository each quarter will be an approximate prorate share
        of an estimated 25 to 30 new legal opinions annually.

      E.  Location of and Procedures for Digitization Services
        The RRB would prefer that the digitization services take place at the Agency’s Headquarters in Chicago. If the services are provided on-
        site, each binder cannot be out of the RRB’s span of control for no more than one (1) business day. Each binder will need to  be  signed
        for upon removal from the OGC and upon return to the OGC. If any legal opinions are missing from a binder for whatever reason, it should
        be brought to the attention of the project manager upon discovery by the contractor project staff. After the document is  digitized,  it
        is to be placed in the same order/binder as it was originally found (this will include removing and re-stapling of each document).


        If the digitization services are performed off-site, each binder cannot be out of the RRB’s span of control for  no  more  than  fifteen
        (15) business days. The Contractor shall be responsible for the secure shipment of the binders from and to the RRB. Again,  each  binder
        will need to be signed for by the contractor upon removal from the OGC and upon return to the OGC. If any legal opinion is missing  from
        a binder for whatever reason, the contractor shall notify the RRB project manager upon discovery by the contractor project staff.  After
        the document is digitized, it is to be placed in the same order/binder as it was originally found (this will include  removing  and  re-
        stapling of each document).


      F.   Security Requirements
         The offeror shall comply with the information technology security requirements in the Federal Information Security Management Act, the
         related National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) FISMA implementation guidance, including but not limited to NIST 800-37
         Rev. 1, NIST 800-53 Rev. 4 and NIST 800-53A, and OMB memoranda on privacy and security. The proposal shall include a list of proposed
         staff for these services that have successfully met requirements in the Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), OMB

         other Federal Government Agencies. Additional security provisions are provided in the Clauses and Provisions Section of the RFQ.


         The proposed solution is required to meet all security controls for a FISMA moderate system as defined by NIST 800-53 Rev 4, regardless
         of whether or not each requirement is specified in this solicitation. The offeror shall comply with NIST 800-53 Rev. 4, including, but
         not limited to, indicating compliance with the requirement for use of multifactor authentication [2] for network access to privileged
         accounts (Organizational Users IA-2(2)). RRB requires at minimum two factor authentication. In

      G.  Period of Performance
        The Initial Legal Opinion File Digitization and Indexing Services requested shall be performed in 5 phases over a period of time.  Phase
        1 digitization and indexing services shall include approximately 37 binders, with the legal opinions on various paper types (acid, onion
        skin, and photocopier) as well as 371 legal opinion documents in Microsoft Word or PDF format. Phases 2 will include 56 binders, Phase 3
        will include 50 binders, Phase 4 will include 48 binders, and Phase 5 will include 50 binders of legal opinions with the legal  opinions
        on various paper types as listed above for Phase 1.


        The RRB will issue a contract or agreement for the services with Phase 1 legal opinion digitization and indexing  services  and  hosting
        services, at a minimum, guaranteed. The RRB may exercise the remaining Optional Phases 2-5 legal opinion file digitization and  indexing
        services and hosting services based on funds availability and also the successful completion of the Phase 1 services by the  contractor.
        The RRB also may exercise, subject to availability of funds and the successful completion of Phases 1-5 services, the Optional Quarterly
        Digitization and Indexing Update Services and the Optional Digitization Services described above.

Evaluation and Award

      A. The following clause shall be incorporated by reference:


        FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation- Commercial Items (JAN 1999)


        Proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation instructions.  Proposals, which are so deficient in this
        area, as to not warrant further consideration, will be considered nonresponsive and will be rejected. The RRB will notify the offeror as
        soon as possible. To be considered responsive, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified in Section V. Proposal
        Submission Instructions. Offerors whose proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at the RRB’s discretion, to
        remedy the deficiency by submitting additional clarifying or supplemental information.


      B. Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response. Accordingly, the  objective  of  this
        evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work and the required proposal
        format and content, Section V. Proposal Submission Instructions.

      C. The Government will evaluate the proposals received and award a contract or order to the responsible offeror whose offer  conforming  to
        the solicitation is the best value to the government with price and technical factors listed below considered.


            The relationship of the evaluated technical  factor  (Project  Management  Approach,  Qualifications  of  Proposed  Staff,  and  Past
        Performance) to price will be 2:1. Following the evaluation of proposals, the RRB will select the proposal providing the  best  value  to
        the RRB.






            1.    Technical Evaluation

           Calculation of the technical score (200 possible points) will be accomplished  by  adding  the  points  awarded  for  each  technical
           evaluation factor listed below in descending order of importance:


           a.  Project Approach and Management Plan (100 possible points)
                  The RRB will evaluate offerors project management approach as
                  detailed in their project plan, staffing plan, quality control as required in
                  section V.C.1 for those plans demonstrated success in accomplishing
             probability to successfully accomplish the objectives and performance requirements in section III.  RRB shall assign extra value
             points to an offeror  who plans and is capable of providing the document digitization services on-site.


           b.  Experience, Qualifications, and Expertise of Proposed Staff ( 60 possible points)
                The RRB will evaluate the number of years of experience the proposed
                staff have in performing digitized services in an environment similar to
                the RRB’s and the relevant degrees and professional credentials/certifications of the proposed staff. This information should
                have been presented by the offeror in response to Section V.C.2.


           c.  Past Performance (40 possible points)
              The RRB will evaluate the contractor’s capability to perform the required services as indicated by: the direct applicability of the
              references, customer satisfaction, quality of service, reliability and timeliness of performance of services within  project  plans
              and budgets. This information should have been presented by the offeror in response to Section V.C.3.


        2.  Price Evaluation

           Calculation of the price score (100 possible points) for each offer will be computed by multiplying the maximum point score available
           by a fraction representing the ratio of the lowest total evaluated price of all technically acceptable offers received by  the  Board
           to the total evaluated price of the offer being evaluated.


           The total evaluated price is calculated by adding the sum of all fixed price per job or lot CLINS plus the sum of the annual extended
           amounts for fixed price per month CLINS including options for the initial year and six option years.

      D.  The RRB may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices
            are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate
            the RRB to exercise the option(s).

      E.   The RRB intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offers received,
         without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms  from  a  price  and  technical  standpoint.
         However, the RRB may determine to conduct discussions, and in that case will do  so  with  those  offerors  determined  to  be  in  the
         competitive range.


      F. The RRB anticipates awarding a single contract for the initial year of digitization and hosting services and six  (6)  one  year  option
         periods for hosting and quarterly digitization update services.

      G.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to  the  successful  offeror  within  the  time  for
         acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further  action  by  either  party.  Before  the  offer's
         specified expiration time, the RRB may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its  receipt,
         unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
