An independent contractor is not a marketing consultant when rendering-- (1) Services excluded in FAR Subpart 37.2; (2) Routine engineering and technical services (such as installation, operation, or maintenance of systems, equipment, software, components, or facilities); (3) Routine legal, actuarial, auditing, and accounting services; and (4) Training services. (b) In accordance with the guidance in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer has determined that potentially significant organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) could result if the Contractor is allowed to participate (at any level) in future Federal Government acquisitions that include requirements that may be established or affected by the performance of the Statement of Work (SOW) by the Contractor under this Contract. (c) It is understood and agreed that the Contractor may be ineligible (unless expressly exempted as provided in FAR Part 9.5) to act as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or consultant or subcontractor to any prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier, for any future requirements (for services, systems, or components of systems) procured by any Federal Government activity where the Contractor, in performance of the SOW under this Contract, has provided or is providing support (as described in FAR 9.505-1 through 9.505-4) that establishes or affects future requirements or may affect the future competition.

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 26 (d) The contracting officer responsible for securing future requirements, in his/her sole discretion, may make a determination to exempt the Contractor from ineligibility as described in subparagraph (c) above provided the Contractor submits an acceptable mitigation plan. (1) Items for consideration in a mitigation plan include the following: identification of the organizational conflict(s) of interest; a reporting and tracking system; an organizational conflict of interest compliance/enforcement plan, to include employee training and sanctions, in the event of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information; a plan for organizational segregation (e.g., separate reporting chains); data security measures; and, non-disclosure agreements. (2) The Government's determination regarding the adequacy of the mitigation plan or the possibility of mitigation is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Government and is not subject to the Disputes clause of the contract. The Government may terminate the contract for default if the Contractor fails to implement and follow the procedures contained in any approved mitigation plan. (3) Nothing contained herein shall preclude the contracting officer in future Federal Government acquisitions from making his/her own determination as to whether an OCI exists and whether any such OCI has been successfully mitigated. (e) The Contractor shall apply this clause to any subcontractors or consultants who: have access to proprietary information received or generated in the performance of this Contract; and/or, who participate in the development of data, or participate in any other activity related to this Contract which is subject to the terms of this clause at the prime contractor level. (g) The Contactor agrees that it and its subcontractors at all levels shall use reasonable diligence in protecting proprietary data/information that is received or generated in performance of this Contract in accordance with this clause and any other clause of this Contract pertaining to the nondisclosure of information. The Contractor further agrees that neither it nor its subcontractors will willfully disclose proprietary data/information that is received or generated in the performance of this Contract without the prior permission of the Contracting Officer, and that proprietary information shall not be duplicated, used or disclosed, in whole or part, for any purpose other than to accomplish the work required by the Contract. (f) The Contractor and its Subcontractors at all levels shall inform their employees that they are required to comply with the applicable requirements and restrictions contained in: restrictive markings applicable to data/information that they receive or generate in the performance of this Contract; FAR Subpart 9.5 pertaining to actual or potential OCIs; FAR 3.104 pertaining to requirements and restrictions under the Procurement Integrity Act; and, Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) 252.2047000 pertaining to "Disclosure of Information." (h) The Contractor agrees to enter into written agreements with all companies whose proprietary data it shall have access to and to protect such data from unauthorized use or disclosure as long as it remains proprietary. The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer copies of these written agreements. The Contractor agrees to protect the proprietary data and rights of other organizations disclosed to the Contractor during performance of this Contract with the same caution that a reasonably prudent Contractor would use to safeguard its own highly valuable property. The

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 27 Contractor agrees to refrain from using proprietary information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. (i) The Contractor shall not distribute reports, data or information of any nature received or arising from its performance under this Contract, except as provided by this Contract or as may be directed by the Contracting Officer. (j) The Contractor agrees that if in the performance of this Contract it discovers a potential OCI, a prompt and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of the actions the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflicts. H-8 SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENT REGARDING NON-DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION Data includes all data, information and software, regardless of the medium (e.g. electronic or paper) and/or format in which the data exists, and includes data which is derived from, based on, incorporates, includes or refers to such data. In the course of performing this Contract, the Contractor may be or may have been given access to: Source Selection Information [as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.104]; data that has been assigned (or data that is generated by the Contractor that should be assigned) a contractually required or other Government distribution control (such as a Distribution Statement prescribed in DoD Directive 5230.24); and/or data that has been given a restrictive legend by the source of the data such as "business sensitive," "proprietary," "confidential," or word(s) with similar meaning that impose limits on the use and distribution of the data (see for example FAR 52.215-1(e)). All such data with limitations on use and distribution are collectively referred to herein as "protected data." This Special Contract Requirement supplements and implements Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) 252.204-7000, "DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION." As a condition to receiving access to protected data, the Contractor shall: (1) prior to having access to protected data, obtain the agreement of the source of the protected data to permit access by the Contractor to such protected data; (2) use the protected data solely for the purpose of performing duties under this Contract unless otherwise permitted by the source of the protected data; (3) not disclose, release, reproduce or otherwise provide or make available the protected data, or any portion thereof, to any employee of the Contractor unless and until such employee has been informed of the restrictions on use and distribution of the protected data and agreed in writing to conform with the applicable restrictions; (4) not disclose, release, reproduce or otherwise provide or make available the protected data, or any portion thereof, to any non-Government person or entity (including, but not limited to, affiliates, subcontractors, successors and assignees of the Contractor), unless the Contracting Officer and the source of the protected data have given prior written approval (which shall be conditioned upon the person receiving the protected data having been informed of the restrictions on use and distribution of the protected data and having agreed in writing to conform with the applicable restrictions; (5) establish and execute safeguards to prevent the unauthorized use or distribution of protected data. Any unauthorized use, disclosure or release of protected data may result in substantial criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties to the Contractor or to the individual who violates a restriction on use or distribution of protected data. Any agreement with another company regarding access to that company's protected data shall not create any limitation on the Government or its employees with

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 28 regard to such data. A copy of each executed company and individual non-disclosure agreement relating to this Contract shall be provided to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Appropriate restrictive legends will be included by the Contractor on any copies and reproductions made of all or any part of the protected data and any data that is derived from, based upon, incorporates, includes or refers to the protected data. When the Contractor's need for such protected data ends, the protected data shall be returned promptly to the source of the protected data with notice to the COR. However, the obligation not to use, disclose, release, reproduce or otherwise provide or make available such protected data, or any portion thereof, shall continue, even after completion of the Contract, for so long as required by the terms of any agreement pertaining to the protected data between the Contractor and the source of the protected data, or (in the case of Government information) for so long as required by applicable law and regulation. Any actual or suspected unauthorized use, disclosure, release, or reproduction of protected data or violation of this agreement, of which the company or any employee is or may become aware, shall be reported promptly (within one business day after discovery and confirmation) to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). H-9 LEVEL OF EFFORT TASK ORDERS

(a) In the performance of each term form task order issued under this contract, the Contractor agrees to provide the level of effort specified in the task order and in accordance with this provision. (b) It is understood and agreed that the rate of direct labor hours expended each month may fluctuate in pursuit of the technical objective, provided such fluctuation does not result in the use of the total hours of effort prior to the expiration of the term of the task order. The Contractor is required to notify the Contracting Officer when 85% of the total level of effort of the task order has been expended. (c) If, during the term of the task order, the Contractor finds it necessary to accelerate the expenditure of direct labor under the task order to such an extent that the total hours of effort specified would be used prior to the expiration of the term, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing setting forth the acceleration required, the probable benefits which would result, and an offer to undertake the acceleration at no increase in the estimated cost or fixed fee together with an offer setting forth a proposed level of effort, cost breakdown, and proposed fixed-fee for continuation of the work until expiration of the term of the task order. If the maximum amount specified in the contract is not adequate to accommodate the anticipated accelerated expenditure of direct labor, the Contractor shall also include in its offer a proposed increase of the maximum amount, cost breakdown, and proposed fixed-fee for the increase. The offer shall provide that the work proposed will be subject to the terms and conditions of this contract and any additions or changes required by current law, regulations, or directives, and that the offer, with a written notice of acceptance by the Contracting Officer, shall constitute a binding contract. The Contractor shall not accelerate any effort until receipt of such written approval by the Contracting Officer. Any agreement to accelerate will be formalized by modification of the order and, if necessary, the contract.

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 29 (d) The Contracting Officer may, by written order, direct the Contractor to accelerate the expenditure of direct labor under a task order such that the labor hours of effort specified therein would be used prior to the expiration of the term. This order shall specify the acceleration required and the resulting revised term. The Contractor shall acknowledge this order within ten days of receipt. (f) If the total level of effort specified in each task order is not provided by the Contractor during the term of the task order, the Contracting Officer shall either (i) reduce the fixed fee of the task order as follows: Fee Reduction = Fixed Fee x (Required LOE Hours - Expended LOE Hours) Required LOE Hours or (ii) subject to the provisions of the clause of this contract entitled "Limitation of Cost," require the Contractor to continue to perform the work until the total number of hours of direct labor specified in the task order shall have been expended, at no increase in the fixed fee of the task order. (g) In the event the Government fails to fully fund the task order in a timely manner, the term of the task order may be extended accordingly with no change to cost or fee. If the Government fails to fully fund the task order, the fee will be adjusted in direct proportion to that effort which was performed. (h) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the above paragraphs, the Contractor may furnish labor hours up to five percent in excess of the total direct labor hours specified in the task order provided that the additional effort is furnished within the term hereof, and provided further that no increase in the estimated cost or fixed-fee is required, and no adjustment in the fixed-fee shall be made provided that the Contractor has delivered at least 95% of the level of effort specified in the task order. (i) It is understood that the mix of labor categories provided by the Contractor under the task order, as well as the distribution of effort among those categories, may vary considerably from the initial mix and distribution of effort, which was estimated by the Government or proposed by the Contractor. (j) Nothing herein shall be construed to alter or waive any of the rights or obligations of either party pursuant to the Clause entitled "Limitation of Costs" or "Limitation of Funds," either of which incorporated herein applies to each task order under this contract.

L-11 PROPOSAL ORGANIZATION (1) Information for the technical/management proposal shall be placed in Volume I and be completely separate from the business proposal (Volume II). (2) Proposal Format and Length - No attempt is made to restrict the proposal format and style. However, the proposal should be written and organized so as to be compatible with the RFP, the Statement of Work, company's organization and accounting structure, and proposed cost estimate. Offerors are encouraged to use recycled paper and maximize the use of double sided copying when preparing responses to solicitations. L-12 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS Access to classified information is not required to submit a proposal for this statement of work. However, prospective offerors shall have the required facility clearance in accordance with attached DD254 at the time of proposal and personnel available with final DoD granted personnel security clearances required for performance of the contract L-13 POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Pursuant to FAR 9.5 and the definitions provided therein: (a) Definitions Organizational Conflict of Interest: FAR 2.1 defines "Organizational Conflict of Interest" as a situation in which "...because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage." For the purposes of this contract, the term Organizational Conflict of Interest means that a relationship exists between the contractor (including the successor-in-interest,

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 54 assignee or affiliated divisions, subsidiaries, employees, consultants, or subcontractors, hereinafter referred to as "Contractor") and another in which the underlying interests of the contractor and the other party directly or indirectly (1) may influence, affect or diminish the contractor's ability to give impartial, technically sound, objective assistance, conclusions, advie or recommendations, or may otherwise result in a biased work product to or for the Government, or (2) may result in an unfair competitive advantage. (b) Purpose The primary purpose of this clause is to ensure that the Contractor (1) does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract, and (2) is not biased because of its current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract. (c) Description of the Effort This contract is for research and development activities in support of various NRL Programs. In the performance of this contract, the contractor may be required to make certain findings, conclusions and recommendations to the Government. The Contractor may also be required to have access to other Contractor's proprietary data in order to make those findings, conclusions and recommendations to the Government. Because the Government requires total objectivity and impartiality in performance of this contract, the contractor must be free from any biased influences and interests which will impact, directly or indirectly, on the contractor's decision making process. (d) Nature of Conflict Areas of potential conflicts could include, but are not limited to, the following areas as defined in FAR 9.505: 1. 2. 3. 4. Providing systems engineering and technical direction, Preparing specifications or work statements, Providing evaluation services, and Obtaining access to proprietary information.

(e) Disclosure Statement If the Offeror is aware of circumstances that may hinder its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and unbiased assessments, recommendations and/or evaluations; or that circumstances exist that may result in the appearance that it may have any unfair competitive advantage, the offeror shall provide a full disclosure statement. The statement must describe in a concise manner all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed hereunder and bearing on whether the offeror has a possible organizational conflict of interest with respect to (1) impartial, technically sound, and unbiased assessments, recommendations and/or evaluations, or (2) being given an unfair competitive advantage. Prospective Offerors should refer to FAR 9.5 for policies and procedures for avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest. If the Offeror is not aware of any circumstances of this nature, then the Offeror shall provide a statement stating such. The government will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the offeror. All such information and any other relevant information will be used by the government to determine whether an award to the offeror may create an organizational conflict of interest. If found to exist, the Government may (1) impose appropriate conditions which avoid such

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 55 conflict, (2) disqualify the offeror, or (3) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the Government to contract with the offeror by including appropriate conditions mitigating such conflict in the contract awarded. The refusal to provide the disclosure of any additional information as required shall result in disqualification of the offeror for award. The nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest may also result in the disqualification of the offeror for award, or if such nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the Government may terminate the contract for default, recommend that the contractor be disqualified from subsequent related contracts, or be subject to such other remedial actions as may be permitted or provided by law. The attention of the offeror in complying with this provision is directed to 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 31 U.S.C. 3802(a)(2). Depending on the nature of the contract activities, the offeror may, because of possible organizational conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work from the statement, unless the solicitation specifically prohibits such exclusion. Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror shall be considered by the Government in the evaluation of proposals, and if the Government considers the proposed excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work, the proposal may be rejected as unacceptable. No award shall be made until the disclosure has been evaluated by the Government. Failure to provide the disclosure will be deemed to be a minor informality and the offeror or contractor shall be required to promptly correct the omission. If the Contracting Officer determines that a potential conflict exists, the prospective offeror shall not receive an award unless the conflict can be avoided or otherwise resolved through the inclusion of a special contract clause or other appropriate means, i.e., government approved corporate mitigation plan. The terms of this clause are subject to negotiation.

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 61 SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M-1 EVALUATION

(a) Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the best overall value to the Government in accordance with the established criteria and rating methodology set forth in Section M-2 below. (b) Selection will be based on a complete assessment of each offeror's technical proposal, past performance information and cost proposal. Within the best value continuum, the Government will employ a Price/Technical Tradeoff analysis of both price and non-price factors (FAR 15.101-1) in evaluating each proposal submitted. The Technical Factors are listed in decreasing order of importance, with Company Experience and Management Ability being equal in importance. The non-price evaluation criteria (technical and past performance), when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, as non-price factors become closer in perceived value, cost considerations will become more important. Trade-off considerations may result in the determination that it is in the best interest of the Government to award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. (c) To be considered for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for the technical factors. M-2 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. (a) The following chart depicts the Evaluation Factors to be used: NON-PRICE FACTORS Technical Factors Personnel Qualifications Company Experience Management Ability Facilities Past Performance Factor Small Business Factor Cost Factor (b) Adjectival Ratings/Definitions:

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 62

1. The following adjectival ratings and rating definitions will be used to assign an overall rating to each technical proposal except Past Performance: Table 1. Combined Technical/Risk Ratings Color Rating Description Blue Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. Purple Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. Green Acceptable Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. Yellow Marginal Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high Red Unacceptabl Proposal does not meet requirements and contains e one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.

2 Definitions: The following definitions are provided to assist evaluators in the evaluation of each factor. Definitions Strength Weakness Significant Weakness Deficiency A proposed method or technique in the proposal that exceeds the solicitation requirements and is of value to the Government. A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 63 (c) Rating Methodology All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. 1. The evaluation will be based on a complete assessment of the offeror's technical proposal, past performance information and price proposal. Technical is significantly more important that past performance and the non-price evaluation criteria (technical and past performance), when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, price becomes more important as non-price factors become equal. Non-price technical proposals shall be evaluated on the following four (4) factors which are ranked in the following order of importance: Personnel Qualifications is more important than Company Experience and Management Ability, which are of equal, but lesser importance than Personnel Qualifications, with Facilities being the least important technical factor. 2. Proposals will be assessed on how well each offeror's proposal meets the solicitation requirements and the risks associated with the offeror's approach. Determining how well the offeror's proposal meets the solicitation requirements will be accomplished in two steps. First, a determination will be made if the offeror's proposal meets the solicitation requirements. Next, the discriminators will be identified for the proposals reflecting the unique strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiencies of each offer. In addition, the Government will examine the impact of each discriminator and assess its relative value to the Government. In order to make a sound selection decision, the Government needs to understand the ways in which a given proposal is considered technically strong, as well as the ways in which it is weak or deficient. Hence, a catalog of the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies (in terms of the evaluation criteria) will be utilized to facilitate the process of determining which proposal presents the best overall value to the Government. 3. The offerors will receive one overall rating value for the non-price proposal evaluation factors. Price, while being an important factor, is not in and of itself the determining factor in the selection of the successful offeror for award of the contract contemplated by this solicitation. The Contracting Officer may reasonably determine that the superior solution/approach merits a higher price, and therefore represents the best value to the Government. The Contracting Officer, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on the integrated assessment of the Offeror(s)' non-price factors and price factor measured against the evaluation criteria listed below: 4. Evaluation of Technical Proposal: PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: The proposal will be evaluated on the offeror's demonstrated ability to provide personnel with: (1) the appropriate qualifications as set forth in Enclosure (1) of the Statement of Work; (2) actual relevant experience in the technical and scientific areas set forth in the Statement of Work; and (3) the possession by key personnel of a final favorable DoD adjudicated clearance commensurate with the level of access required for the performance of this contract prior to commencing work. The objective of this criterion is to establish that the contractor has personnel with credible capability and experience to complete the proposed work. COMPANY EXPERIENCE: The proposal will be evaluated on the offeror's demonstrated company experience in performing projects requiring scientific and technical effort which

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 64 is closely similar or related to the scientific and technical efforts set forth in the Statement of Work. MANAGEMENT ABILITY: The proposal will be evaluated on the offeror's demonstrated management ability and success in managing projects of similar complexity and duration as that set forth in the Statement of Work. The proposal will also be evaluated on the offeror's strategy for assuring a smooth and effective transition between the offeror's organization personnel and the incumbent contractor's personnel into the ongoing system development, maintenance, and operations efforts. The proposal will be evaluated on the offeror's ability to complete all the transition activities within 90 days after contract award. FACILITIES: The proposal will be evaluated on the availability of current statement-ofthe-art facilities and equipment. The offeror will be evaluated on whether these facilities and equipment are corporately owned, leased, or the property of a team member. The offeror will be evaluated on their ability to either use of acquire new resources to satisfy program requirements. Finally, the proposal will also be evaluated on the offeror's possession and ability to maintain a TOP SECRET facility clearance and SECRET storage capabilities. 5. Evaluation of Other Non-Price Factors PAST PERFORMANCE: Offeror's will be evaluated based on past performance information presented in their proposals (including past performance reports) and on information obtained by contacting the Offeror's supplied references relative to current projects or those completed within the last five (5) years. In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via offeror supplied references, commercial sources, and federal sources. The past performance evaluation will assess the degree of confidence the government has in an offeror's ability to satisfactorily meet the requirements of the contract based on the offeror's demonstrated record of performance. The past performance evaluation will consider each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the contractor's requirements. Past performance information reviewed will pertain to work performed that is similar to that required by the Statement of Work. In determining relevance, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type and schedule. Offeror's Past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the quality of the work performed, timeliness of the performance, effectiveness of management, compliance with cost/price estimates, customer satisfaction, and overall performance. An offeror with no relevant past performance information will receive a neutral rating, i.e., the rating will not add to or detract from the offeror's rating for this factor. SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION: All offerors will be evaluated on the level of small business commitment that they are demonstrating for the proposed acquisition, and their level of commitment to utilizing small businesses in performance of prior contracts. The following shall evidence small business participation: a. The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part 19, are specifically

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 65 identified in proposals; b. The extent of commitment to use such firms (enforceable commitments will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones; c. The complexity and variety of the work small firms are to perform; d. The realism of the proposal; e. Past performance of the offeror in complying with requirements of the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns; f. The extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value of the total acquisition; The extent to which the offeror provides detailed explanations/documentation supporting the proposed participation percentages, or lack thereof. The Department of Defense (DoD) has established small business goals as an assistance to assure small business receives a fair proportion of DoD awards. The goals for this procurement are as follows: Small Business: 31.7% of the total contract value; Small Disadvantaged Business: 5.0% of the total contract value; Woman-Owned Small Business: 5.0% of the total contract value; Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business: 3.0% of the total contract value; Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business: 3.0% of the total contract value. (Note, for example, that a participation plan that reflects 5.0% for Small Disadvantaged Business would also count toward the overall Small Business Goal). Offeror's past performance will be rated using the evaluation rating scales shown below: Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Rating Definition Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Present/past performance effort involved some of the Relevant scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Performance Confidence Assessments Rating Definition Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance Substantial record, the Government has a high expectation that the Confidence offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance Satisfactory record, the Government has a reasonable expectation Confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Limited Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance

SOLICITATION NUMBER N00173-12-R-TA02 PAGE 66 Confidence record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

No Confidence

Unknown Confidence (Neutral) 6. Evaluation of Cost Proposal

Volume II of the proposal will be evaluated for cost realism, reasonableness, and completeness of the proposed contract Cost Plus Fixed Fee in accordance with FAR Part 15.404-1. Cost, while being an important factor, is not in and of itself the determining factor in the selection of successful offeror for award of the contract contemplated by this solicitation. The total evaluated amount of the proposed cost plus fixed fee, to include all options, will be used in determining best price. (a) Realism. The Government may adjust the proposed cost for purposes of evaluation based upon an evaluation of cost realism. Cost Realism means that the costs in an offeror's proposal are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal. The cost realism evaluation includes an analysis of the adequacy of the hours, labor mix, and other direct costs to perform the work as proposed in the technical proposal as well as the proposed labor and indirect rates. It also includes evaluation of the likelihood that the risks inherent in the offeror's technical approach will result in higher actual costs than anticipated. (b) Completeness. Price proposals shall be evaluated for completeness by assessing the responsiveness of the proposed price, by assessing the level of detail of the offeror-provided cost data for all requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW) and assessing the traceability of estimates. For the cost data to be complete, the offeror, or its subcontractors, must provide all the data necessary to support the offer. The amount of data needed may vary depending on the requirements.

____________________________________________________________________________________ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.59 per hour or $143.60 per week or $622.27 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and Page 7

05-2103 related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

05-2103 The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Page 9

05-2103 Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
