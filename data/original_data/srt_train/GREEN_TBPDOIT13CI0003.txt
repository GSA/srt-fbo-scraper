Background

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is one of eleven bureaus of the Department of the Treasury. Its mission is to promote the financial integrity and operational efficiency of the United States government through exceptional accounting, borrowing, collections, payments, and shared services. Fiscal Service is located in Washington, D.C.; Hyattsville, Maryland; Austin, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Birmingham, Alabama; and Parkersburg, West Virginia. Fiscal Service helps to fund the federal government by selling Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2012, the total amount outstanding for all U.S. Treasury securities was $16.4 trillion, broken down into wholesale (98.7 percent) and retail securities (1.3 percent). ˇ Wholesale securities are marketable Treasury securities sold through the commercial market to major securities dealers, financial institutions, and foreign central banks. The program is operated by Fiscal Service's Office of Financing (OF). OF oversees the commercial book-entry securities system and conducts auctions of marketable Treasury securities to help finance the bulk of the national debt. The Fiscal Service holds regularly scheduled auctions of bills, notes, TIPS, and bonds. Fiscal Service also conducts auctions of cash management bills on an as-needed basis. Retail securities represent non marketable Treasury securities sold directly to the public and held on Treasury's systems.

ˇ

The Office of Retail Securities (Retail) Retail has operational responsibility for Treasury's Retail Securities program and the policies, procedures, and regulations governing securities. The program allows Retail investors to purchase savings bonds and marketable securities in electronic form directly from Treasury. The following securities products are currently offered for sale through the Retail Securities program: Wholesale Securities ˇ Treasury bills are short-term government securities with maturities ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. Bills are sold at a discount or at par. ˇ Treasury notes are government securities that are issued with maturities between 1 and 10 years and pay interest every six months. ˇ Treasury bonds pay interest every six months and mature in more than 10 years. ˇ Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are marketable securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index. TIPS pay interest every six months and are issued with maturities of 5, 10, and 30 years. Retail Securities ˇ Series I Savings Bonds, sold at face value, are accrual savings products that earn interest for up to 30 years while protecting customers from inflation. ˇ Series EE Savings Bonds are accrual savings products that pay interest based on current market rates for up to 30 years. Electronic EE Savings Bonds are sold at face value. TreasuryDirectŽ Retail's flagship system is TreasuryDirect, an online proprietary system that allows a customer to manage their accounts without assistance from a customer service representative as well as to buy and hold savings bonds and marketable securities in a single electronic account. Launched in 2002, this 24x7 Internet-accessed system allows customers to establish TreasuryDirect accounts, purchase securities, direct electronic payments to bank accounts, and manage holdings online in a secure environment. TBPDOIT13CI0003

14

Customers set up an account online and the system verifies the customer's identity during the account establishment process. If identity cannot be verified, the customer completes off-line paperwork and mails it to Retail. Once customers access their accounts, they can buy savings bonds and marketable securities in TreasuryDirect. Customers can set up automatically recurring purchases and can even arrange payroll deductions. A customer can also make purchases with funds from a Certificate of Indebtedness (C of I), a noninterest-earning security in TreasuryDirect (the Fiscal Service is not a depository institution and does not hold cash). TreasuryDirect gathers all purchase requests and holds them until the scheduled purchase dates. Through TreasuryDirect, customers can also redeem securities, reinvest marketable securities, manage tax withholdings, view and print 1099 forms, and make changes to their account profile information as necessary. A customer can manage accounts on behalf of minor children. It is also possible to purchase a savings bond(s) as a gift. A gift can be purchased at any time, but the bond(s) cannot be delivered until the recipient of the gift establishes a TreasuryDirect account. Retail Customer Service Retail employees issue, service, reissue, and redeem savings bonds as well as manage marketable securities accounts. Employees also process claims, update account information, and coordinate day-to-day customer service operations for more than 50 million investors most of whom are individuals. This activity encompasses more than 15 million transactions annually. Although certain securities are no longer available for purchase, Retail accounts for more than six billion records that must be managed. These include ownership records, transactions, redemptions, retirements, claims, and other customer service activities. Customer service for the Retail Securities program is provided by two Treasury Retail Securities (TRS) customer service processing sites. One site is located at the Fiscal Service facilities in Parkersburg, West Virginia. The other site is at the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of Minneapolis. On behalf of Fiscal Service, Minneapolis also provides infrastructure and system support. Retail is in the midst of a multi-year effort to create a virtual customer service and support environment spanning both TRS sites. The project, called TRES (Treasury Retail E-Services), employs Oracles' Siebel CRM tool to integrate customer history and interactions across multiple communication channels--telephone, e-mail, white mail, and, in the future, web chat. The goals are to improve customer service by increasing access to customer contact information and to move to an environment that allows more flexibility in assigning customer service representatives to specific tasks. The Future of Retail In Retail's vision, a modern Retail Securities program will offer direct-access, electronic securities, shifting customers away from legacy systems and paper-based processes; provide efficient, quality customer service; and use technology to empower customers to manage their accounts at their convenience. The program will fulfill legacy obligations, maintain the safety and security of customer information and investments, and responsibly introduce new products and services. Retail will continually strive to reduce the cost of its services by identifying and implementing ways to streamline processes, minimize duplicative work, and optimize the use of technology.

When a security matures, all proceeds will be made by ACH. ˇ Redemptions. Customers shall be able to redeem securities; the proceeds will be deposited into their bank account. ˇ Withhold taxes, tax reporting. The solution shall have the capability to withhold taxes from interest payments and redemptions, and perform necessary IRS reporting. ˇ Accounting, reporting, reconciling. The solution shall provide the functionality necessary for controlling and managing all account and transaction accounting, reporting and reconciliation activity. ˇ Risk and Fraud Management. The solution shall provide a robust suite of tools for managing risk and preventing fraudulent activity. As part of Retail operations, a TRIM solution shall provide mechanisms for interfacing or processing data to/from external systems for the following purposes: ˇ Auction Processing: TRIM shall support the Treasury marketable securities auction process. Initial information on upcoming security offerings is available as early as 8 weeks prior to the auction of a security. Typically all announcements are made 1-3 days prior to the auction (with the exception of a cash management bill). Auctions occur on the date and time specified in the announcement of the security. Auction results are used to calculate the purchase price of a marketable security, factoring in discount, premium, rate and yield. The solution will need to process and execute a securities purchase process that is dependent on noncompetitive bidding close times for each auction. Each marketable security is uniquely identified with a CUSIP. Settlement information, interest payment dates, interest payment rates and inflation indexes for a security will be provided post auction and must be supported as part of the securities portfolio management process. Savings Bond Interest Processing: TRIM's security portfolio management process shall include a mechanism for calculating the redemption or maturity amount of a savings bond based on its issue date and redemption or maturity date. Retail currently maintains this data; sorted by Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) (a unique identifier) in a Current Redemption Value (CRV) database. CUSIPs are generated on a monthly basis for savings bonds. Identity Verification: The TRIM solution shall provide a mechanism for real-time interfacing with thirdparty systems for identity verification. Currently, Fiscal Service uses a third-party solution that relies on a REST web service. The identify verification process includes a search of national and global watch lists (e.g., terror watch lists, fraud watch lists, OFAC check, etc.).

Bureau of the Fiscal Service IT Rules of Behavior

SUBJECT: Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) Information Technology (IT) Security Rules of Behavior should be signed prior to any "USER" engaging work using, creating, maintaining, or updating BFS IT assets.

PURPOSE: Pursuant to Treasury Directive 85-01, these rules ensure that "BFS IT system users" (USERS) are made aware of their security responsibilities before accessing BFS's IT resources. All USERS are required to read and sign these rules acknowledging their responsibilities in protecting BFS's IT systems and data. Noncompliance with these rules may result in termination of access privileges, administrative actions, and/or criminal prosecution if warranted.

SCOPE: This standard is applicable to all USERS who access IT systems where BFS information is processed, transmitted, and stored. For the purpose of this document, USERS are defined as employees, contractors, FRB staff, or others who are granted access to BFS operated IT systems for performing work. At BFS's discretion, individuals who have access to BFS IT systems may not be considered USERS under this definition and as such may not be required to sign these Rules of Behavior.

In addition to the rules and requirements contained within this document, USERS should note that other federal laws and regulations apply when accessing BFS IT resources (i.e., licensing agreements and copyright laws), but are considered outside the scope of this document.

RULES OF BEHAVIOR: ACCESS:

ˇ

ˇ ˇ

Not read, alter, insert, copy, or delete any BFS data except in accordance with assigned job responsibilities. Ability to access data does not equate to authority to manipulate data. In particular, USERS must not browse or search BFS data except in the performance of authorized duties. Notify their Supervisor when access to IT resources is no longer required, and make no further attempts to access the resources. Protect BFS IT systems and networks. Dial-in or other remote access to BFS systems and networks is prohibited, unless specifically authorized in a manner approved by the Network Security Officer (NSO).

4

Attachment A ­ Security Requirements
ACTIONS:

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

Not attempt to circumvent any BFS IT security control mechanisms. Reverse engineering or tampering with IT resources is prohibited. Protect BFS equipment, software, and data from loss, theft, damage, and unauthorized use or disclosure. Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information. Not view, send, retain, or reproduce content that is fraudulent, harassing, or obscene in nature.

AWARENESS:

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Understand that the use of BFS IT resources gives consent for monitoring and security testing to ensure proper security procedures and appropriate usage are being observed. Complete IT security awareness, training, and education as required by Treasury and BFS policies. Become knowledgeable about BFS IT policies and standards. As systems change, USERS are required to seek additional information from sources such as their Information System Security Representative (ISSR), the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) for specific systems, BFS Information Technology Security Manual (ITSM), or the IT Security Zone on PDWeb in order to ensure current policies and procedures are followed.

EMAIL:

ˇ ˇ

Not access any external (non-BFS) email account from any BFS IT resource, except where the Network Security Officer (NSO) has approved a written request from the Division Director or higher level supervisor of the requestor. Not subscribe to email lists that generate incoming non-work-related email such as "joke of the day" or "recipe of the day." Work related email newsletters are permitted.

EQUIPMENT & SOFTWARE:

ˇ

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Understand that any unauthorized use of government owned or non-government owned hardware or software on any BFS IT resource (network, workstation, laptop, wireless devices, etc.) is prohibited. If the use of non-standard items is necessary, a written request from the Division Director or higher level management official must be approved by the Network Security Officer (NSO) before such items are used on BFS IT resources. Report improper or suspicious use of BFS equipment (viruses, unauthorized access, theft, inappropriate use, etc.) and any known or suspected breaches of IT security to their supervisor and BFS IT Service Desk at 304-480-7777 immediately after discovery of the occurrence. Not use BFS IT resources (including but not limited to email, fax machines, and copiers) to produce chain letters. Comply with guidance on limited personal use of Government office equipment.

PASSWORDS:

ˇ ˇ

Follow proper logon/logoff procedures: don't divulge account access procedures to any unauthorized user, don't disclose password to other people, don't allow someone else to watch as USERS enter passwords to logon, and logoff of systems. Understand and follow the rules and recommendations for password protection as stated in BFS's IT Security Manual (Chapter 6) and the Department of the Treasury Security Program TD P 85-01 (5.1.1) and agree to use only the User-ID for which they are authorized.

PHYSICAL SECURITY The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements for Contractors and Subcontractors 13-032 A. GENERAL

The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) has determined that performance of this contract requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s), and vendor(s) (herein known as Contractor), requires access to Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) information (herein known as unclassified information) and the contract was evaluated as "High Risk." All contractor and subcontractor personnel who require access to work under this contract shall be United States Citizens. The Contractor will abide by the requirements set forth in the Non-Disclosure Agreement, included in the contract, for the protection of unclassified information at its cleared facility. If the Contractor has access to unclassified information at the BFS or other Government Facility, it will abide by the requirements set by that agency. B. SUITABILITY DETERMINATION

Contractor personnel, assigned to this contract, even those who possess a National Security Clearance, will not need access to classified information, although they must undergo suitability screening conducted by the Office of Security. BFS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding, or terminating unescorted government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for these contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation. C. BACKGROUND

52.204-9 PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (JAN 2011) (a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201. (b) The Contractor shall account for all forms of Government-provided identification issued to the Contractor employees in connection with performance under this contract. The Contractor shall return such identification to the issuing agency at the earliest of any of the following, unless otherwise determined by the Government; (1) When no longer needed for contract performance. (2) Upon completion of the Contractor employee's employment. (3) Upon contract completion or termination. (c) The Contracting Officer may delay final payment under a contract if the Contractor fails to comply with these requirements. (d) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts when the subcontractor's employees are required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. It shall be the responsibility of the prime Contractor to return such identification to the issuing agency in accordance with the terms set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. THE BUREAU OF THE FISCAL SERVICE ADDENDUM TO AB NO. 05-12R1 Performance of this contract requires contractor and subcontractor personnel to sign and submit an NDA, have an appropriate level background investigation initiated, and a favorable FBI fingerprint check completed before

being allowed unsupervised logical or physical access to Government facilities or IT systems and information. All contractor and subcontractor personnel working under this contract will be US citizens. A Federal Government issued personnel identification card must be issued before unsupervised physical access to a government facility or logical access to Government IT system or information is permitted. The Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will be the sponsoring official and will coordinate with Personnel Security to arrange the background investigation and credentialing process. At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor will identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who will require physical and/or logical access for the performance of work under this contract. Identified contractor and subcontractor personnel will complete and return the below listed documents to the COR. The Contractor must make all contractor and subcontractor personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate the credentialing process. ˇ Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) portal to provide historical background information for background investigations: http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/ ˇ OF 306 (fillable forms available at: http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/of.asp) ˇ Fair Credit Reporting Release ˇ Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) At minimum, a Background Investigation (BI) level case, which satisfies HSPD-12 background investigation requirements, will be completed for the applicable contractor and subcontractor personnel. This process provides the government with a means to positively identify and make a suitability determination regarding the applicant under this contract. If it is determined that the sensitivity of the accessed government information warrants further investigations, a higher level investigation will be conducted. If the government information accessed by Contractor or subcontractor personnel is determined to be Critical-Sensitive, it may be required that the Background Investigation be fully completed and favorably adjudicated prior to granting contractor or subcontractor personnel with access. Contractor and subcontractor personnel are required to give full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. The Government's investigative personnel may contact the contractor and subcontractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone, or in writing. The contractor will ensure that all contractor and subcontractor personnel are available for such contact and that timely responses to investigative requests are provided. Alternatively, if it is verified that an individual is already vetted by another agency at the appropriate level of background investigation, and the investigation was completed less than five (5) years prior to the start of the contractor's initial logical/physical access date, then further investigation may not be necessary. If this is applicable, provide the COR with the name of the agency that conducted the investigation and completion date, if known. If at any point during this process investigative results are unfavorably adjudicated, the individual will be denied further admittance to work on the contract, including both physical and/or logical access. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this contract, the Government shall have the right of final determination. During performance of the contract, the Contractor will keep the COR apprised of any changes in personnel to ensure that work performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing process. Identification cards that are lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COTR and Issuing Office within 18 hours. Replacement will be at the Contractor's expense. If re-issuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COR.

Attachment A ­ Security Requirements
At the end of the contract performance, or when a contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the contractor will ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR. If the contractor does not return all identification cards then last payment may be withheld. This requirement must be incorporated into any subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have regular and routine unsupervised physical access to a federally controlled facility for six (6) months or more, or any unsupervised logical access to a federally controlled information system. Physical Access: Is the ability to enter a federally owned facility or federally leased space: - If federal space is limited to a portion of a building then HSPD-12 applies only to that portion owned or leased by the federal government. - Physical access requirements do not apply to: Contractors (permanent, intermittent, temporary or seasonal), guests researchers, and volunteers needing access for less than six (6) months Logical Access: Ability to access federal IT systems or databases ­ applies to everyone regardless of how long access is required and whether within a federal facility or by remote connectivity.

Bureau of the Fiscal Service Conditional Access to Sensitive but Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement I, ____________________________, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted conditional access to certain United States Government documents or material containing sensitive but unclassified information. I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions: 1. By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 2. As used in the Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C. 522a, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. 3. I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of providing a COTS solution for an online application to deliver financial services to Retail customers. This approval will permit me conditional access to certain information, administrative and technical data and/or to attend meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise made available to me. 4. I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information that is provided to me pursuant to this Agreement to anyone unless I have been advised in writing by Bureau of the Fiscal Service or in the case of bureau sensitive but unclassified information released to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) or Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), in accordance with a written arrangement related to the official audit/investigative functions of the OIG or TIGTA for that particular matter). Should I desire to make use of any sensitive but unclassified information, I will do so in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Agreement. I will submit to Bureau of the Fiscal Service for security review, prior to any submissions for publication, any book, article, column or other written work for general publication that is based upon any knowledge I obtained during the course of my work, in order for the BFS to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed. 5. I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 6. Upon signing this non-disclosure agreement, I will be permitted access to official Bureau of Public Debt documents containing sensitive but unclassified information and understand that any copies must be protected in the same manner as the originals. Any notes taken during the course of such access must also be protected in the same manner as the originals. 7. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information could compromise Bureau of the Fiscal Service security.

10

Attachment A ­ Security Requirements
8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information. This may serve as a basis for my being denied conditional access to Bureau of Public Debt or other Treasury bureaus' information, both classified and sensitive but unclassified information in the future. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief. The willful disclosure of information to which I have agreed herein not to divulge may constitute a criminal offense. 9. Unless and until I am provided a written release by Bureau of the Fiscal Service from this Agreement or any portions of it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of my work on the COTS solution for an online application, and at all times thereafter. 10. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provisions of this Agreement unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 11. I understand that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. 12. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive but unclassified information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement. 13. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights or liabilities created by Executive Order 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.)(governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents), and the statutes that protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 128, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC Section 783 (b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling. 14. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or effect in any manner any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government except within the Department of the Treasury as noted in item 8, above. 15. I make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
