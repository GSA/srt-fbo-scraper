version 1.0

This overview is provided for informational purposes only, as a means for providing background. Specific contractor performance requirements are outlined in other areas of the Statement of Work 1.0 INFORMATION ASSURANCE COMPLIANCE SECTION The Information Assurance Compliance Section is responsible for ensuring that TSA complies with all the provisions of the FISMA law of 2002. The Section coordinates with other TSA and DHS security organizations concerning physical, facility, personnel, industrial, and information security to carry out assigned security tasks. The Compliance Section is composed of three Branches: FISMA Compliance, Certification and Accreditation (C&A), and Training and Awareness; below is a description of each Branch detailing their specific areas of responsibility. 1.1 Summary of FISMA Compliance Branch

The FISMA Compliance Branch works to achieve TSA compliance with the FISMA Act of 2002. The team's members liaise with all FISMA stakeholders in order to achieve high levels of compliance and to disseminate related information. In FY09, TSA achieved a 100% compliance rating on the annual DHS FISMA Scorecard. The IT Security FISMA Compliance Branch is a component of the Information Assurance Division, a federally mandated program. Each year DHS improves and further strengthens the level of rigor with which components must comply. This achievement underscores the level of success the FISMA team has achieved. The FISMA team will stay abreast of these changes, communicate these changes to all FISMA stakeholders, and offer assistance with how to best comply with the new requirements. 1.2 Summary of C&A Branch

The Certification and Accreditation branch conducts (C&A) activities that support a risk management process and are an integral part of TSA's information security program. The C&A process consist of the four distinct phases: Initiation, Certification, Accreditation, and Continuous Monitoring. Security accreditation is the official management decision to authorize operation of an information system. This authorization, given by a senior agency official, is applicable to a particular environment or operation, and explicitly accepts the risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals, remaining after the implementation of an agreed upon set of security controls. By accrediting an information system, the agency official is not only responsible for the security of the system but is also accountable for adverse impacts to the agency if a breach of security occurs. At TSA, this official is the Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA). Security accreditation is required under the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347), OMB Circular A-130, and DHS and TSA
Page 1 of 19

Management Directives. Title III of the E-Government Act is entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). Security certification is the comprehensive evaluation of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system. This evaluation, made in support of the security accreditation process, determines the effectiveness of these security controls in a particular environment of operation and the vulnerabilities in the information system after the implementation of such controls. Security C&A of the TSA information systems support the legislative requirements of FISMA by ensuring that the TSA periodically: (i) assesses the risk resulting from the operation of those systems; (ii) tests and evaluates the security controls in those systems to determine control effectiveness and system vulnerabilities; and (iii) assesses the information security programs supporting those systems (e.g., security awareness and training, incident response, and contingency planning). Formalization of the C&A process ensures that information systems will be operated with appropriate management review, that there is ongoing monitoring of security controls, and that reaccreditation occurs periodically and whenever there is a significant change to the system or its environment. The C&A Branch consists of primary certifiers (PC) assigned to designated information systems to support the TSA mandate to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program for federal information systems; promote a better understanding of agencyrelated risks resulting from the operation of information systems; create more reliable, complete, and trustworthy information for authorizing officials--thus, facilitating more informed security accreditation decisions; and help achieve more secure information systems within the TSA. 1.3 Summary of Training and Awareness Branch

The Training and Awareness Branch is charged with implementing programs that ensure TSA meets the FISMA requirements for IT Security Awareness and IT Security training for individuals with Significant Security Responsibilities (SSRs). The branch is also responsible for executing the agency wide IT Security Awareness program and the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) administration program. The Team designs, develops (with the technical assistance and expertise from personnel within the IAD), schedules, coordinates, and produces the monthly ISSO SSR training meetings that are required to meet FISMA Compliance obligations. The training section liaisons with all necessary external entities to ensure the agency as a whole is fully appraised of all new and emerging training and awareness information. 1.4 Section Primary Stakeholders and Interfaces of the Information Assurance Compliance

The Information Assurance Compliance Section supports all major programs within the TSA. The primary stakeholders within the TSA programs are the IT System Owners, the Information System Security Officer's (ISSOs), and the individual Program Managers assigned within each
Page 2 of 19

TSA wide program. Ultimately the Section supports all TSA personnel who use any IT asset in the performance of their assigned duties. 1.5 FY 09 Achievements of the Information Assurance Compliance Section

In an effort to provide an overview of what was accomplished by the Compliance Section in FY09, the following metrics are provided. ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The Information Assurance FISMA Branch obtained a perfect 100 percent FISMA score from the DHS. The Section conducted 48 Certification and Accreditation packages, which resulted in 48 of the TSA IT systems receiving an Authorization to Operate. The Section conducted 84 Security Controls Self-Assessments in accordance with NIST 80053 publication requirements. The Section ensured 84 Contingency Test Plans were executed and submitted to DHS. The Section used the DHS mandated Trusted Agent FISMA Tool (TAFT) and the Risk Management System (RMS) to perform all four phases of the C&A process. This included uploading and managing over 1,800 Plans of Actions and Milestones, 800 C&A documents to include the 11 mandated DHS documents in order to obtain an IT system ATO (SSP, CP, CPTR, E-Auth, FIPS-199, PTA, Self-Assessment, Risk Assessment, ST&E Plan, SAR and ATO Letter). The DHS measures the TSA using the annual DHS FISMA Performance Plan, which requires TSA to maintain a 96 percent completion rate for all artifacts mentioned above. The Section reviewed all FISMA and C&A artifacts and provided agency level validation attesting that all documentation met the DHS annual FISMA performance plan. The Section prepared 24 Significant Security Responsibility training modules for presentation to the ISSOs (60 ISSOs). The Section executed the day to day administration of the Training and Awareness program to include day-to-day liaison with the ISSOs to ensure they have all the latest information and tools to perform their duties. The Section hosted monthly training sessions, sending out Bi-monthly agency wide broadcast to ensure all computer users are in compliance with the DHS mandated IT awareness training. The Section managed the TSA official IT Systems inventory. This includes adding, deleting, disposing, and tracking all system changes while they are in the development or operational status of the System Life-Cycle process. The Section managed day to day accountability of the department's official FISMA scorecard. This required daily liaison with the DHS CISO office to ensure the scorecard was 100 percent accurate prior to producing weekly reports for the senior and executive leadership at TSA. The daily scorecard also acts as a day-to-day barometer check which

helped in prioritizing the Branch priorities. The DHS measured the TSA using the annual DHS FISMA Performance Plan, which requires TSA to maintain a 96 percent completion rate. 1.6 Information Assurance Compliance Section Goals and Objectives

Using the metrics and information obtained from FY09 the bullets below represent the Compliance Section Goals and Objectives for FY10. It is the expectation that these goals and objectives will be met in FY09 and beyond. It is expected that the goals and objectives outlined in the annual DHS Information Security Performance Plan will continue to increase year after year to measure success in the area of FISMA compliance for DHS. The Compliance Section will be expected continue to meet and/or exceed the goals and objectives outlined in the annual DHS Information Security Performance Plan, which includes: ˇ ˇ Obtain a 98 percent FISMA score from the DHS. Maintain security compliance for a minimum 83 operational TSA IT Systems and a minimum of 30 Development systems. There is an annual 10% expectation of growth for operational systems. Conduct 55 Certification and Accreditation packages which will result in 55 of the TSA IT systems receiving an Authorization to Operate. Conduct 88 Security Controls Self-Assessments in accordance with NIST 800-53 publication requirements. Execute and submit 88 Contingency Test Plans to DHS. The Section uses the DHS mandated Trusted Agent FISMA Tool (TAFT) and the Risk Management System (RMS) to perform all four phases of the C&A process. This includes uploading and managing over 1,800 Plans of Actions and Milestones and 800 C&A documents, which include the 11 mandated DHS documents needed to obtain an IT system ATO (SSP, CP, CPTR, E-Auth, FIPS-199, PTA, Self-Assessment, Risk Assessment, ST&E Plan, SAR and ATO Letter). The DHS measures the TSA using the annual DHS FISMA Performance Plan, which requires TSA to maintain a 96 percent completion rate for all artifacts mentioned above. Review all FISMA and C&A artifacts and provides agency level validation attesting that all documentation meets the DHS annual FISMA performance plan. Prepare 24 Significant Security Responsibility training modules for presentation to the ISSOs (60 plus ISSOs). Execute the day to day administration of the Training and Awareness program to include day-to-day liaison with the ISSOs to ensure they have all the latest information and tools to perform their duties.

This section also plays a key role in the TSA IT Buy process. The TSA IT Buy process helps initiate and funnel procurement request (PR) documents through a number of key evaluators for review and acceptance within OIT divisions (i.e., Information Assurance (IA), Solution Delivery (SD), Systems Integration (SI), Operational Effectiveness (OE), Business Management Office (BMO), et al.). Within the IAD, TSA IT Buy submits the PR packages to the Business Management manager who, in turn, conducts a thorough review and/or submits the PR to one of his/her analyst for review. This team ensures the proper security literature and security controls are addressed for the specific procurement request. If information is lacking, it goes back to the Requestor/Originator via the "TSA IT Buy" Office with recommended security verbiage. If the proper information technology security information is addressed, the BMO manager accepts/approves the PR submission and advises TSA IT Buy. The Governance Section is composed of two major teams to include: Policy and Architecture (SPA) Branch and the Contract Performance/Metrics Branch (CPM). The SPA Branch supports the TSA mission to enhance its security posture by ensuring that DHS IT security policies are communicated and are included in TSA-unique security policy instructions. The SPA team ensures security of TSA's IT infrastructure by establishing and maintaining an IT Security Architecture (SA) program conforming to Federal and DHS mandated Enterprise Architecture (EA) initiatives that guide the development of IT infrastructure. This team also ensures that IT security architecture and policies align with and support TSA's mission and national critical functions. Lastly, it strives to improve the productivity of the IAD through continuous development and documentation of processes that enhance the functional performance of the IAD. The CPM Branch supports the TSA mission by ensuring IT security related Contractor performance, service level agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics are in compliance in order to reduce IT related security risks. These efforts include the proper methodologies, processes, procedures, and policy reviews to conform to TSA mandates. Other monitoring functions include reviews of: contract performance, director surveys, procurement request review and routing, security program plan updates, and review of OMB's Exhibit 300s for several critical systems. The Contractor will review internal and external procurement requests to ensure that language in the PR matches the language in the SOW and to ensure that the dollar amount of the procurement request matches the Independent Government Cost Estimate. The Contractor will review the Security and Privacy sections of the OMB Exhibit 300's to ensure appropriate security language is included. Should any discrepancies be noted by the Contractor, PRs and OMB Exhibit 300s will be returned to Government personnel for correction. The Governance Section proactively researches, develops, coordinates, and communicates the IT security solutions that provide in-depth security for the enduring success of the TSA mission. Within the Office of Information Technology (OIT), the Governance Section provides direct

4.0 INFORMATION ASSURANCE TECHNICAL SERVICES SECTION 4.1 Summary of the Information Assurance Technical Services Section

The Technical Services Section is a component of the IAD, a federally mandated program. The Technical Services Section is comprised of four Branches: Digital Forensics, Computer Network Defense, Secure Communications (also known as Communications Security (COMSEC) and Security Engineering. The Security Engineering Team is outside the scope of this contract. 4.1.1 Digital Forensics Branch

The Digital Forensics Branch is a component of the IAD. The Branch provides forensics analysis capabilities and guidance necessary to accurately investigate/analyze incidents throughout the TSA enterprise. The Branch also provides federally mandated capabilities for electronic discovery providing collection and analysis services. The Branch coordinates with other TSA and DHS security organizations concerning inspections, counter intelligence, and
Page 9 of 19

physical, facility, personnel, industrial, and information security to carry out assigned investigations as well as providing support services to requesting organizations. The Branch proactively investigates incidents and requests, producing detailed forensics analysis reports that are vital to enduring success of the TSA mission. ˇ The Digital Forensics Branch supports IT security CIRC operations providing deep dive forensics analysis and data parsing of digital evidence relating to incidents. CIRC is the Digital Forensics Branch Primary customer. The Digital Forensics Branch provides data recovery services to all requesting TSA operations. These types of operations include data recovery from failing hard disks, email recovery, and log recovery. The Digital Forensics Branch supports two Departments within Office of Inspections, Inspections Division, and Program Review. The IT Security Digital Forensics Branch provides technical support and guidance on specific case work. To include email tape backup and recovery operations, network drive recovery, and encryption key recovery. These efforts are vital support operations since all necessary decryption of OI evidence items are dependent on these services. The Digital Forensics Branch supports Office of Chief Council in pursuit of their investigations regarding digital evidence. Services provided include email recovery, data recovery, forensic guidance, device imaging, and complete forensics analysis of all related requests. The Digital Forensics Branch also supports requests from the Office of Information Technology to include drive degaussing/destruction, data recovery, and forensics analysis when necessary. Computer Network Defense Branch

4.1.2

The Computer Network Defense Branch has three sub-teams corresponding to its three functions: The Computer Security Incident Response Team manages and coordinates the response to security incidents, the SOC Management team provides oversight to the Security Operations Center, and the Threat and Vulnerability Management manages the response to threat intelligence and publicly announced vulnerabilities. The Computer Network Defense Branch is composed of three separate groups that report to the Branch Chief. The first group is the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). The CSIRT accepts the escalation of possible computer security incidents from multiple sources including the TSA Security Operations Center (SOC), the DHS SOC, TSA Management, and the TSA Office of Inspections. The CSIRT is responsible for investigating events and validating whether they constitute a computer security incident. Once an event has been confirmed to be an incident, the CSIRT is responsible for identifying containment and remediation strategies, managing and coordinating the activities of the fix agencies that implement those strategies,
Page 10 of 19

tracking all progress, and reporting the incident and the mitigation and remediation actions taken to the DHS SOC and to TSA Management. The CSIRT maintains a presence both on the SOC located in Ashburn VA and at TSA HQ in Arlington VA. The second group is the SOC Management Team (SMT). Growing insight into the monitoring capability of the incumbent Managed Service provider led to the realization that the functions of the Security Operations Center needed to be separated from the rest of the Managed Services. An independent SOC function became a priority, resulting in initiating the acquisition of a new vendor for SOC services. The SMT is responsible for overseeing the TSA SOC. This includes acting as a liaison between IT Security and the SOC, providing continuous monitoring and evaluation of SOC performance, and maintaining subject matter expertise knowledge of the TSA IT Security devices. The SMT works closely with the CSIRT during incidents in order to insure that the CSIRT receives the information and support that they need. The SMT maintains a presence both on the SOC premises and at TSA HQ. The third group is the Threat and Vulnerability Management Team (TVMT). This team monitors both public and classified intelligence sources in order to identify threats and vulnerabilities that impact the TSA environment. The TVMT maintains a working knowledge of the technologies used within TSA systems and the various security controls used to protect those technologies. The TVMT also accepts Information Security Vulnerability Management announcements from DHS, distributes those announcements to the Information System Security Officers within TSA, tracks compliance efforts, and reports the results back to DHS. The TVMT works closely with both the CSIRT and the SMT to insure that those teams have the best possible advance intelligence upon which to take proactive action. 4.1.3 Secure Communications Branch

The IAD Secure Communications team is responsible through the TSA CISO and CIO to the DHS Central Office of Record (COR) for the receipt, transfer, accountability, safeguarding, and destruction of COMSEC material assigned to their TSA COMSEC account and management/operation of the TSA HQ Local Management Device (LMD)/Key Processor (KP) and the associated Local COMSEC Management Software (LCMS). The Secure Communications team provides policy oversight, technical guidance and Help Desk support to every TSA HQ, field Federal Security Directors, and Mass Transit and Railroad COMSEC equipment users. The COMSEC Staff at TSA is based at TSA HQ, but also has 3 Regional Managers geographically dispersed on the East Coast, Central US, and West Coast. These are currently located in Philadelphia, San Diego, and San Antonio, but are subject to change.

Acquired the new generation Voice-Over-IP (VOIP) VIPER Secure Telephone unit from General Dynamics and had an RFC approved for the two units, which were successfully Tested and Evaluated on TSANet for functionality and network compatibility. As part of the NSA Cryptographic Modernization Program, IAD Secure Communications began preparing for the transition from the Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) FORTEZZA Plus cryptographic card, which supports the transition from the antiquated STU-III technology to the new Enhanced Cryptographic Card (ECC). This effort has required software upgrades to 362 STEs nationwide. Identified the requirements for the new DHS HSDN "Fly Away" unit, and connectivity coordination with HSDN PMO and their contractor staff, TSA Office of Inspections, and TSA Office of Intelligence. TSA COMSEC responds to approximately 350 customer inquiries or service calls a month. The COMSEC Staff at TSA is based at TSA HQ however, there are 3 Regional Managers geographically dispersed on the East Coast, Central US, and West Coast. The regional areas are subject to change they are currently located in Philadelphia, PA; San Diego, CA; and San Antonio, TX; but are subject to change. COMSEC personnel will have core working hours with emergency on-call status. Information Assurance Technical Services Section Goals and Objectives

Using the metrics and information obtained from FY09, the below objectives represent the Technical Services Section Goals and Objectives for FY10. It is the expectation that these goals and objectives will be met in FY10 and beyond. It is expected that the goals and objectives outlined will continue to increase year after year to measure success in Technical Services Section. The Technical Services Section will be expected continue to meet and/or exceed these

Page 13 of 19

goals and objectives. There is an anticipated workload increase of 5-10 percent annually as the agency and the discipline of security operations continues to mature. This overview is provided for informational purposes only, as a means for providing background. Specific contractor performance requirements are outlined in other areas of the Statement of Work. 4.4.1 Digital Forensics Branch Goals and Objectives

Projected case load to be equal to or greater than 150 cases for FY10; 50% of those cases are expected to be detailed forensic support or email recovery taking more than two weeks of effort each. Expanded support effort will be provided to Office of Inspections to included Program Analysis and E-Discovery. The Office of Inspection has developed a counter intelligence capability and our support from a network forensics perspective is critical. Expanded support is also projected in training development and delivery for necessary skill development throughout DHS. As one of the most mature Digital Forensics Programs within DHS, we are asked to provide significant support for DHS Wide efforts. The Digital Forensics Branch will be developing a malware reverse engineering capability. As the threats to our network evolve, rapid detection and analysis of malware behavior is critical to effective containment and remediation. The Digital Forensics Branch will also be developing a malware sandbox network. Malware sandboxes are critical tools for detecting the behavior of malware. The Branch will also be continuing a technical refresh of the lab environment including the introduction of Forensic workstations that utilize the Mac Operating system In addition, the Branch will develop advanced processes and procedures to proactively detect network intrusions and compromises. 4.4.2 Computer Network Defense Branch Goals and Objectives

A big effort to be undertaken in FY10 will be the addition of remote systems to TSA SOC Monitoring. This will require significant effort from the CND Team. The IAD expects the FAMS Data Center 2 (DC2) migration and OneNet efforts of DHS to continue to be a challenge. Oversight of the new Managed Service provider's IT Security program and management of the SOC services contract will become crucial to maintenance of a low-risk security posture. Oversight of the contractor implementation of the ISO 27001 standard for the ITIP, the Human
Page 14 of 19

Resources Access (HRAccess) system, and SOC contracts may take more resources than expected. Multiple Laws and Regulations are pending. These will have to be monitored. The CND team will begin Security Monitoring of the non-OIT managed IT systems and integrate these systems with the IAD's Incident Response procedures. The CND team will support the revision of the CONOPS and the SOPs. The CND team will develop a Cyber Intelligence capability. This capability will help manage the continuing threat that Government networks are currently under. 4.4.3 Secure Communications Branch Goals and Objectives

The team expects the workload to grow with the operational and technical cryptographic upgrades for new generation equipments supporting TSA HQ, Freedom Center, Site W, and TTAC. Enhancements to LMD/KP and sub-account LMDS will focus on transitioning key material support all secure telephony devices and accounting procedures from manual input/output of the obsolete NSA-supported Distributed Information Security Accounting System (DIAS) to fully electronic capabilities supported 100% through the NSA Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) and the DHS Central Office of Record (COR). With the activation of the DHS COR LMD/KP system, improved management processes, on-the-job/formal training, and major improvements should be experienced. The Secure Communications Branch will explore the functional requirements and oversight requirements to establish a DHS TSA Central Office of Record (COR) Manager. The DHS TSA COR Manager (the Secure Communications Branch Chief) will be responsible for policy oversight, coordination of COMSEC training and auditing the three TSA HQ LMD subaccounts, whereas the TSA HQ Parent Account would remain under audit responsibility of the DHS COR. Additionally, authority would be requested from the DHS COR for the new DHS TSA COR Manager to assume policy coordination, cryptographic modernization coordination, internal audit, and training coordination with the COMSEC Custodians/Managers of the four other TSA COMSEC Accounts at TSA HQ Intel, TSA FAMS, TTAC Annapolis Junction and Colorado Springs. Streamlining COMSEC and other Secure Communication procedures, and TSA-wide support is necessary for our three COMSEC Regional Managers to provide "Depot-Level" support and technical training to our users in TSA, and Mass Transit and Railroad users nationwide. The Secure Communications Branch, in conjunction with the TSA Office of Security Physical Security Division, is continuously evaluating existing and new requirements for all COMSEC within TSA HQ: the Federal Security Directors, their staffs, and SPOKE airports; and Mass Transit and Railroad customers. In order to improve the secure data communications infrastructure to support OIT and IAD, the Secure Communications Branch is reliant upon IAD
Page 15 of 19

and OIT for funding for the multiple HSDN Fly Await Units (classified laptop units with TALON cryptographic cards) to support IAD FISMA compliance for classified systems; critical Incident Response/Forensics exchange with National, Federal, Civil, DHS HQ and other DHS components. TSA is highly dependent on the Homeland Security Data Network Program Management Office for providing baseline Department System Security policy directives, procedures, and initial formal/informal training. Additionally, FY09/10 funding for the new Secure Mobile Environment Portable Electronic Device (SMD/PED) to support TSA HQ Senior Executives needs to be earmarked for equipment acquisition when the final requirements are known and the DHS HSDN PMO infrastructure has been implemented. Additional Activities for the Secure Communications team are as follows: ˇ Conduct HQ element data call to identify potential Mass Transit and Railroad COMSEC Users to be sponsored and implemented in FY09. Current data trend is not available on a consistent basis, making it extremely difficult to plan efficiently and target COMSEC assets to meet the changing operational and mission requirements within TSA HQ. Prepare a COMSEC requirements database with all new requirements stipulated along with the New Requirements Letters, clearance validation and Physical Security Certification letters for all specified deployment locations. Implement a new COMSEC Awareness Training Program on the On-line Learning Center (OLC). No formal COMSEC Training Program exists on OLC or within DHS Headquarters and any other DHS component. Develop and implement an interactive COMSEC Awareness Program. Develop and implement a TSA COMSEC System Security Plan and Local Operating Manual for the new Secure Mobile Environment-Personal Electronic Device (SME/PED to support the TSA Administrator and Deputy Administrator and potentially other TSA Senior Executives. The SME/PED system is currently being BETA tested with follow-on Security Test and Evaluation by the HSDN PMO and final system certification by the DHS HSAWG. Revise and update the TSA Cryptographic Modernization Plan to support upgrading existing desktop telephony and network encryption systems with new generation COMSEC cryptographic technologies. Current secure telephony and network encryptor technologies in use are coming to the end of their product life and cannot support new and expanded secure data, video teleconferencing, and voice requirements for the TSA HQ Administrator and his/her staff and field units. Implement new generation secure telephony, data, and network cryptographic units to support the strategic and operational requirements at TSA HQ, Freedom Center, and Site W. Obtain Final Operational Capability of the TSA HQ LMD/KP system as the central COMSEC accountability system, and migration of the NSA DIAS system.

CYBER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PLANNING (CCIP) SECTION Summary

The CCIP Section is responsible for ensuring TSA complies with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and meets the Sector Specific Agency (SSA) requirements identified in Homeland Security Presidential Directive ­ 7 (HSPD-7) and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) as they relate to cyber critical infrastructure for both the national Transportation Systems Sector and the Postal and Shipping Sector; two of the 18 National Critical Infrastructure Key Resources Sectors established to secure the infrastructure and assets vital to national security. The Cyber Critical Infrastructure and Planning Section is composed of two Branches: The Public Information Protection Branch and the Critical Infrastructure Sector Planning Branch. Below are detailed descriptions of each Branch's specific areas of responsibilities. 5.1.1 Summary of Public Information Protection Branch

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 significantly changed many aspects of information collection by the Federal government. The act requires agencies to plan for the development of new collections of information and the extension of ongoing collections well in advance of sending proposals to OMB. Agencies must: ˇ ˇ ˇ Seek public comment on proposed collections of information through "60-day notices" in the Federal Register; Certify to OMB that efforts have been made to reduce the burden of the collection on small businesses, local government and other small entities, and Have in place a process for independent review of information collection requests prior to submission to OMB.

The Public Information Protection Branch (PIP) works to assure TSA's compliance with the PRA Act of 1995. The Branch liaises with all of TSA and pertinent stakeholders outside the agency in order to assure agency compliance. The PIP Branch is a component of the Cyber Critical Infrastructure and Planning Section, Information Assurance Division (IAD), under the Office of Information Technology (OIT). Under PRA each agency must report to congress all information collections initiated, discontinued, and any violations of the mandated process identified within the Act. The PIP team must stay abreast of the requirements of Government Paperwork Reduction Act, compliance with section 508, provisions to protect the public's
Page 17 of 19

privacy, and other current and future mandates which impact the federal government's collection of information. 5.1.2 Summary of Critical Infrastructure Sector Planning Branch

The Critical Infrastructure Sector Planning (CISP) Branch is responsible for assuring TSA implements processes and fulfills SSA responsibilities as they relate t cyber critical infrastructure for both the TSS and the P&SS. CISP is a component of the Cyber Critical Infrastructure and Planning Section, IAD, under the Office of Information Technology (OIT). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Executive Order 13416 provide the basis for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsibilities in the protection of the Nation's Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR) and national cyber infrastructure. The strategic objective of CISP is to minimize the impact and consequences to the Nation's critical cyber infrastructure by developing and implementing protective programs and resiliency strategies for the TSS and the P&SS. To fulfill this responsibility it is CISP's role to lead TSA's cyber critical infrastructure initiatives, planning and coordination efforts to drive national infrastructure protection priorities. CISP as the cyber component of the designated SSA for the TS and the PS Sectors is responsible for developing and implementing a coordinated national approach to protect both sectors' critical cyber infrastructure. To accomplish this CISP must work within the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) guidelines, while developing baselines, analyzing, developing and implementing national level plans to accomplish Nation security goals. The CIPAC guidelines require agencies to work with Federal, State, local, and tribal governments, regional consortiums, private sector owners and operators of the nation's transportation systems and postal and shipping critical infrastructure assets, senior representatives of the other 16 national sectors, and related international interests. CISP must facilitate and coordinate initiatives relating to multiple sector issues through the formation of working groups under the Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) (private associations, owners and operators) and the Government Coordinating Council (GCC) (federal, state, local, and tribal governing representatives) adhering to CIPAC guidelines for these relationships. Working groups and subworking groups can range in size from 10 to 100's of members and have many complex interdependencies with other working groups and other sectors. 5.2 Primary Stakeholders and Interfaces of the Cyber Critical Infrastructure and Planning Section The CCIP Section supports all major programs within the TSA either though PRA responsibilities or cyber SSA responsibilities. The primary stakeholders within the TSA for cyber critical infrastructure are General Managers for the six (6) transportation modes and the PSS within TSNM, Global Strategies, and TSA's Office of Intelligence. Relationships with TSA all TSA program managers are critical to assure compliance with PRA.

SECTION B ญ SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS
B.1 Contract Line Items, Descriptions, and Ceilings CLIN 0001 SUPPLIES/SERVICES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY SUPPORT SERVICES Ordering Period: 60 months B.1.1 Contract Minimum/Maximum Quantity and Contract Value (a) The Government intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. (b) The minimum guarantee for the contract will be $3,419,600. (c) The specific services and quantities will be identified on each Order. Each Order will have its own CLIN structure, based on the requirements in the individual Order (d) A combined maximum ceiling of $190,000,000.00 is established as the cumulative total of all orders for the entire ordering period. B.2 General The Contractor shall provide, in accordance with issued Order (also noted herein as Task Orders [TOs], all management, supervision, labor, facilities, and materials necessary to provide security support services to TSA's projects and programs on an Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) basis. Orders may be issued on a Fixed Price (FP) and/or Time-and-Materials (T&M) basis. Orders will be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth herein. B.3 Orders Orders may be placed during the Ordering Period specified in Section B.1. However, there is no requirement for the Government to issue any Orders beyond the initial Order provided it exceeds the Minimum Guarantee and the Government is not required to place future Orders or exercise Options under Orders. This is not a multi-year contract within the meaning of FAR Part 17.1. Orders may be issued with performance periods up to twelve months and may reflect additional option periods. Orders may exceed twelve months in duration provided such issuance is consistent with applicable law, regulation and rules applicable to the funds appropriation cited in the Order. B.4 Contract Pricing B.4.1 Pricing Rates Applicable to Fixed Price and Time and Materials (T&M) Orders Orders issued on a FP or T&M basis shall be priced using the labor rates that do not exceed those specified in Section B.5, Pricing Rate Tables. The labor rates reflect the fully-burdened rates (including profit) for each labor category and apply to all direct labor hours. UNIT (U.S. Dollars) UNIT PRICE MAX AMOUNT $190,000,000.00

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 3 of 96

(a) Labor. The labor rates in Section B.5 are fully-burdened hourly rates for each skill classification and apply to all direct labor hours. The fully-burdened labor rates include all direct, indirect, general and administrative costs and profit associated with providing the required skill. The fullyburdened labor rates include all labor and labor-related costs, such as, but not limited to, the following list of representative labor-related costs: salaries, wages, bonuses to include stock bonuses, incentive awards, employee stock options, stock appreciation rights, employee stock ownership plans, employee insurance, fringe benefits, contributions to pension, other post-retirement benefits, annuity, employee incentive compensation plans, incentive pay, shift differentials, overtime, vacation time, sick pay, holidays, and all other allowances that should be included in a comprehensive employee compensation plan. All hourly rates are based on a 40-hour work-week and standard work year of 1,920 hours per year. (1) Government Site Rates. These rates shall be used when contractor personnel are performing at Government sites or at other than the Contractor's own facility/site. The Government will provide only office space, furniture, and office equipment and supplies, as specified in the individual Orders. (2) Contractor Site Rates. These rates shall be used when contractor personnel are performing at the Contractor's own facility/site. The Contractor shall furnish all office space, supplies, materials and services required to perform the work. This includes, but is not limited to, telephones, faxes, copiers, personal computers, postage (to include courier services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, etc.), normal copying and reproduction costs. (3) Other Direct Costs. The Other Direct Costs (ODCs) are for order-related travel. The cost of general-purpose items required for the conduct of the Contractor's normal business operations will not be considered an allowable ODC in the performance of orders under this contract. Profit/fee is unallowable on ODCs. Only travel authorized in writing by the COTR prior to expenditure shall be reimbursed. Travel expenses shall be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations. (4) Program Management Support Costs. Contract-level program management support costs are included as a percentage of each individual labor category rate, and encompass support for contract-level management, reporting requirements and related travel and meeting attendance costs associated with the Contractor's program management staff, as it relates to overall management of the contract. As a result, these program management support costs are allocated across all of the task orders issued under this contract. These "program management" support costs are differentiated from individual task order "Task Order Manager" or "Project Manager" support costs, which are billed as hourly labor rates against individual task orders for direct support to the effort performed under those task orders. This will result in direct billings at the task order level for labor hours in the "Task Order Manager" or "Project Manager" categories, to specifically support project management for the task order.

B.4.1.1 Fixed Price Task Orders (TOs) For FP type TOs, the quantity of each item or labor category ordered will be multiplied against the rate listed in this schedule or as negotiated for the TO, and the cumulative extended total of all items

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 4 of 96

ordered will define the fixed price of the TO. Travel, if applicable, may be estimated for each TO. Any total rate negotiated for travel and ODCs will be added to the extended price of all ordered items to arrive at the total fixed price of the TO B.4.1.2 T&M Task Orders (TOs) For T&M type TOs, the quantity of hours ordered from each labor category will be specified as deliverable hours billable at the ceiling rates specified in the Section B.5 Pricing Rate Tables or as negotiated, if lower rates are proposed for the TO. ODCs will be estimated for each TO. The cumulative extended total of all labor categories ordered plus ODCs will define the TO ceiling price. The government will not reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred beyond the ceiling price, for hours not delivered, for hours delivered but in excess of the quantities ordered for a particular labor category or for ODCs exceeding authorized amounts. For hours ordered but not delivered, the Government may issue a unilateral modification to the order that reduces the price of the order and deobligates funds from the order in proportion to the number of hours ordered but not delivered. B.4.1.3 Rate Refreshment (a) The labor rates are fixed for all contract year periods; however, the Contractor may submit a proposal reducing the fixed labor rates and escalation rates at any time during the life of this contract. The Government will review these proposals and determine if the revised rates are realistic and in the best interest of the Government. If the rates are accepted, the Government will modify the contract by incorporating the new rates into the Section B.5 Pricing Rate Tables. B.5 Pricing Rate Tables The Pricing Rate Tables (next page) provide labor category descriptions and labor rates for performance of the requirements that will be specified in individual Orders. Fully loaded hourly labor rates are included for each labor category both at the Contractor site and at Government sites. These fullyloaded hourly labor rates are the ceiling rates representing the maximum rates allowable for Prime Contractors and Subcontractors. Additional labor categories may be proposed as part of the Offeror's proposal. Offerors shall explain in their proposal why adding the labor category is in the best interest of the Government. Also, for additional proposed labor categories, Offerors shall describe the minimum knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience that the Offeror requires of employees and subcontractors.
B.5 PRICING RATE TABLES

The following table provides guidelines for establishing the labor rates required by the template includedthis section:

Template Instructions: For Labor Rates Table, create a row for each proposed labor category. Refer to Attachment D "TSA Labor Categories" for a listing of the minimum categories that shall be addressed in the labor rate table. If the Offeror is proposing LCATs that are in addition to those shown in Attachment D to this RFP, a new row shall be added to this table to indicate the required information. Use as many rows as necessary; one row for each labor category (LCAT). Enter data as indicated in column heading or cross-reference the proposal page on which the required information may be found. If the Offeror wishes to use different Labor Categories to meet the requirement of the IDIQ then the Offeror must crosswalk the Offeror's Labor Categories to the Government Proposed Labor Categories in Attachment D. Additionally, the Offeror may propose additional labor categories not listed in Attachment D if deemed necessary to perform the contract. For each additional labor category proposed that is not crosswalked to a labor category in Attachment D, Offerors shall explain in their proposal why adding the labor category is in the best interest of the Government. Also, for additional proposed labor categories, Offerors shall describe the minimum knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience that the Offeror requires of employees and subcontractors. Note that the prices of additional labor categories proposed by the Offeror that do not crosswalk to a labor category in Attachment D of this RFP will not be evaluated as part of the total evaluated price.

G.2

Authority of Government Contracting Officials The authority and roles of the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative are as follows: Contracting Officer: Mary F. Hallam, mary.hallam@dhs.gov, 571-227-2998 The Contracting Officer has the overall and primary responsibility for the administration of this contract. Only the Contracting Officer has authority to enter into, administer, or terminate this contract on behalf of the Government. This includes modifying and deviating from the contract terms, conditions, requirement, specifications, and delivery schedules; making final decisions involving such matters as invoice payments or other consideration due to the Government for nonperformance or unsatisfactory performance, interpreting the contract, and resolving disputes; and, terminating the contract for default or convenience. The Contracting Officer also has authority to delegate certain responsibilities to an authorized Government representative. Contract Requirement Modification The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract. Notwithstanding any clauses contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. Any changes made by the contractor at the direction of any person other than the contracting officer will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the order price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result of the change. Delegation of Contract Administration Authority The Contracting Officer may designate, in writing, representatives to perform functions required to administer this contract, however, any implied or expressed actions taken by those representatives must be within the limits cited within the Contracting Officer's written designations. If any individual alleges to be a representative of the contracting officer and the contractor has not received a copy of the document designating that representative's authority, the contractor shall refrain from acting upon the representative's requirements and immediately contact the contracting officer to obtain a copy of the document designating that individual as a representative of the Contracting Officer.

Contract Specialist: Kristin S. Fuller, Kristin.fuller@dhs.gov , 571-227-2740 The Contract Specialist will assist the Contracting Officer with the tasks and details associated with the pre-award and post-award phases of the contract. The Contract Specialist does not have authority to alter the contractor's obligations or to change the contract specifications, price, terms, or conditions. Contracting Officer's Technical Representative: (To be inserted at time of award) Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR): The Contracting Officer will appoint individuals to act as authorized representatives in the monitoring and administration of this contract. This individual is designated in writing as a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), with a copy to the Contractor. An individual designated as a COTR is authorized to perform the following functions and those functions in accordance with COTR appointment letter: (1) Coordinate the technical aspects of this contract and inspect all required services. (2) Certify, accept and reject invoices deemed improper for payment for the services and/or supplies rendered and allowed under the terms and conditions of this contract. (3) Designate various individuals to assist in monitoring the performance of the contract. Such persons are not official COTRs, are NOT authorized representatives of the Contracting Officer. The COTR responsibility still remains with the COTR designated by the Contracting Officer for that given area. The COTR will represent the Contracting Officer in the administration of technical details within the scope of this contract. The COTR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the order. The COTR is not otherwise authorized to make any representations or commitments of any kind on behalf of the Contracting Officer or the Government. The COTR does not have authority to alter the contractor's obligations or to change the contract specifications, price, terms or conditions. If, as a result of technical discussions, it is desirable to modify contract obligations or the statement of work, changes will be issued in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer. The Government may change the COTR assignment at any time without prior notice to the contractor. The contractor will be notified of the change. G.3 Contractor's Program Manager The contractor's designated Program Manager (PM) for this Contract is: To be inserted at time of award The Contractor shall provide a Program Manager for this contract that has the authority to make any no-cost contract technical, hiring and dismissal decisions, or special arrangement

Observance of such holidays by Government personnel shall not be a reason for the Contractor to request an extension of the period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract. In the event the Contractor's personnel work during the holiday, they may be reimbursed by the Contractor, however, no form of holiday or other premium compensation will be reimbursed either as a direct or indirect cost, other than their normal compensation for the time worked. This provision does not preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work if applicable to this contract. When the Government grants excused absence to its employees in a specific location, assigned Contractor personnel at that same location may also be dismissed at the discretion of the contractor. If Contractor personnel are dismissed, the Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. G.5 Payment Schedule A payment schedule will be specified in each Order.

G.6

Travel and Per Diem On occasion, a contractor may be required to travel outside of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area to fulfill the requirements of the Government. A normal man year equals approximately 1920 hours of labor, thus 160 hours per month. Each type of position stipulates an estimated percentage of travel per month. For example, if a labor category states Travel = 5%, this would equate to this particular contractor traveling an estimated 1 day per month. Travel is defined as going beyond the 50 mile radius of the employee's designated duty location. On occasion, a contractor may be required to travel outside of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area to fulfill the requirements of the Government. In cases like this, travel expenses and per diem costs will be paid for by the Government in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations. Reimbursement for travel will be authorized as a separately priced Other Direct Cost (ODC) line item. All travel must be approved in advance by the COTR. The Information Assurance Division (IAD) has multiple staff contracts supporting the office. In the instance where contractors from various contracts need to take travel together, every effort will be made on behalf of the contractor to maximize cost efficiencies. An example of this would be that in the event Contractor A and Contractor B (from separate contracts) take a business trip, the Government would expect that they would share a rental car to minimize the costs to the Government.

H.11 INTERRELATIONSHIP OF ASSOCIATE CONTRACTORS The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other Contractors (i.e., "Associate Contractors") in order to provide information technology requirements separate from the work to be performed under this order, yet having links and interfaces to this order. The Contractor may be required to coordinate with other such Contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interfaces and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other Contractor(s) for the purpose of such work. Where the Contractor and an associate Contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each Contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant Contracting Officer and furnish the Contractor's recommendations for a solution. The Contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the Contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the Contracting Officer or because of failure to implement Contracting Officer directions. Where the Contractor and Associate Contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both Contractors, a

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

This disclosure shall include a mitigation plan describing actions the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict. Changes in the Contractor's relationships due to mergers, consolidations or any unanticipated circumstances may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest which may necessitate such disclosure. The TSA reserves the right to review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed after award, and to reject mitigation plans if the OCI, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer cannot be avoided, or mitigated.

H.12.3 Contract Termination for OCI The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

H.20.4 Disclosure of Technology to Non-Immigrant Alien Disclosure of source code, technology, or documentation to a nonimmigrant alien, a type of foreign national not authorized access may be considered to be an export and export control violation by TSA. The contractor shall at all time comply with Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. parts 120 through 130, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In complying with these export provisions, the contractor shall determine the applicability of license exemptions; exceptions and obtain appropriate licenses or other approvals for exports of source code, technology, and documentation. The contractor shall make the same determinations where its use of non-immigrant aliens would allow them access to export sensitive information. Acquisitions involving foreign nationals or foreign entities are subject to the following provisions: H.20.5 Use of Non-Immigrant Aliens and Non-US Companies The contractor shall submit an explanation to the TSA contracting officer of why use of the nonimmigrant alien would not violate export restrictions. The contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the license and license exemption or exception. Copies of export related determinations and documentation shall be provided to TSA upon request. For export or security reasons, TSA reserves the right to exclude Offerors with a controlling degree of non U.S. ownership, and non U.S. place of business or nonimmigrant aliens from being given access to software, equipment, technology or documentation necessary to prepare an offer or to perform the contract. Offerors shall be aware that obtaining an export clearance license may still be outweighed by security concerns. Any potential Offeror either having or intending to make significant use of, non US companies or personnel that are nonimmigrant aliens is encourage to consult the TSA contracting officer prior to committing resources. This clause shall flow down to subcontractors. H.21 SBU DATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION The contractor must satisfy requirements to work with and safeguard Sensitive Security Information (SSI), and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). All support personnel must understand and rigorously follow DHS and TSA requirements, policies, and procedures for safeguarding SSI and PII. Contractor personnel will be required to complete online training for SSI and Informational Security, which take one hour each, as well as TSA online Privacy training. The Contractor, and those operating on its behalf, shall adhere to the requirements of the nondisclosure agreement unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall be responsible for the security of (i) all data that is generated by the contractor on behalf of the TSA, (ii) TSA data transmitted by the contractor, and ( iii) TSA data otherwise stored or processed by the contractor, regardless of who owns or controls the underlying systems while that data is under the contractor's control. Users of TSA IT assets shall adhere to all system security requirements to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation of information under their control. All users accessing

The TSA information security policy is an operational implementation and extension of the DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A, Version 5, March 1, 2007. DHS 4300A provides general policy in a wide variety of areas and provides guidance to DHS Organizational Elements (OEs) for the establishment of operational policy within the OEs. DHS 4300A takes precedence in instances where there is conflict between it and TSA MD 1400.3 that is not otherwise resolved by TSA MD 1400.3, Attachment 1, Security Policy ญ DHS Bridge. Note that the TSA MD 1400.3 addresses additional details relating to security policies, personnel security, data encryption, and more. The Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR) serves as a supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The OCIO/OCISO/IT Security Office currently complies with FAR and HSAR related statements, to include "Contractor Employee Access". In addition to the above referenced HSAR document, the "TSA MD 2800.71 - Pre-employment Investigation Standard for TSA Employees and Contractors" document also references and addresses:  SSI  FOUO  Sensitive Information  Information Technology Resources,  Background checks/analysis and administrative processes together with CO, COTR and CSO,  Sensitive information training, computer access agreement (CAA) and security orientation briefing (are performed by the IT Security's Security Awareness, Training and Education Program) for prime or subcontractors,

To reemphasize, the below referenced requirements can be found on pages, 2-2, 4-1 & 4-2, 52-1, 52-3, 52-4, 52-5, 52-6 and 52-7 of the HSAR. As indicated, the OCIO/OCISO/IT Security is in total compliance to this requirement. H.23.5 Privacy or Security Safeguards (a) The Contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the Contracting Officer's written consent, the details of any safeguards either designed or developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise provided by the Government. (b) To the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to safeguard against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government data, the Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor's facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases. (c) If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the Government or the Contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party. (d) The Contractor shall not be eligible for any award fee for any evaluation period in which there is a breach of privacy or security. Lost award fee due to a major breach of privacy or security may not be allocated to future evaluation periods. (e) The award fee authority fee authority shall determine whether a security or privacy breach is categorized as a major security or privacy breach. To ensure that any potential final award fee evaluation at contract completion reflects any breach of privacy or security, in an interim period, the overall award fee pool shall be reduced by the amount of the fee available for the period in which the major breach occurred if a zero fee determination was made because of a major breach of privacy or security.

H.24 MAJOR BREACH OF SAFETY OR SECURITY H.24.1 Safety Breach Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to TSA and is a material part of this contract. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any "willful" or "repeat" violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan. H.24.2 Security Breach Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of classified information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000. NOTE: Breach of Security for the purposes of this definition shall not be confused with breach of security in screening operations.

H.28 SECURITY OF SYSTEMS HANDLING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND PRIVACY INCIDENT REPONSE (a) Definitions. "Breach" (may be used interchangeably with "Privacy Incident') as used in this clause means the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 42 of 96

access, or any similar situation where persons other than authorized users, and for other than authorized purpose, have access or potential access to Personally Identifiable Information, in usable form whether physical or electronic. "Personally Identifiable Information (PII)" as used in this clause means any information that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly inferred, including any other information that is linked or linkable to that individual regardless of whether the individual is a citizen of the United States, legal permanent resident, or a visitor to the United States. Examples of PII include: name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number, Social Security Number (SSN), email address, zip code, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers including license plates, uniform resource locators (URLs), Internet protocol addresses, biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints), photographic facial images, or any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information where it is reasonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to identify the individual. "Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (Sensitive PII)" as used in this clause is a subset of Personally Identifiable Information, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. , Complete social security numbers (SSN), alien registration numbers (A-number) and biometric identifiers (such as fingerprint, voiceprint, or iris scan) are considered Sensitive PII even if they are not coupled with additional PII. Additional examples include any groupings of information that contains an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements: (1) Driver's license number, passport number, or truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits) (2) Date of birth (month, day, and year) (3) Citizenship or immigration status (4) Financial information such as account numbers or Electronic Funds Transfer Information (5) Medical Information (6) System authentication information such as mother's maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN) Other Personally Identifiable information may be "sensitive" depending on its context, such as a list of employees with less than satisfactory performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. In contrast, a business card or public telephone directory of agency employees contains Personally Identifiable Information but it is not sensitive. Sensitive PII have higher impact ratings for purposes of privacy incident handling. (b) Systems Access. Work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of Sensitive PII. The contractor shall provide the Government access to, and information regarding its systems, when requested by the Government, as part of its responsibility to ensure compliance with security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Government in assuring compliance with such requirements. Government access shall include independent validation testing of controls, system

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 43 of 96

penetration testing by the Government, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) data reviews, and access by agency Inspectors General for its reviews. (c) Systems Security. In performing its duties related to management, operation, and/or access of systems containing Sensitive PII under this contract, the contractor, its employees and subcontractors shall comply with applicable security requirements described in DHS Sensitive System Publication 4300A or any replacement publication and rules of conduct as described in TSA MD 3700.4 In addition, use of contractor-owned laptops or other media storage devices to process or store PII is prohibited under this contract until the contractor provides, and the contracting officer in coordination with CISO approves, written certification by the contractor that the following requirements are met: (1) Laptops employ encryption using a NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 or successor approved product; (2) The contractor has developed and implemented a process to ensure that security and other applications software are kept current; (3) Mobile computing devices utilize anti-viral software and a host-based firewall mechanism; (4) When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be processed (i.e., sanitized, degaussed, or destroyed) in accordance with DHS security requirements. (5) The contractor shall maintain an accurate inventory of devices used in the performance of this contract; (6) Contractor employee annual training and rules of conduct/behavior shall be developed, conducted/issued, and acknowledged by employees in writing. Training and rules of conduct shall address at minimum: (i) Authorized and official use; (ii) Prohibition against use of personally-owned equipment to process, access, or store Sensitive PII; (iii) Prohibition against access by unauthorized users and unauthorized use by authorized users; and (iv) Protection of Sensitive PII; (7) All Sensitive PII obtained under this contract shall be removed from contractorowned information technology assets upon termination or expiration of contractor work. Removal must be accomplished in accordance with DHS Sensitive System Publication 4300A, which the contracting officer will provide upon request. Certification of data removal will be performed by the contractor's Project Manager and written notification confirming certification will be delivered to the contracting officer within 15 days of termination/expiration of contractor work.

(d) Data Security. Contractor shall limit access to the data covered by this clause to those employees and subcontractors who require the information in order to perform their official duties under this contract. The contractor, contractor employees, and subcontractors must physically secure Sensitive PII when not in use and/or under the control of an authorized individual, and when in transit to prevent unauthorized access or loss. When Sensitive PII is no longer needed or required to be retained under applicable Government records retention policies, it must be destroyed through means that will make the Sensitive PII irretrievable. The contractor shall only use Sensitive PII obtained under this contract for purposes of the contract, and shall not collect or use such information for any other purpose without the prior written approval of the contracting officer. At expiration or termination of this contract, the contractor shall turn over all Sensitive PII obtained under the contract that is in its possession to the Government. (e) Breach Response. The contractor agrees that in the event of any actual or suspected breach of PII (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), it shall immediately, and in no event later than one hour of discovery, report the breach to the contracting officer, the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), and the TSA Director of Privacy Policy & Compliance (TSAprivacy@dhs.gov). The contractor is responsible for positively verifying that notification is received and acknowledged by at least one of the foregoing Government parties. (f) Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement. The contractor has in place procedures and the capability to promptly notify any individual whose Sensitive PII was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached, as determined appropriate. The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and subject to the prior approval of the Government, based upon a risk-based analysis conducted by the Government in accordance with DHS Privacy incident Handling Guidance. Notification shall not proceed unless the Government has determined that: (1) notification is appropriate; and (2) would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security. Subject to Government analysis of the breach and the terms of its instructions to the contractor regarding any resulting breach notification, a method of notification may include letters to affected individuals sent by first class mail, electronic means, or general public notice, as approved by the Government. At minimum, a notification shall include: (1) a brief description of how the breach occurred; (2) a description of the types of personal information involved in the breach; (3) a statement as to whether the information was encrypted or protected by other means; (4) steps an individual may take to protect themselves; (5) what the agency is doing, if anything, to investigate the breach, to mitigate losses, and to protect against any further breaches; and (6) point of contact information identifying who affected individuals may contact for further information. In the event that a PII breach occurs as a result of the violation of a term of this contract by the contractor or its employees, the contractor shall, as directed by the contracting officer and at no cost to the Government, take timely action to correct or mitigate the violation, which may include providing notification and/or other identity protection services to affected individuals for a period not to exceed 12 months from discovery of the breach. Should the Government elect to provide and/or

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 45 of 96

procure notification or identity protection services in response to a breach, the contractor will be responsible for reimbursing the Government for those expenses. (g) Pass-Through of Security Requirements to Subcontractors. The contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of this clause, its terms and requirements, in all subcontracts under this contract, and to require written subcontractor acknowledgement of same. Violation by a subcontractor of any provision set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor.

H.29 CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE ACCESS TO SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION (SSI). Work under this contract may involve access to Sensitive Security Information (SSI) by contractor employees. Access to SSI is restricted to covered persons with a need to know. As covered persons, contractor employees with access to SSI have a duty to protect SSI and therefore must adhere to the safeguarding procedures set forth in 49 CFR part 1520 and DHS Management Directive 11056.1. Moreover, contractor employees are required to follow the TSA SSI Office policies and procedures described in the attached SSI Quick Reference Guide. These safeguarding procedures include SSI recognition, restrictions on disclosure, storage, handling, sharing, dissemination, and destruction of SSI. Unauthorized disclosure of SSI is grounds for civil penalties or other corrective action. H.30 SEVERABILITY CLAUSE In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this agreement, but this agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been contained herein, unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would result in such a material change so as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated herein to be unreasonable.

In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved.

It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). (j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use.

HSAR 3052.209-72 Organizational Conflict of Interest (JUN 2006) (a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. (b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award. (c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: ___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or ___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision. (d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan. (e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. (f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision. (g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. (End of clause)

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ง6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

SECTION L ญ INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS
FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated By Reference (FEB 1998) This contract solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The Offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the Offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the Offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at these Internet addresses: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ http://www.arnet.gov FAR Provision No. 52.212-1 52.233-2 Title and Date Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items (JUN 2008) Service of Protest (SEP 2006)

52.216-1 Type of Contract (APR 1984) The Government contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract resulting from this solicitation.

Important: This is a Request for Proposal. This request does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation or the submission of any response to this request for proposal. DUE DATE: 30 August 2010, 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time Offerors shall demonstrate their expertise and understanding of the requirement by submitting a written proposal in response to the RFP. Offerors shall submit proposals in five (5) Volumes: Volume 1 ญญ Business Management Approach ญ IDIQ Volume 2 ญ Past Performance - IDIQ Volume 3 ญ Price (IDIQ Pricing) Volume 4 ญ Staffing Approach (Task Order #001) Volume 5 ญ Price (Task Order #001) Page limitations apply to Volumes 1 (30 pages), 2 (3 pages) and 4 (30 pages), as specified below.

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 77 of 96

Proposals must demonstrate the Offeror's capability and understanding of the requirement as well as its ability to successfully complete the effort as stated in this RFP. Except as otherwise specified, proposals must be submitted electronically in files compatible with the following Microsoft Office products: Word 2007 and Excel 2007; Along with other submissions required by this RFP, Offerors must submit completed and signed RFP Section A , responses to RFP Section K , and completed and signed Task Order # 0001 SF1449; portions of the submissions that require signature may be submitted electronically in Adobe-compatible PDF files. Proposals must not include marketing brochures, company procedure manuals, handbooks or guides, or other information that is not specifically required by the RFP. Any material of this nature will not be evaluated and will be disregarded. Inclusion of such materials may be construed as indicative of the Offeror's inability to follow instructions and, therefore, unable to perform, which may render the Offeror non-responsive and may be cause for rejection of the Offer. Proposals must contain complete and substantiated data that is comprehensive, concise, and factual. General statements that the Offeror understands the requirements and simple rephrasing and restatement of the Government's requirements, will not be considered adequate responses to the RFP. Similarly, submittals containing omissions or incomplete responses to the requirements of this RFP, or that merely paraphrase the description, specifications, Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement, or Attachments included in this RFP, or that use non-specific phrases such as "in accordance with standard procedures" or "well-known techniques" will also be considered inadequate. Responses of this kind may render the Offeror non-responsive and may be cause for rejection of the Offer. The Government will review proposals for responsiveness and completeness, making sure that each Offeror provided the information required by this RFP. A proposal that does not conform to the format and page requirements, or does not respond to the technical requirements of this RFP, or does not contain sufficient information to be evaluated may be determined unacceptable and not evaluated further. In this case, the Contracting Officer will then notify the Offeror that its proposal was determined to be unacceptable and provide a FAR compliant pre-award debriefing. The Government intends to award, without discussions, one IDIQ contract to the Offeror whose proposal is deemed to offer the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered (see SECTION M, Evaluation Factors for Award) or to make no contract award. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Accordingly, the Government reserves the rights to award the contract to [i] other than the Offeror with the lowest-priced technically-acceptable Offeror, and [ii] other than the Offeror with the highest technical score. The Government will evaluate the proposals received in two phases. The first phase will evaluate the Offeror's Business Management Approach (Volume 1), Past Performance (Volume 2) and Price (Volume 3) at the IDIQ level, based on the requirements found only in the IDIQ Statement of Work. Phase 1 will be a best value determination where Business Management Approach is more important than Past Performance, and Past Performance is more important than Price. The Government will rate the non price factors using adjectival rating (Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Unacceptable), except for Past Performance which will be rated as Acceptable, Neutral, or Unacceptable.

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 78 of 96

Only the Offerors submitting responses which received an evaluated score of "Acceptable," "Good," or "Outstanding" in each volume under this Phase 1 will be further evaluated in Phase 2 on their Staffing Approach (Volume 4) and Price ญ Task Order #001 (Volume 5). Phase 2 responses will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. Offerors who do not receive an "Acceptable," "Good," or "Outstanding" score in Phase 1 and are therefore not eligible for evaluation in Phase 2 will be notified in writing by the Contracting Officer.

PHASE 1 ญ Basic IDIQ
L.1 VOLUME 1 ญ BUSINESS MANAGEMENT APPROACH INSTRUCTIONS
Offerors shall submit a response of not more than 30 pages for Volume 1. Volume 1 ("Business Management Approach") shall describe the Business Management approach for performing all of the requirements specified in the IDIQ Statement of Work, including managing the Contractorprovided resources across TSA and future Delivery Orders that may be issued under the IDIQ contract. Subsection 1 - Technical Approach ญ The Technical Approach shall be complete, detailed and specific so as to reflect the Offerors' ability to meet the requirements defined in TSA's IDIQ Statements of Work. The Offeror shall demonstrate corporate experience and capability (i.e., resources, facilities, people, and tools) to deliver IT Security Support services across the OIT organization (TSA). The Offeror shall provide a plan describing its (1) realignment of personnel in response to changing/fluctuating workload within OIT, and (2) ability to temporarily increase staffing to respond to emergent or technically challenging assignments. The technical solution/approach for the overall project shall explain in detail the Offeror's quality and extent to which the proposed solution will achieve TSA objectives. The proposal shall explain in detail that the Offeror's solution adheres to sound practices, provides a realistic approach, reflects an in-depth understanding of the Information Technology Security Division's objectives, environment, constraints as defined in the Statement of Work, and is customer/stakeholder focused.

L.2 VOLUME 2ญ PAST PERFORMANCE
Offerors' Volume 2 proposals shall be limited to 3 pages (not including Attachment F Past Performance Questionnaire), and shall include a description of three (3) examples of the Offerors' past performance as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor for contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to the requirements of this solicitation. The past performance examples shall be for contracts or subcontracts performed within the last three years from the date of this solicitation. If an offeror lacks a record of relevant past performance within the last three years, or if an offeror has fewer than three examples of relevant past performance within the last three years, the offeror shall state such clearly in the Volume 2 proposal. The Offeror shall utilize the format noted below in Table L1 to provide past performance information. Offerors shall submit copy of the Past Performance Questionnaire (see Attachment F) to each Program Manager and Contracting Officer at the firms listed by the Offeror as a reference. The firms listed by the Offeror as a reference shall submit the completed questionnaire via email to: ITSSSinfo@dhs.gov, as instructed in Attachment F. The Offeror shall not submit any other documents in addition to the Past Performance Questionnaire and the information required by this solicitation in Table 1. Submission of additional past performance-related documents may render the Offeror's entire proposal submission non-responsive, and no portion of the Offeror's submission will be evaluated. TSA may contact an Offeror's references during the evaluation process to verify relevant experience and level of performance. The TSA may, at its discretion, obtain and evaluate information from sources other than those provided by the Offeror. For all past performance information, please ensure that the company provides current, names of points of contact, e-mail addresses, telephone, and fax numbers are current. The Government will not make repeated efforts to contact the references if the information is incorrect. The Offeror shall also notify the references that their names have been submitted to TSA and that TSA will be contacting them.

L.3.5.1 Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest
a. Policy It is the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) policy to award contracts to only those Offerors whose objectivity is not impaired because of any related past, present or planned interest, financial or otherwise, in organizations regulated by TSA or in organizations whose interests may be substantially affected by Agency activities. Based upon this policy, a conflict of interest may arise when the successful Offeror has: ท Previously performed work for TSA and is awarded this contract. This situation will arise when the successful Offeror previously designed, developed, tested, or recommended IT systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and components thereof) that are now in use at TSA. It is likely that under this contract, the successful Offeror will monitor and provide advice to the Government regarding the efficacy of the various IT systems currently in use at TSA, and the needs for updates and/or replacements to these systems. Knowledge under the immediate contract with the intent of using this knowledge to compete for future TSA contracts. To avoid this situation, TSA will require the successful Offeror to sign an agreement to refrain from participating in any future TSA contract in which that Offeror gained an unfair competitive advantage by receiving insight into TSA's acquisition strategies, plans, budgets and funding or from assessing the weaknesses, strengths and efficacies of TSA's IT systems and future IT systems requirements.

ท

Accordingly, as part of its proposal, Offerors are required to identify any real or potential conflict of interest for adjudication by the Contracting Officer; these conflicts shall be identified for

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 83 of 96

In addition, Offerors are required to include in the proposal a definitive statement that reads substantively as follows: In consideration of receiving award of a contract as a result of responding to this solicitation, the following companies agree that, should one or more of these companies become privy to any advance information regarding TSA's future IT systems requirements, acquisition strategies, plans, budgets, and funding and TSA solicits a contract based on any of this information, the undersigned companies will refrain from participating in that (those) resulting TSA contracts. The above statement must be signed by the appropriate executives of each company that is a principal contracting party and by each subcontractor that is expected to receive subcontracts in excess of $550,000 during the life of this contract; the typewritten name, title, company name; address, DUNS number and CAGE number must accompany each signature. For this paragraph, an appropriate executive is one who has the authority to act for and contractually bind his/her company. The Offeror shall provide a statement in its proposal which describes in a concise manner all past, present, or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an organization regulated by TSA or with an organization whose interests may be substantially affected by Agency activities, and which is related to the work under this solicitation. The interest(s) described shall include those of the Offeror, its affiliates, proposed consultants, proposed subcontractors and key personnel of any of the above. Past interest shall be limited to within one year of the date of the Offeror's technical proposal. Key personnel shall include any person owning more than 20% interest in the Offeror's corporate entity, and the Offeror's corporate officers, its senior managers and any employee who is responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a regulated or affected organization. a.

c.

Contracting Officer Review

The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the Offeror. All such information, and any other relevant information known to TSA, will be used to determine whether an award to the Offeror may create a conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may: ท Disqualify the Offeror, or ท Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the Offeror and include appropriate means to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. d. Refusal to Certify, Misrepresentations, Discovery of Conflict of Interest

The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information required, may result in disqualification of the Offeror for award. If non-disclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If after award the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to the contract awarded as a result of this solicitation, which could not reasonably have been known prior to award, an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. The disclosure shall include a full description of the conflict, a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflict. The Contracting Officer may, however, terminate the contract for convenience at no cost if he or she deems that termination is in the best interest of the Government. The following is a listing of OIT contracts that may pose potential conflicts of interest and that the prime contractor(s) and their subcontractor(s) are advised to fully consider prior to submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1 Solicitation Provisions
FAR Provision No. 52.217-5 Title and Date Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) (applicable to Task Order # 001)

Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Full Text The following provision is hereby incorporated in full text: 52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1 Business Management Approach Subfactor: Technical Approach Subfactor: Quality Control Factor 2: Past Performance Factor 3: Price - IDIQ Factor 4: Staffing Approach--Task Order # 001 Factor 5: Price - Task Order # 001 Factor 1 Business Management Approach and Factor 2 Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Within Factor 1, Subfactor Technical Approach is more important than Subfactor Quality Control. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision)

M.2 Basis of Award
The Government intends to award a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The Government may: ท ท ท Waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received; Seek proposal clarifications with one or more Offerors without entering discussions and without requesting Final Proposal Revisions; May establish a competitive range (see M.2.1 below) and conduct written or oral communications with those Offerors only to; determine that other than the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal represents the best value to the Government and, therefore, award a contract to other than the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer; Reject any or all submittals and make no award, if such action is deemed to be in the Government's best interests; and Evaluate proposals and award a contract based upon:   Initial proposals without communications or Initial or subsequent proposals with communications.

ท ท

Accordingly, Offerors are advised that their response to this solicitation shall contain the Offeror's best terms and conditions. A written award or acceptance of Offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the Offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the Offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an Offer (or part of an Offer) in writing, whether or not there are communications after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Communications conducted after receipt of an Offer do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. The Government may disclose the following information in post-award debriefings to other Offerors: ท ท ท The Source Selection Authority's decision; The Offeror's evaluated standings relative to the successful Offeror(s); and A summary of the evaluation findings relating to the Offeror.

M.2.1 Competitive Range Per FAR Part 15, a competitive range will be established if in the best interest of the Government. The competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria stated in solicitation Section M, un-

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 93 of 96

less the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency. After evaluating all proposals, the contracting officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals (including a price analysis) that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted.

M.3 Evaluation Factors
The first phase will evaluate the Offeror's Business Management Approach (Volume 1), Past Performance (Volume 2) and Price (Volume 3) at the IDIQ level, based on the requirements found only in the IDIQ Statement of Work. Phase 1 will be a best value determination where Factor 1--Business Management Approach is more important than Factor 2--Past Performance, and Factor 2--Past Performance is more important than Factor 3--Price - IDIQ. The Government will rate the non price factors using adjectival rating (Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Unacceptable), except for Past Performance which will be rated as Acceptable, Neutral, or Unacceptable. Only the Offerors submitting responses which received an evaluated score of "Acceptable," "Good," or "Outstanding" in each volume under this Phase 1 will be further evaluated in Phase 2 on Factor 4--Staffing Approach (Volume 4) and Factor 5--Price ญ Task Order #001 (Volume 5). Phase 2 responses will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis, and Factor 4--Staffing Approach will be more important than Factor 5--Price ญ Task Order #001. Offerors who do not receive an "Acceptable," "Good," or "Outstanding" score in Phase 1 and are therefore not eligible for evaluation in Phase 2 will be notified in writing by the Contracting Officer.

M.4 Evaluation Factor Details ญ Phase 1
M.4.1 Order of Importance TSA intends to award a single-award IDIQ to the responsive and responsible firm whose proposal demonstrates the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered in Phase 1. Within Phase 1, Factor 1--Business Management Approach is more important than Factor 2--Past Performance. Within Factor 1--Business Management Approach, Subfactor 1-Technical Approach is more important than Subfactor 2--Quality Control. . Factor 2--Past Performance is more important than Factor 3--Price - IDIQ. All non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 3--Price - IDIQ. However, as the technical merits of competing proposal approach equal, Factor 3--Price - IDIQ will become more important in any trade-off decisions. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal.

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 94 of 96

M.4.2 Factor 1--Business Management Approach The Government shall evaluate each Offeror's approach and ability to meet the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will rate this factor using adjectival rating (Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Unacceptable). The Government shall assess the sub-factors noted below (noted in order of importance) to determine each Offeror's capability to manage, resource, and control the services provided on the ITSSS contract over a five-year contract performance period. If the Offeror is found Unacceptable in either (or both) subfactors, they will receive an Unacceptable for their overall Business Management Approach. An Offeror receiving an Unacceptable for this factor will no longer be considered for evaluation in Phase 2. Subfactor 1 - Technical Approach The Government shall evaluate the Offeror's ability to meet the requirements defined in TSA's IDIQ Statements of Work. The Government shall evaluate the Offeror's demonstrated corporate experience and capability (i.e., resources, facilities, people, and tools) to deliver IT Security Support services across the organization (TSA). The Government shall evaluate the Offeror's plan to realign personnel in response to changing/fluctuating workload within TSA, ability to temporarily increase staffing to respond to emergent or technically challenging assignments. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's solution on how it will adhere to sound practices, provides a realistic approach, reflects an in-depth understanding of the Information Technology Security Division's objectives, environment, constraints as defined in the Statement of Work, and is customer/stakeholder focused. The Government will evaluate how the Offeror's approach demonstrates it knowledge, skills, and abilities to fulfill the solicitation's requirements in a realistic manner. The Government will also evaluate the Offeror's ability to clearly crosswalk the Government provided Labor Categories and Descriptions to the Offeror's proposed Labor Categories and descriptions. If the Offeror has proposed additional labor categories beyond those outlined in Attachment D to this solicitation, the Government will evaluate the benefits and/or risks of potentially adding this Labor Category to the IDIQ.

Subfactor 2 - Quality Control TSA shall evaluate that the Offeror has a system of quality control that provides: ท ท Prompt response and resolution to government requests, questions and concerns. Prompt notification to the Government of problems, failure to meet contract requirements and other concerns or suggestions that will enhance service and/or reduce cost.

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552 ท

ท

monitoring and tracking of issues, and processes or methods to remedy the quality of service being provided. The TSA will evaluate the quality assurance plan to ascertain the Offeror's ability to meet the requirements defined in the TSA SOW and the criteria listed above Prevention of the recurrence of quality issues or concerns

M.4.3 Factor 2--Past Performance Offerors' proposals will be evaluated to determine whether or not the Offeror possesses a record of satisfactory past performance for requirements of similar size, scope, and complexity to the requirements of this solicitation. In conducting this evaluation, the TSA will contact the references identified in Offerors' proposals and will use the questionnaire included as Attachment F to this solicitation. Offerors' proposals will be evaluated as either "Acceptable", "Unacceptable", or "Neutral" for this evaluation factor. A rating of "Neutral" will be assigned where an Offeror lacks a record of relevant past performance. A rating of "Unacceptable" will result in an Offer no longer being considered for Phase 2 evaluation. The TSA will evaluate past performance on the basis of all past performance examples included in the Offeror's proposal. In addition, the TSA may consider information obtained from other sources in evaluating past performance. M.4.4 Factor 3--Price ญ IDIQ The Contracting Officer will review each Offeror's rates proposed for inclusion in the labor rate tables of the IDIQ contract. The Contracting Officer will review whether these rates are fair and reasonable. Note that the prices of additional labor categories proposed by the Offeror that do not crosswalk to a labor category in Attachment D of this RFP will not be evaluated as part of the total evaluated price. Since adequate price competition is anticipated, price reasonableness will be determined by comparing the Price Proposals received in response to the solicitation. Proposed rates that are deemed unreasonable or unsupported may result in rejection of the proposal and removal of the Offeror from further consideration.

M.5 Evaluation Factor Details ญ Phase 2
M.5.1 Order of Importance Within Phase 2, Factor 4--Staffing Approach ญ Task Order #001 is more important than Factor 5--Price ญ Task Order #001. The non price factor will be rated using ratings of Acceptable/Unacceptable. M.5.2 Factor 4--Staffing Approach--Task Order # 001 TSA shall evaluate the Offeror's staffing approach to perform IT security support services within Task Order #001.

HSTS03-10-R-CIO552

Page 96 of 96

TSA shall evaluate the resumes submitted for each of the key positions. The Offeror shall submit 2 copies of the resume for each Key position--1 copy with the individual's name redacted, and one unredacted version. Redacted names shall not be readable in any format. The resumes will be evaluated on skill sets and experience level for all personnel proposed for this contractual effort, relative to the minimum qualifications specified in the IDIQ Statement of Work for each key position. For persons proposed to fill Key Personnel Positions, the offeror shall provide a Letter of Commitment demonstrating that the individual proposed will be assigned to the contract immediately upon award and will abide by the terms and conditions of the Key Personnel Clause included in Section H of the contract. Should the offeror propose an individual for a key position that is not an employee of the prime or subcontract at time of proposal submittal, in addition to the Letter of Commitment, the offeror shall include a Contingent Hire Letter demonstrating that the employer (prime or subcontractor) and the proposed individual have reached agreement on salary and any non monetary compensation. The Government will evaluate how the Offeror will staff to perform IT security support services required in the attached Task Order #001 Statement of Work (SOW) through their Labor Resource Table. This Table will evaluate the proposed labor mix and proposed level of effort to rate the Offeror's ability to adequately comprehend the staffing requirements. TSA will evaluate labor mix by assessing the appropriateness of resources assigned to deliverables and work products by considering labor categories and levels of effort. TSA will evaluate the staff experience for relevance, currency, and coverage. M.5.3 Factor 5--Price - Task Order # 0001 The Contracting Officer will review the proposed prices and basis of estimates for performing the Statements of Work in the Base Year and all Option Years for Task Order #0001 to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable by considering the appropriateness of labor categories, labor mix, skill levels, and level of effort. All Items for Task Order # 0001 will be evaluated and summed to create a single "Total Evaluated Price" for each proposal evaluated. Proposals/basis of estimates that are deemed inadequate or demonstrate a lack of understanding of the Government's requirements (including inadequacy of proposed hours or inadequate labor mix to perform the work) or lack sufficient detail for evaluation may result in rejection of the proposal and removal of the Offeror from further evaluation. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

10. TECHNICAL DIRECTION PROCEDURES

   Notwithstanding the Contractor’s responsibility for total management responsibility during the performance of this Task Order, the
   administration of this Task Order will require maximum coordination between the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the
   Contractor. The following individuals will be the TSA's points of contact during the performance of the contract:
  .
  .
  . Contracting Officer (CO):


     . The Administering CO for this Task Order is: Kristin S. Fuller, TSA Office of Acquisitions, Phone: 571-227-2740, E-mail:
       Kristin.fuller@dhs.gov.


     . The TSA Contracting Officer (CO) identified above, has the overall responsibility for this Task Order. The CO alone, without delegation,
       is authorized to take actions on behalf of the Government to amend, modify or deviate from the contract terms, conditions, and
       requirements.

     . No oral statement by any person, or written statement by anyone other than the Contracting Officer, or his or her authorized
       representative acting within the scope of his or her authority, shall be interpreted as modifying the terms and conditions of this Task
       Order. The CO may delegate certain other responsibilities to his/her authorized representatives or Contracting Officer Technical
       Representative (COTR).


  . Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR):


     . The COTR for this Task Order is:  To be determined at time of award


     . The COTR has the authority to monitor the technical progress of the supplies, services, or construction that is required to be delivered
       and or performed under the Task Order.  This includes visits to contractor's plant or the place of performance, meetings and telephone
       conversations with contractor personnel, inspection, acceptance, or rejection of the contracted items and other duties that maybe
       authorized by the CO. The COTR cannot authorize or order the cessation of neither contract work nor delete, change, or waive any of the
       technical requirements or other terms and conditions of the Work Order. The COTR will be the Contractor’s main point of contact for all
       supplies and services ordered under this Task Order.

     . The COTR is authorized to provide technical direction for the provision of services under this Task Order.  The COTR shall provide
       technical direction to the Contractor in writing with a copy to the CO. The Contractor shall not accept orders for work to be performed
       by any other official other than the COTR or CO. In the event that work is performed without authorization by the delegated officials,
       the incurred cost will be the sole responsibility of the Contractor and is not billable to the Government. Should a need for a change
       (monetary or otherwise) arise under the Task Order, the contractor must submit a written request to the CO for consideration.  If
       appropriate, the change will be effected by a Task Order modification, after discussions and/or negotiations.  Whenever a difference of
       opinion between the contractor and the COTR occurs, notify the CO immediately for resolution.  Contractors should also contact the CO
       when unable to contact the COTR on a technical matter and for assistance on all other matters pertaining to this Task Order.
