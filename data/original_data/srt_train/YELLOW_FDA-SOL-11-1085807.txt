The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements,
other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate/commercial plan that is more
extensive.

Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or
offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  “SUBCONTRACT,” as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-
employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor requesting supplies or services required for
performance of the contract or subcontract.

If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the OPDIV Small Business Specialist (SBS) at (301)-827-1994, the Office of
Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300, or visit the OSDBU website (http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/staff.html). Also,
sources may be obtained through the Central Contractor Registration (http://www.ccr.gov/) website.

Please note that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has subcontracting goals of 19.5% for small business (SB), 5.00% for
small disadvantaged business (SDB), 5.00% for women-owned business (WOSB), 3.00% for HubZone business (HUBZone) and 3.00% service disabled
veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for fiscal year 2011.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed subcontracting plans to
contain the following small business goals, a minimum, 19.5% for total SB, 5.00 % for SDB, 5.00% for WOSB, 3.00% for HubZone and 3.00% for
SDVOSB concerns.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars. The offeror is required to
include an explanation for a category that has zero as a goal.

   1. Type of Plan (check one)


       Individual plan (all elements developed specifically for this contract and applicable for the full term of this contract).
       Master plan (goals developed for this contract) all other elements standardized and approved by a lead agency Federal Official; must be
      renewed every three years and contractor must provide copy of lead agency approval.
       Commercial products/service plan (goals are negotiated with the initial agency on a company-wide basis rather than for individual
      contracts) this plan applies to the entire production of commercial service or items or a portion thereof. The contractor sells commercial
      products and services customarily used for non-government purposes.  The plan is effective during the offeror’s fiscal year.  The
      contractor must provide a copy of the initial agency approval and must enter an annual SSR into the electronic Subcontracting Reporting
      System (eSRS) with a breakout of subcontracting prorated for HHS and other Federal agencies.

8.  Timely Payments to Subcontractors

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your
subcontracts with small business concerns, 8(a), SDB, women-owned small business, HubZone and service disabled veteran-owned small business
concerns.

Your company has established and used such procedures:   yes /  no

9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, 8(a), small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone small and service disabled veteran owned concerns as
subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make
a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that
liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, SDB,
WOSB, HubZone and SDVOSB small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with
the contracting official prior to approval of the plan.

Background:
The Center for Drug Evaluation & Research (CDER) has formed a Computational Science Center (CSC).  This group has been developed to support CDER
decisions by:
    • Defining the requirements for and ensuring development of the IT infrastructure needed to enable 21st century computing operations,
    • Building technical expertise to enhance CDER’s capabilities to use modern scientific computing tools to advance the science of safety at
      every stage of the drug life cycle,
    • Driving change through key projects to develop and implement needed data standards, increase electronic submissions and access to
      electronic data, and
    • Providing and expanding use of electronic review tools and measuring their impact and value. 
The implementation of Empirica Study / WebSDM within CDER has now fallen under the umbrella of the CSC.  CSC is currently anticipating more SDTM
(Standard Data Tabulation Model) submissions being sent to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is interested in a more comprehensive roll-
out, support plan and training plan for the Empirica Study / WebSDM toolset.

1. Objectives:

Objectives of this Statement of Work are 1) to obtain services for operation and maintenance of the Empirica Study/WebSDM software (application
and database) in all three environments (test/training, production, development), 2) to evaluate, determine and execute roll-out strategies for
those staff who receive SDTM submissions, 3) evaluate, develop and conduct training, and 4) provide all levels of application support to the end-
users.  Additionally, due to the non-traditional statistical methodologies being integrated into the software, other objectives include, 5)
providing the FDA with the program codes, and full documentation of all non-traditional statistical methodologies and data in order for the FDA
to assess and review the methods and codes for their correctness and value to the FDA.  In addition to using the WebSDM/Empirica Study software
as it is publicly released, FDA may request enhancements to the software.  Efforts such as this may require FDA-specific system configuration
and/or application re-deployment.

Specific objectives of these requirements are listed below.

     1. Provide project management support to implement the objectives defined in this statement of work.  Artifacts shall include standard
        project management and enterprise project lifecycle (EPLC) documentation as defined on Page 4, Section 4.1.2 below.
     2. Provide on-demand phone and/or on-site local application support for end-users with immediate needs.
     3. Identify, troubleshoot and propose resolutions of data errors in SDTM submissions that are processed with the Empirica Study / WebSDM
        software.  Resolve data errors after FDA approval of changes.
     4. Provide technical and application support for all other questions, problems, issues and work that address basic to complex application
        questions, software & database patching, application and database trouble-shooting, maintenance and upgrades for test, development and
        production environments at FDA.
     5. Evaluate, develop and implement Empirica Study / WebSDM Study training.  Training evaluation, development and implementation shall
        involve potential and current users of Empirica Study / WebSDM including, but not limited to statisticians, safety reviewers, medical
        reviewers and support staff.  Training shall be offered in multiple formats that may include, but is not limited to, hands-on classroom,
        clinics, webinars, and on-demand web-based short video. Training shall cover all levels of complexity from beginner to advanced level
        for each discipline.
     6. Evaluate, develop and implement roll-out plan for increased usage of Empirica Study /WebSDM toolset.
     7. Develop manuals, best practices, and how-to guides for support staff.
     8. Knowledge transfer through documentation or regularly scheduled meetings to ensure uniform support from contractor and FDA support
        staff.
     9. Participate in FDA-managed change control board for software version control, patching, and enhancements.
    10. Provide program codes and documentation (e.g., preprints/reprints of manuscripts) for all non-traditional statistical methodologies.
    11. Conduct meetings with FDA staff, including, but not limited to, medical, statistical, clinical microbiology and clinical pharmacology
        staff to discuss improvements and/or corrections to methodologies and associated program codes.
    12. Ensure that any methodologies, viewed unsatisfactory by FDA, have the ability to be turned off or disabled within the application.
    13. Enhancements.

2. Scope

The scope of the project focuses on the implementation, support, and maintenance of the Empirica Study/WebSDM environments (test/training,
development, and production) including database and application, development and implementation of targeted training for the use and support of
the application, support to the end-users of the application for the FDA, information sharing and validation of non-traditional statistical
methodologies, and enhancements.

The Contractor is required to have the ability to provide all services under the contract. The Contractor shall provide the required materials
and services, and otherwise meet all requirements for, or incident to, the performance of the work as described below. The Government reserves
the right to furnish equipment and/or facilities and shall be set forth in the individual task orders

This contract will be comprised of a base contract with four option years, and a separate IDIQ portion for some specialized training,
documentation and enhancements.

     1. System Overview and Design Perspective


   The current implementations of Empirica Study/WebSDM application is the 3.0 version, build 186 (3.0.186), and runs on Windows 2003, 64-bit,
   along with R and IIS.  The database is running on a Windows 2003, 64-bit server with Oracle 10gR2 (10.2.0.4).


   The design of the Empirica Study / WebSDM application follows a standard 2-tier application design (Figure 1).  The application tier contains
   both web and application software.  It represents those aspects of the application that allow a user to interact with the application and its
   data and contains all of the application code that implements the business logic.  The data tier contains all of the data storage in addition
   to the logic required to effectively organize and index that data, as well as the code needed to provide access to the data via the
   application layer.


   The Empirica Study / WebSDM application runs in three distinct, separate hardware environments. There is a PRODUCTION environment, a combined
   TEST/TRAINING environment, and a development environment that serves specific needs for performing data transformation, analysis via Empirica
   Study / WebSDM and connectivity directly to Oracle database.  The technical architecture of each environment is represented in Figure 1 below.
