Do you require a Dual CPU or Single CPU solutions?

The requirement is for the specified PCU.

   1. Also 3 DIMM Configurations cannot achieve 4GB.  You would have to chose between 3GB and 6GB.

The requirement is for 4GB of RAM or more of RAM.  The 3 DIMM Configuration is only a preference, not a hard requirement.

   2. Is there any consideration given to vendors for using Enterprise level Hard Drives that have a higher duty cycle then standard desktop hard
      drives?

 No, standard duty is all that is required.

   3. Are you planning to do simple or high end video output from these units?

We plan to use the full capabilities of the specified graphics card

   4. Is the area where you plan to install them cooled or is it just a normal user operation room?"  Thanks for your help.

Pcâs will be located in an air conditioned control room.

   5. Would your customer want 8gb of RAM on both units?  The reason is that the Data Acquisition from the new interment controls can easily
      exceed the 4ram limit, and this will also provide smoother data collection.

Requirement is for 4GB or more for CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0002.  8GB for both units would meet this requirement.

   6. Does the customer have a motherboard spec?  We plan to list high end gaming motherboards on the spec to  meet video processing needs, but
      we fear we will be over $600 per unit hire due to this.

Not specifically, but it needs to be compatible with the components specified.

   7. Would the customer except dual hard drives or a network hard dive unit?  The 500gb and 1tb units will slow down the PC during the data
      collection and the primary hard dive should only be around 250gb or less for best performance.  A secondary hard drive or storage unit
      would provide better storage capabilities and backups.

Answer re dual drives: Yes, as long as the total stroage meets that specified.

Answer re network drives: No, not interested in a network drive.
