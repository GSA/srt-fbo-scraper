Introduction

Purpose

The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to identify milestones to develop, test and deploy an application built upon a SharePoint platform to manage and track the assignment and tracking of work assignments within the agency. 



Background

Initial requirements and business process modeling began in September 2008 with the award of a contract termed the “Seeds of Change”. That project helped the agency to understand the scope and magnitude of the work necessary to actually build the automation envisioned in that process. All of the deliverables under that project are attached to this SOW to provide the highest level of visibility to potential bidders for this current requirement. They include:

A Project Plan

A Requirements Specification

A Project Management Plan

A Responsibility Assignment Matrix

A Concept of Operations

A Requirements Traceability Matrix

A Requirements Strategy



These project artifacts have been reviewed by the government and are generally in alignment with the objectives of the project. The government has taken the opportunity to leverage this work for the overall benefit of the agency and bundled it together with the intent of expanding upon the initial work and leveraging it for additional segments of the agency. As such there are a few instances in which information indicated in an attachment may be in conflict with Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 of this SOW. Where such conflicts exist this SOW shall be the authority by which the proposal should be based. 





The mission of FNS is to provide children and needy families better access to food and a more healthful diet through its food assistance programs and comprehensive nutrition education efforts.



This investment supports the FNS mission by increasing the operational efficiency of the agency though a decrease in the cost of one of the administrative functions that must be performed to conduct business. This investment also supports the mission of the agency by creating a tool that will be used as one of the sources for managing knowledge (KM) within the agency.  



Current Environment

The current process for managing work assignments is extremely manual. Email and Word processing software are the only productivity tools currently being used by the FNS team. In addition, the assignment tracking process consists of a log used to indicate when an assignment comes in and out of SNP. The challenge for FNS is that there are many possible paths for a specific assignment to travel and the expertise for responding quickly to requests is limited to more experienced staff members. The manual nature of the current process introduces several risks that have become increasingly difficult to manage because of the volume and speed of the process. The critical risks are: simultaneous editing of one document; response speed not matching expectations; access to past content is difficult; and inability to easily balance workload. 



Many types of assignments go through the agency for review, e.g., reports to Congress, internal correspondence, and messages intended for external audiences. Each assignment is subject to a process of review to ensure that the content to be delivered is factually accurate and in alignment with the policies of the agency. The time that it takes for a person to read and consider the content is accepted as a given for this project, however, it is likely that maintaining an assignment history will speed up research and analysis activities. In addition, the work behind generating copies, identifying the order of review, tracking changes and locating and identifying the status of any single package are all processes that will be positively impacted by introducing automation.



In a typical month, an office within the agency will handle about 30 uniquely assigned items with a response timeline of anywhere from hours to two weeks. Each assignment will contain several associated draft responses as well as supporting text, spreadsheet, graphic documents.  Please see the attached artifacts and the Activity Diagrams, Use Cases and other documentation attached to this SOW for a more granular examination of the processes for the Divisions operating under the Associate Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs (AASNP). 



Scope

The work identified through this SOW represents a mix of both technical development work and high-contact change management. The agency is intentionally not engaging a ‘Big Bang’ approach to this functionality. There is reasonable, but manageable risk in terms of meeting the technical requirements. As such confidence is high that the functionality that meets the requirements will be built. Whether that functionality gets used or not is of much higher risk and consequence. FNS has born witness to similar applications that have all the functionality but lack use. It is paramount that the functionality that is delivered under this SOW is regarded by the line-level personnel within the agency as both efficient AND useful. For that reason there is a lot of interaction between business areas like SNP and SNAP and the contractor to demonstrate that the functionality to be developed will meet their specific needs. After that functionality has been developed a similar amount of effort shall be employed to demonstrate how the delivered functionality does meet their business needs. 



The technical scope of these requirements is to build an Assignment Tracking application for use within the agency. The first segment of work will be to develop this functionality for the AASNP. That initial effort is expected to be the most difficult since it represents the first time the agency will be performing that type of work. Provided that work goes well optional work will be programmed which includes the development of the same scope of functionality for the Divisions under the Associate Administrator of Supplemental Nutrition. Provided that work goes well optional work will also be programmed to deliver the same scope of functionality to the balance of the agency and CNPP. 





Objectives

There are four objectives to this Statement of Work (SOW)

The Base achieves deployment for SNP and includes Quality Assurance sessions, Build Iterations and UAT. It also includes development of web-based training as well as 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support.

Optional Task 1 is to deploy for SNAP and includes Requirements Gathering Sessions, QA Sessions, Build Iterations and UAT. It also includes 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support. 

Optional Task 2 will focus on the remaining offices in FNS and the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. This phase includes Requirements Gathering Sessions, QA Sessions, a Build Iteration UAT. It also includes 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support.

Optional Task 3 is to provide Technical Assistance to the agency for the continued maintenance of the SharePoint workflow and components of the application.



Minimum Application Functionality Features/Requirements

The application shall automate and speed up the review process and allow for balancing workload across people and divisions.  More specifically, the application shall:

Eliminate the need to manually log and store a request or response draft.

Provide comments electronically to improve tracking, overlapping comment resolution and transmission of changes.

Consider concurrent reviews versus a single path review process.

Assign a resource based on one interaction between the Office and the Division, then route within the application. 

Allow for reassignment of an assignment if the initial person is out of the office or has too many assignments (load balancing).

Provide the flexibility for the reviewer to assign the next reviewer or return the assignment back to the originator with comments.

Provide a way for an authorized user to mark an assignment as high priority or expedite.  The elevated status must be conspicuous to the initial assignee to spur immediate response action.

The application shall improve process controls. The intent of this core requirement is to reduce the potential for errors and minimize the likelihood of missing activity deadlines.  More specifically, the application shall:

Notify assignee source of receipt and timeline for response.

Clearly define who must take action on an assigned request and under what timeline.

Clearly define who has ownership to edit an assignment at any given time.

Provide immediate visibility into who has ownership of a specific assignment at any given time and where it is in the review process (to be assigned, assigned to assignee, draft review, final review).

Establish automatic reminder or alerts to assignees and reviewers when deadlines are approaching or responses have not be handled.

Provide a mechanism for searching past responses by topic to increase consistency in response content and style.

Establish pre-defined response templates that can be automatically applied based on the type of assignment.

Upon entry of an external tracking number validate that another assignment package doesn’t include the same tracking number.  The goal is to prevent the creation of two assignments meant to address the same request.

If a duplicate assignment is discovered after a draft has been initiated, an authorized user needs to be able to close the duplicate and append information to the surviving assignment.

The application shall eliminate the need to print documents unless required by the current FNS Records Management Standards.  More specifically, the application will:

Eliminate the need to print assignments that arrives at SNP in electronic format.

Minimize the need to print a response draft for review and storage.

Tasks

As identified in Section 2.0, this SOW is comprised of two distinct sets of Tasks. Task 1 includes the base work of Phase 1 deploying products to the Divisions under the AASNP. It also includes and Optional Phase 2 deploying products to Divisions under the AASNAP. Finally it includes Optional Phase 3 deploying products to the balance of the Agency and CNPP. Task 2 is dedicated to providing technical assistance to the FNS Office of Information Technology for the maintenance of the workflow components and processes within the application. 



Task 1 Phased Development and Deployment

Because of work initiated and completed under a separate project Phase 1 actually gets a head start. The Requirements Gathering Sessions which are included in Optional Phases 2 and 3 were completed under that previous work and are represented in the Attachments at the end of this SOW. It is important that the contractor understands the process identified in this SOW and one step ahead of the business at all times. Thus the contractor will come to the first Quality Assurance Session not with a blank piece of paper, but rather with a complete understanding of the Requirements work that preceded it. This project is not starting from zero, it is building upon work from the Seeds of Change project as well as each activity in Task 1 builds upon the previous activities. 



Phase 1 achieves deployment for SNP and includes 5 Quality Assurance sessions at 16 days each, 3 Build Iterations and 1 UAT at 26 days each. It also includes development of web-based training as well as 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support. The contractor will deliver a Project Plan identifying the schedule upon initiation of the Phase. 



Optional Phase 2 is to deploy for SNAP and includes 5 Requirements Gathering Sessions at 17 days each, 5 QA Sessions at 16 days each, 2 Build Iterations and 1 UAT at 26 Days each. It also includes 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support. The contractor will deliver a Project Plan identifying the schedule upon initiation of the Phase.



Optional Phase 3 will focus on the remaining offices in FNS and the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. This phase includes 5 Requirements Gathering Sessions at 17 days each, 5 QA Sessions at 16 days each, 1 Build Iteration and 1 UAT at 26 Days each. It also includes 2 traditional training sessions and 1 month of help-desk support. The contractor will deliver a Project Plan identifying the schedule upon initiation of the Phase.

Requirements Gathering Session 

Requirements Gathering Sessions (RGS) are the building blocks for success in this type of project. It is vital that the right stakeholders participate in the RGS and it is equally important that momentum is sustained throughout the overall process. Optional Phases 2 and 3 both include an approach to RGS that mirrors what the government has found to be successful in the past. Each RGS is built upon a 17 day turnaround and each phase that includes this component has five of them. This is essentially a two-week cycle with three days for delivering the meeting minutes. 

It is imperative that the RGS achieve consensus in the baseline business process and the benchmark business process. To achieve this the contractor should focus on using Activity Diagrams, Use Case Models and Use Case Narratives to identify the Normal Flow and as many as is reasonable Alternate Flows. The contractor shall build upon the Requirements Traceability Matrix to identify nuance requirements that are important to the segment of the Agency that identified it.

The contractor shall also update and revise the Concept of Operations document to reflect the changing state of the application and the business needs. Each meeting will include an Agenda as well as a Read-Ahead Package (RAP) to ensure efficient progress. Each meeting will finish with the delivery of Meeting Notes identifying discussions that transpired during the meeting and assigning any action items to people. The contractor will facilitate these meetings. 

Quality Assurance Sessions

Quality Assurance (QA) Sessions are where requirements turn into detailed design. It is in this phase that the contractor will receive the standard type of documents which shall be turned into templates, and where the pro-forma workflows will be identified and reviewed. Essentially all information that is necessary to build the product is captured in this phase and it is reflected to the stakeholder team for verification. Each QA sprint is expected to be 16 days which is one day less than the RGS because the actual creation of documentation is expected to be less. The contractor will receive documentation and sanitize it so that it may be leveraged as a template. The contractor will also work to document the standard work flows for work correspondence that are predictable. 

It is important that the contractor use the information gathered from these sessions to identify the Validation Approach in the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM). It is also important that the workflow for standard correspondence is documented in Microsoft Visio or another standard modeling tool. Finally the standard templates shall be delivered and marked as final. 



Each meeting will include an Agenda as well as a Read-Ahead Package (RAP) to ensure efficient progress. Each meeting will finish with the delivery of Meeting Notes identifying discussions that transpired during the meeting and assigning any action items to people. The contractor will facilitate these meetings.

Build Iterations

Build Iterations are exactly what they seem to be, they are fully functional iterations of the application. Each Build sprint is expected to be about 26 days, or just short of a month. It is expected that the functionality in each build will represent a logical grouping of functionality as a function for the number of iterations in the phase. Thus in Phase 1 if the SNP team identifies 12 templates and 12 standard workflows each Iteration should include 4 complete templates and 4 complete workflows since there are three iterations. This divides the functionality into thirds. If the Optional Phase 2 is engaged, the functionality shall be divided into half since there are 2 Iterations programmed for the phase. Finally all of the templates and workflow will be built in the single iteration for Optional Phase 3 if it is engaged. 



The rationale for segmenting the functionality in this manner is because it is expected that the contractor and the government will grow more efficient with this process by performing it regularly. As such the government expects to achieve some efficiencies through the redundant nature of the process. 



For each iteration the contractor shall facilitate a walkthrough meeting in which the functionality that has been delivered is demonstrated to the user community. The contractor will also deliver the Iteration Test Plan which is a step by step walkthrough of the functionality in the iteration and allows the user community to make notes and comments regarding how that functionality can be improved and made more useable or error-free. The contractor shall work to correct all errors and increase usability. Comments that are delivered within 5 business days of the Iteration walkthrough shall be included in the subsequent iteration or the product delivered for UAT in the event it is the final iteration for that Phase. 



Each meeting will include an Agenda as well as a Read-Ahead Package (RAP) to ensure efficient progress. Each meeting will finish with the delivery of Meeting Notes identifying discussions that transpired during the meeting and assigning any action items to people. The contractor will facilitate these meetings.

User Acceptance Testing

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final point in which the government makes the decision regarding whether the functionality that has been delivered is able to be placed in the production environment. All outstanding comments to Iterations shall be addressed in the functionality delivered for UAT. The criteria for making this decision with respect to the binary decision about passing UAT will be the agreement that the Validation Approach for each requirement in the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) has been satisfied, the functionality is consistent with the templates and workflows documented in the QA Sessions and the application has no significant vulnerabilities as identified by the Information Security Office. 

In the Phase 1 build/UAT cycle web-based training will be delivered in conjunction with the start of the Testing period. This delivery will make the delivery of a Walkthrough of the complete functionality unnecessary for that Phase but for all other Optional Phases, if they are engaged, a walkthrough, facilitated by the contractor, for the entire user base shall be required. The Testing period will commence with no less than 2 weeks for functional testing by the business. Following the successful completion of functional testing the application will undergo full penetration testing. Provided that has been successfully completed the contractor shall deliver an Installation and Configuration Guide that shall be a very detailed document including screen shots of each step in the process to build and configure the application in the FNS production environment. 



Each meeting (Optional Phases 2 and 3) will include an Agenda as well as a Read-Ahead Package (RAP) to ensure efficient progress. Each meeting will finish with the delivery of Meeting Notes identifying discussions that transpired during the meeting and assigning any action items to people. The contractor will facilitate these meetings.

Web-based Training 

Web-based Training (WBT) products will be developed for each distinct role type in the application. None of these products should exceed 10 minutes in length. Each should be delivered as a Windows Media Audio/Video file. It should use the application and include provide narration and optional close captions to walk the user through the functionality for how that role type interacts with the application. 

The government will not be providing hardware or software to meet this requirement. It is expected that common applications like Camtasia or Flash should be used to develop these short videos with only a slight burden to the contractor. The deliverable shall be compliant with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

Training Sessions 

The contractor shall hold two training sessions at FNS to demonstrate the complete functionality of the application for each Phase. Any FNS employee may attend the training session and the training session will be broadcast through Live Meeting to employees not stationed in Park Center. The contractor shall run through the functionality of the application in less than 1 hour and the contractor will spend the balance of the training session answering questions and demonstrating the functionality of the application. No training session shall exceed four hours in length. The contractor is required to hold two training sessions per Phase, the contractor must schedule the training sessions to be at least a week apart so that employees who were on vacation or travel for a week have an opportunity to participate at the next event. 

Help Desk Support

The contractor shall begin to provide Help Desk support on the day the application is launched. That support shall last for 30 calendar days. The contractor is not required to provide support on Saturday’s or Sundays or on any other day in which the government is closed or it is not a normal workday, e.g. a holiday. The contractor will focus on providing assistance to the Divisions under the Associate Administrator who was the primary stakeholder for the Phase. However in Phases 2 or 3, users from a Phase already in production may also ask for an receive one-on-one assistance with use of the application. Additionally the contractor shall check in with the key stakeholders to solicit feedback and be proactive about getting people to use the application. 



Any bugs or errors detected during this month-long phase shall be documented and remediated at no additional cost to the government. 



The contractor shall also use this month to provide guidance to the regular Tier 1 Help Desk which provides support to the agency in the types of trouble calls and the frequently asked questions and answers. The contractor will also interface at least two times during this period to provide coaching to the Application Development Branch in OIT regarding strategies for providing Tier 2 Help Desk support. 



Optional Task 2 Technical Assistance

Outside of the month-long help-desk support term FNS will be maintaining the application. FNS may exercise this optional task to acquire guidance and insight into the maintenance of the application and the components of the application. The government has a well-qualified team of developers onsite. However SharePoint represents a new platform and opportunity to provide value to the rest of the agency. Exercising this task will allow the contractor not to perform the work, but rather to mentor the FNS team as they perform the work of maintaining the application. The contractor will identify approaches that have been or are likely to be successful for addressing issues. The contractor will work to help the FNS team better understand and diagnose problems. The contractor will offer constructive criticism and recommend or provide additional instruction or training on the intricacies of the platform so that the government will be able to maintain this application internally.

1 CORRESPONDENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  SPECIFICATION 
Revision Number 1.0 Date 11/12/2008 Description This version represents the first official version of the Requirements Specification.

1.1

Introduction 

The Office of Special Nutrition Programs (SNP) within the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) receives a large volume of inquiries and communications from external sources that require a consistent, timely and well formulated response. The communication may arrive from an individual citizen, a public official or an advocacy group. Regardless, the response must be well researched, documented and reviewed by the appropriate experts and executives before it is delivered. Depending on the context, the timeline for a response can range from hours to weeks. The current process for managing correspondence is extremely manual. Word processing software is the only productivity tool currently being used by the FNS team. In addition, the correspondence tracking process consists of a paper log sheet used to indicate when a response comes in and out of the Office of Special Nutrition Programs. The challenge for FNS is that there are many possible paths for a specific correspondence to travel and most the expertise on the process for responding is maintained in the heads of experienced staff members. The manual nature of the current correspondence system introduces several risks that have become increasingly difficult to manage because of the volume and speed of the correspondence flow. The critical risks are: simultaneous editing of one document; response speed not matching expectations; access to past content is difficult; and inability to easily balance workload.

1.2

Purpose   

The goal of the Seeds of Change project is to increase the operational efficiency and effectiveness of correspondence management by automating the process by which incoming communications are received, reviewed and answered. The investment in this automated system supports the FNS mission by decreasing the cost associated with one of the administrative functions that must be performed to conduct business and deliver on the Agency's core mission. In the current non-automated process, there are four critical deficiencies that must be addressed. First, there are situations in which two people may be electronically editing a document at the same time which results in a loss of work from one of those editors. Second, the speed and efficiency in which the review process moves is not always in alignment with the needs of the correspondence. A key need with regard to efficiency is bring greater visibility into the status of a response at any given time in the process. Third, with the introduction of new people into the SNP culture, it is more important to create mechanisms that allow the agency to retain and have quick access to past content that is similar to or related to current correspondence needs. Finally, SNP needs some way of reassigning and balancing work load when someone is out of the office or unable to meet the requirements of the review process. The development of an automated system to support the correspondence process will also provide the ability for remote access editing and tracking, should someone on travel need to work off-site.

1.3

Scope   

The focus of this system will be the correspondence process being managed by SNP. More specifically, it will handle the external correspondence flowing in and out of the Food Distribution, Child Nutrition and

Women, Infant and Children Divisions. The current business process will be automated to deliver on opportunities to increase effectiveness and mitigate risks. The new system will not manage requests for information submitted under the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, it will not govern how correspondence is tracked and managed beyond the Office of the Associate Administrator for FNS or out in the Regional offices.

1.4

Policy   

The implementation of a Correspondence Management System to automate and improve the current process will not drive any changes to existing SNP business policies. With the initial implementation of the system, SNP will operate under a "print and file" records management system, which is the current FNS standard. Under this standard, the initial correspondence received and the final, signed response will be printed and filed in a file cabinet. The interim drafts and supporting documentation will be managed as "work product" as specified under the "print and file" standard. The requirements specified in the subsequent sections of this document, however, will request that the developed system will provide the flexibility to interface with an electronic records management system in the future.

1.5

System Description   

The new Correspondence Management System (CMS) for NSP will manage the work flow associated with receiving, assigning, writing, reviewing, approving and responding to an external correspondence. The CMS will have users classified as writers, process managers, reviewers, and signatories (those with final sign-off). The users will interact with the system locally or through a remote access mechanism while out of the office. The initial implementation of the system will support approximately 150 users with the likelihood of approximately 20 to 30 concurrent users. In a typical month, SNP will handle about 30 correspondence items with a response timeline of anywhere from hours to two weeks. Each correspondence package will contain several associated draft responses as well as supporting text, spreadsheet, graphic documents. In general, the CMS will be built on a Microsoft Windows-based client server platform with an Internet Explorer 7 browser standard. The system will be thin client and will support both local and remote users. The remote access will be governed by two-factor authentication and user credentials will be managed through Microsoft Active Directory. The CMS will be classified as an FNS General Support System (GSS), which will drive the processes associated with daily backups, and power and network connectivity for the hosted application.

2 ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS   
2.1 Assumptions   
This section contains the baseline assumptions for the site development. 2.1.1 Relational Data Structures  As much as is possible, data structures shall be fully normalized and organized in a reasonable manner. 2.1.2 Transportability of Data  The application data must be portable to other systems to facilitate future system upgrades and changes. Portability does not include to alternative operating system platforms. While these changes are not known at the time, the developer is expected to keep data in a format that may be accessed by known components today for export/import into future systems. 2.1.3 Modular System Design  Content is expected to be properly identified and stored in a reasonable fashion. The system will need to keep application, template and content data separated in storage to improve maintainability. 2.1.4 Scalability  It is expected that the initial application will be deployed to the current USDA staff for an undetermined period of trial. Based on the success of the trial period, the application may be deployed for a larger user base. This level of expansion will require the application to be scalable beyond a single SNP/Division/Section/Branch organizational structure. The software and the final detailed design will need to detail and provide for this potential expansion. 2.1.5 Administration  Since this is not a customer facing application it is expected that the application is the administrative interface. The developer should not need to build administration specific tools for such tasks as archival and data re-loading ­ these are expected to be done by a system administrator using existing platform tools (i.e. ­ MS-SQL Server tools). 2.1.6 Future Expansion (API, other systems)  The USDA may deploy record management systems around this application in the future. The application is a process management system that maintains status information and work product to support the production of a Response. The resulting response (as well as the incoming Correspondence) may need to be drawn from and saved to a third party record management system. To facilitate this, the system shall be capable of supporting an API set for data inputs (Correspondence, Package Items) and outputs (Finalized Response). These will not be a part of the initial deployment. The developer shall document these APIs for the USDA.

2.2

Constraints   

2.2.1 Client Side  2.2.1.1 FDCC Baseline  The application will be deployed to users with computers configured per the current FDCC (http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/index.cfm) requirements. This will limit the availability of certain applications and techniques that may be widely acceptable in the public sector. The developer will need to ensure the application doesn't require components or configurations in conflict with the FDCC standard. 2.2.1.2 Thin client 

All use cases shall be executable without the installation of special client-side applications.

2.2.1.3 Internet Explorer version 7  Other browsers may be used, but Internet Explorer version 7 is the expected baseline browser. 2.2.1.4 Remote Access  The USDA currently uses a Citrix SSL client with two-factor identification to facilitate remote user access to internal server resources. The developer will not need to build remote access tools for the client side. USDA staff is already maintaining the user base and remote access installation and policies. 2.2.1.5 Section 508 Disability Compliance   

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended, 29 U.S.C. Section 794d, requires that when federal agencies develop, procure, maintain or use electronic and information technology (IT), they must ensure that federal employees and members of the public with disabilities, have access to and use of information and data comparable to that available to non-disabled employees and members of the public unless meeting compliance standards would pose an undue burden. The application shall comply with Section 508 accessibility requirements.

2.2.2 Server Side  2.2.2.1 Windows Platform 

The USDA is predominantly a Microsoft Windows based client and server environment. The application shall be built to run on these resources without major modification.

2.2.2.2

Hosts Provided by USDA 

The hardware and software shall be maintained by USDA staff as GSS (General System Support) resources. The USDA staff will handle daily backups, provide power and network connectivity for the hosted application. Network security and access policies will also be managed by USDA staff. The application should not rely on services outside those specifically required in this document as they may not be accessible from the application server's network context. It should be reasonably assumed that resources specified in this document will be available to the application as "high availability" services (e.g. ­ Microsoft Active Directory).

2.2.2.3

Active Directory 

The USDA currently uses Microsoft Active Directory services for user credentials. The application shall interface with the current Active Directory system to obtain user validation information.

2.2.3 Development Tools  2.2.3.1 Onsite Development  All application configuration, code and content shall be stored and developed on USDA managed servers. The developer shall only use non-production content in the development environment. 2.2.3.2 Rational Suite  The following code development and management tools will be provided for the developer (for the USDA development environment): Rational RequisitePro (requirements/code management), Rational ClearCase (configuration/release management) and Rational ClearQuest (bug tracking). The developer shall maintain all application related work product with these tools. All work product shall be stored on USDA hosted equipment. 2.2.3.3 Style Guides  The application shall adhere to the guidelines specified in the USDA Web Style Guide (Full Reference in Appendix A). There may be some divergence from this standard provided the developer obtains USDA approval of the change and the reason for the divergence is documented. 2.2.3.4 Code Documentation  The developer shall provide three levels of documentation with the system: code level, user level and help desk level. Code level documentation shall follow the code documentation standard (Web Style Guide, Database Development Standard). User level documentation (User Manual Format) shall be described in detail all possible user interactions with the application. Help Desk level documentation (Operations Manual; Installation/Configuration Template) shall provide an in depth coverage of all the issues that may be encountered by the application support team. The USDA formats for these documents are referenced in Appendix A.

3 CONTEXT 
The CMS application will reside on servers hosted by the USDA as a GSS (General System Support) asset. The hardware will be on a private/switched LAN segment and may have other sibling network segments around it.

4 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS   
4.1.1 Process Requirements    Process Flow Diagram (numbers correspond to descriptions below)

4.1.1.1 Data Attributes ­ Inputs and Outputs  The application will take Correspondence documents as an initial input. These are scanned and saved as a PDF file. During the Response creation, review and approval process additional documents may be added to the Package. These may consist in a variety of formats and serve as supporting information for consideration during the Response drafting process. The final product of this process is a Response document. The Response document is a PDF file that gets archived and sent to the requestor as a final product. 4.1.1.2 High Level Logic  The application shall facilitate/automate the current manual process for Response preparation. A thumbnail sketch of the logic involved in the process would follow these lines: 1. The Process Manager receives Correspondence. 2. Based on the Correspondence origin and type, the Process Manager creates a Response package with a Response Type and Review Path. 3. The Process Manager assigns the highest level Reviewer. 4. The Process Manager assigns the Signatory.

5. 6. 7. 8. 9.

Reviewers along the Review Path assign the next Reviewer in the chain. The final reviewer assigns the Writer. The Writer creates or updates a Response The Writer marks the Response as Ready for Review. Reviewers examine the Response, comment and request changes. The review process works upward through the reviewer chain until it reaches the highest level Reviewer in the chain. The Writer may be asked to initiate revisions which will rewind the Review process back to the lowest in the chain. 10. After all Reviewers have approved the Response revisions, the Writer marks the Response as Ready for Final. 11. The review process works backward through the chain until it reaches the Signatory who either marks it as final or returns back down the review chain for changes. 12. The Process Manager delivers the Response in its final state to the entity generating the Correspondence. 4.1.1.3 Accesses to stored data  There are two ways data may be stored or accessed in the system. The first way would be as an administrative user through common operating system tools. This level of access does not directly access the detail of the data but rather the application data as a whole. The purpose for this access is primarily for data backup and restoration when needed. The second data access path would include all the editing options exposed by the application. The purpose for this path is to facilitate the application need for storage. 4.1.1.4 Data Flow  The application shall be responsible for establishing the details of the data flow to meet the requirements stated elsewhere in this document.

4.2

Site Data Requirements 

4.2.1 Loading Data  4.2.1.1 Initial Import  The application shall support an initial Site Data load process which will allow System Administrators to load data from a pre-formatted file. 4.2.1.2 Recovery  The application shall support data recovery at a Site Data level. The Site Data shall include all work product data associated with the application. Site Data recovery shall be possible from an un-initialized system to allow for a bare-metal restoration path. A recovery action shall only be deemed successful if all data has been restored and verified as correct in the running application. 4.2.2 Archiving Data  4.2.2.1 Response package Archival  The application shall provide tools and processes that will allow users to move specific Response packages to an archived state. All Response package item contents including: 1) original Correspondence; 2) assignment history; 3) review history; 4) submitted comments; 5) Response in its final form and 6) any subsequent changes shall be captured and stored as part of the archived Package data.

4.2.2.2 Response package Retrieval  The application shall provide tool and processes to support the retrieval of archived Response packages for viewing purposes. Archived Response packages are normally going to be marked as Final though they may have additional Comments and Package items that were added subsequent to the final state. All Response package data shall be restored from the archived repository. 4.2.3 Site Data Properties  The Site Data shall contain all work product related to the deployment of the application for a business entity. Multiple business entities may be active on a single deployed server so the Site Data model shall make provision for multiple business entities even though the initial deployment will encompass only one.

4.3

Correspondence Requirements 

4.3.1 Original State Preserved  Correspondence shall be saved as a Package item and shall be kept in its original state throughout the Response preparation process. 4.3.2 Variable Input Formats  The Correspondence shall be imported from multiple input data types including: 1) Portable Document Format (PDF); 2) Microsoft Word; 3) Microsoft Outlook email; and 4) text file. The application shall support the expansion of this list of input formats. 4.3.3 Compatibility with records management system  The application shall support the input of Correspondence from a record management system. Since the actual records management system has not yet been selected or deployed, this requirement can be better stated from a negative perspective. The application shall not require Correspondence to be input only from a filesystem selector tied to particular operating system. 4.3.4 Receive Correspondence  The application shall support the task of receiving Correspondence items by creating a Response package. This task is the entry point for Correspondence into the Response preparation process and shall initiate a notification message for the Process Manager group. 4.3.5 Create a Response package  The application shall create a Response package (described below) as a result of new Correspondence being received. Once a Response package is created it shall be considered active and the Process Managers shall be notified of the need to take next steps to advance the process. If the Response package is created manually by the Process Manager, no notification is required.

4.4

Response Type Requirements 

The Response Type is the process definition component for Response package. It identifies which organizational units are required to review and approve a Response as well as the timeframe in which the actions must be complete. 4.4.1 Import Existing Codes  The USDA maintains a list of codes that identify Correspondence as belonging to a type and therefore requiring a specific path for Response preparation. The application shall support the import of existing Response Type codes from the USDA's listing.

4.4.2 Create a new or edit an existing Response Type  The application shall provide a mechanism to add new Response Types to the list of those available. Existing Response Type data shall be editable within the application. 4.4.3 Response Type Properties  A Response Type record shall include at least the following information: record identifier, name, description, number of days allowed for the process, default review and approval path by organizational unit. When a Response Type is assigned to a Response package, the default attributes shall be used unless they are overridden by the Process Manager. The Response Type shall also indicate the final output format of the Response and provide a template to facilitate the ouput.

4.5

Review Path Requirements 

4.5.1 Create and Modify Review Path  The Process Manager shall have the duty of creating the initial Review Path at the time Correspondence is received and the Response package is created. The initial Review Path shall be determined by the default values established in the Response Type definitions. Reviewers shall be allowed to modify the Review Path details related to their position as described below. 4.5.2 Serial and Concurrent Review Processes  The Process Manager shall have the option of designating a serial review process (default) or a concurrent review process. The serial review process will cause the lowest level reviewer in the Review Path to be notified each time the Writer marks the Response as Ready for Review. In this model, only one Reviewer at a time shall have access to the Response for reviewing purposes in the serial review process. If the Process Manager selects the Review Path as being concurrent, all Reviewers will be notified each time the Writer marks the Response as Ready for Review and all Reviewers will have concurrent access to the draft for review and approval. 4.5.3 Review Path Properties  The Review Path shall support review / approval lists of varying length. The initial deployment of this application assumes the current SNP structure which has three organizational units supplying reviewers, this number may change if the application is deployed for other departments. 4.5.3.1 Reviewers and Timeframe Selection    The Review Path as created by the Process Manager shall detail all the organizational units needing to review and approve a Response as well as the order in which the approval shall occur and the timeframe in which the path must be completed. The highest level reviewer is selected by the Process Manager from a list of reviewers associated with the highest level organizational unit and the final delivery timeframe is chosen from the default Response Type definition. This highest level reviewer shall have the ability to select the reviewer from the next organizational unit in the Review Path and assign a delivery timeframe for the underlying process. Each subsequently selected Reviewer shall have the ability to make the next Reviewer selection and indicate the timeframe expected for the completion of this portion of the process. All timeframe values shall be a subset of the initial timeframe input by the Process Manager when the initial Review Path information was established (e.g. ­ if the Process Manager indicates the Response needs to be ready in 7 days, subsequent Reviewers can't assign delivery dates beyond the 7 day period). The Process Manager shall have the ability to mark the Response as urgent or high priority, which will drive the Response Package to be displayed at the top of a Writer or Reviewers work list and highlighted in reports on status. Each level of Reviewer shall have the ability to set a notify

deadline which will serve as the impetus for the system to send notifications to the people immediately responsible for the deliverables at the deadline. Two levels of notification (duplicate) will be sent out ­ the first directly to the party with work to complete, the second to the Reviewer who assigned the deadline. 4.5.3.2 Signatory Selection  The Process Manager shall be able to select the Signatory for a Response by first selecting the organizational unit and then the individual within that unit. While it is most common to have the Signatory roll fulfilled from a single organizational unit (e.g. ­ Executive), there will be cases where other classes of users may be enabled to act as the authority on a Response's finality. If a Signatory user is not selected by the Process Manager, the highest level Reviewer shall become the Signatory. 4.5.3.3 Writer Selection  The lowest level Reviewer (identified as the Reviewer in the last organizational unit in the Review Path list) shall select the Writer for the Response drafts. This Reviewer shall have the ability to re-assign a Writer to the Response as needed throughout the Response preparation process. 4.5.4 Review Path Exception Handling  Up to the point a Writer has been assigned to a Response package and an initial draft is started, Reviewers shall have the ability to identify the Response package as an exception case. In practical terms an exception means that a process error has occurred (i.e. ­ the Review Path included a wrong organizational unit) and remediation is required. An exception effectively reverts the Response package process up a level to the previous Reviewer. The previous Reviewer may then select a different Reviewer or agree with the exception which pushes the Response up to the previous Reviewer. In any case, exceptions can be reverted back to the Process Manager for remediation by following the single-step reverse model described here. Once a Writer has started work on a Response the exception process shall no longer be available. An authorized user, however, will have the ability to update the review path or re-assign a writer after the Writer has initiated a Response as outlined in Section 8.2.8 and 8.2.7, respectively.

4.6

Response Package Requirements 

4.6.1 Create Response Package  The Response package shall be created by the Process Manager at the time Correspondence is received using default information for Response Type and Review Path components. A Response Package shall include at least the following information: record identifier, subject, description, key words, submitter name, and program affected. 4.6.2 Response Package Properties  4.6.2.1 Correspondence  Correspondence is the initial data object that is captured at the beginning of the Response preparation process. If the Correspondence is received as an image data type, an OCR application shall be used to extract human readable content from the document and append the text to the PDF file for search and Section 508 compliance. The Correspondence shall be kept in an immutable form as a Response package item. 4.6.2.2 Response Type  The Response Type contains the information about how a piece of Correspondence should be

handled through the system. Different paths for review and approval shall be available for each Response Type. The Response Type will also indicate whether the Reviewers will review/approve the Response serially or concurrently. 4.6.2.3 Response  The Response is the intended output of the Response package. All the other components support process or background information related to the Correspondence. 4.6.2.4 Review Path  The Review Path shall identify all the organizational units required to review and approve a Response. 4.6.2.5 Status  The current status of the Response package shall be considered part of the Response package. The status is a point in time indicator of the current disposition of the Response in the context of the Review Path. The Status shall include the current Reviewer information. The Process Manager shall have the ability to enter a discontinued status for Responses that are found to be duplicate after the writing process has been initiated. 4.6.2.6 History  All data and status changes related to a Response package shall be logged. The historical log shall be considered part of the Response package. 4.6.3 Retaining Response Package Data  Once created, Response packages shall not be deleted from the system. While Response packages are considered work product and not records, they do represent the cumulative history and information associated with the Correspondence.

4.7

Search Requirements 

4.7.1 Simple Search  The application shall support simple keyword search capabilities for all information in the Response packages. The simple search shall return results sorted by relevancy and optionally by Package item type, date or User. 4.7.2 Advanced Search  The application shall support advanced search features that will allow users to search for keyword matches by Package item type, date, user, size, modified date and status. Search results shall be ordered by relevancy with provision to select ordering by presented fields. Search results shall provide brief snippets of content around the search hit and a link to the source of the match.

4.8

Report Requirements 

4.8.1 Dashboard Status  The application shall supply a simplified report format designed to give users an overall view of all Responses currently being prepared. The goal of this report is to have a single location for users to go and obtain high level information on the system and Response processes at a point in time. This report should indicate processes that are behind schedule (or in danger of falling behind) so appropriate action may be taken to escalate.

4.8.2 Responses by Status  The application shall supply tools to view Response packages by their relative status. 4.8.3 Responses by Current Reviewer  The application shall supply tools to view Response packages by their current Reviewer. In cases where the Response has not yet been marked as Ready for Review, the Writer shall be substituted for the Reviewer. 4.8.4 Audit Trail  The application shall supply a report format that will identify all of the historical activity related to a Response package including all document submissions and revisions. The audit trail report shall allow users to view process content and activity ordered by timeline and optionally by actor. 4.8.5 Output Formats  The application shall support the output of reports to the user's screen or to a PDF file for storage.

5 INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS   
Interface requirements describe interaction of the system with users, hardware, software, and communications.

5.1

User Interfaces   

The application shall support two primary user interfaces. The Admin interface will support the backup and restoration process for application data. It is expected that these features will be supplied by existing system applications (e.g. ­ MS-SQL Administration Tools) and that there will be no specific requirement for a customized user interface. The second user interface is the primary access tool for the entire application. All of the data and process control mechanisms shall be supported by the thin-client user interface supplied by the application. The graphical portion of this interface (including navigation model) shall be developed in conjunction with a team of USDA stakeholders. The developer shall provide ample time and resources to facilitate a review and acceptance process in conjunction with the USDA stakeholder team.

5.2

Hardware Interfaces   

The application shall require no hardware interfaces beyond those provided in the standard server configuration hosted in the GSS data center. The current hosting specification is included as Appendix B.

5.3

Software Interfaces   

The application shall provide notifications of Response package status changes to affected users using standard email delivery. Additionally, the application shall send Task Requests to reviewers using an API set compatible with Microsoft Outlook so review tasks can be automatically recorded in existing Outlook configurations.

5.4

Communications Interfaces   

The application shall interface with existing Active Directory resources for the purpose of user validation and role identification. The application shall access this resource as a read-only entity. The application will have access to database resources (MS-SQL) as needed. The application may use the database for data storage and retrieval and may add appropriate database related controls (i.e. ­

triggers, jobs and stored procedures).

6 DATA REQUIREMENTS   
The developer shall choose data formats and storage mechanisms appropriate to the scope and requirements of this project and as specified in the Database Development Standards (Full Reference in Appendix A). All data formats chosen by the developer shall be visible to the Administrative staff tasked with application maintenance responsibilities for backup and restoration purposes. The developer shall supply documentation to identify all the application related storage areas and preferred methods for archiving the contents.

7 OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS   
Provide the operational requirements in this section. Operational requirements describe how the system will run and communicate with operations personnel.

7.1

Security 

The application shall adhere to the relevant requirements included in the Information Systems Security Guidelines and Procedures (Full reference in Appendix A). The developer shall comply with the guidelines provided in the USDA Secure Coding Requirements (Full reference in Appendix A). 7.1.1 User Authentication  The application shall use the existing Microsoft Active Directory services provided by the USDA as the baseline user authentication authority. Beyond the initial authentication, the application shall keep track of users based on roles in the Response draft process. Some features and information will be limited to particular classes of users. 7.1.2 ClientSide Data Caching  The application shall utilize all reasonable practices to prevent client side caching of work product, user information and system information.

7.2

Audit Trail   

7.2.1 Data Preservation  The application shall preserve Response packages including all activity permanently. The application shall expose a report for the purpose of listing all activity related to a Response package including all document submissions and versioning information. 7.2.2 Modification History 
The application shall maintain a modification history log for each Response package. The activity log shall include at least the following information: 1) timestamp of the activity; 2) actor/user initiating the activity; 3) actions performed, 4) old data; 5) edited/updated data.

7.3

Data Currency   

7.3.1 Near Realtime Data Flow  The application shall save input data immediately after it is received and validated. The developer

should consider implementing a timed-save mechanism for users who may end up making large changes to an element before submitting to protect them from data loss. 7.3.2 Minimal Data Locking  The application shall not require lengthy locks on files or database records. This will facilitate fast and accurate system backups. 7.3.3 Updated Data Conflict Resolution 
The application shall keep track of and manage edit collisions. The developer shall ensure such collisions are either avoided or resolved properly to ensure data integrity.

7.4

Reliability   

The application shall ensure system reliability by utilizing a high availability software configuration. The application shall be stable on the selected OS platform and will include reasonable failover processes in the event of hardware or software failure. 7.4.1 Data Validation 
All data entered into the system shall be validated before it is recorded to the permanent repository. Ideally, the initial validation will occur on the client-side before it is posted to the server. In all cases, the server will validate incoming data before attempting to save the content in the repository.

7.4.2 Referential Integrity 
The server shall not allow data components to become orphaned in the system. If files associated with a Response package are stored on the file system, the application shall perform a periodic data integrity review to make sure all work product files reside on the file system and are accessible to the application users. In the case where files are determined to be missing, the application shall notify the System Administrator contact and the Process Manager for the affected Response package.

7.4.3 High Availability Design 
The data design shall support a high availability model.

7.5 7.6

Recoverability    System Availability   

The USDA staff will perform daily backups on the application and associated content.

The application shall be available to local and remote users as a high availability service. The application shall not require a regularly scheduled down time for system maintenance.

7.7

Fault Tolerance   

If a component fails, the application shall assume either a Down or Safe state. The actual parameters for the state change shall be determined by the developer and will ensure the integrity of existing data.

7.8

General Performance   

The response times for queries and updates shall not exceed 8 seconds for standard text submissions and retrievals. Binary data format uploads and downloads will be allowed extra time based on system bandwidth availability.

7.9

Capacity   

The application shall support thousands of Response package processes per month. The initial deployment of the application will include a very minimal number of Response processes as a test. The full application must be able to scale up to meet a much larger user base on an as needed basis.

7.10 Data Retention   
All data shall be retained permanently on the server. There are cases where the presentation of data will filter out elements identified as removed or not active.

8 USER CLASSES AND MODES OF OPERATION   
8.1 Classes/Categories of Users   

The USDA business process has a hierarchy of managing, reviewing, approving and signatory actors. The design of the Response preparation application shall preserve the organizational structure of the USDA business organizational units with regard to the requirement and order of Response package reviews and approvals.

8.1.1 System Administrators  System Administrators are the primary framework management resources. System Administrators shall have access to all the application files, configuration information and content necessary to install and maintain the service. System Administrators do not participate in the Response preparation process other than to install and maintain the services associated with the application. 8.1.2 Process Managers (SNP)  Process Managers are the initial entry point into the Response preparation system. They have connections to outside world contacts that serve as the inputs (Correspondence) for the system. The Process Managers serve as the top level decision maker with regard to the review and approval path required for a piece of Correspondence. The Process Manager shall have the ability to specify which organizational units require Review and Approval access to a Response Package. The Process Manager shall have the ability to determine which organizational unit(s) may mark a Response Package as Ready for Final or Final. 8.1.3 Writers  Writers are the resources assigned the task of formulating an appropriate Response to a piece of Correspondence. Writers have limited abilities in the Response preparation workflow. They are responsible for maintaining the Response content while it is still in draft form until it has been approved by an authorized Signatory. 8.1.4 Reviewers (Division, Branch, Section)  Reviewers function as the internal framework managers within the workflow. Reviewers for a Response are assigned by a Process Manager and may be part of a hierarchy of Reviewers representing different organizational units within the FNS (e.g. ­ Division Users, Branch Users, Section Users). Reviewers shall be maintained by organizational units. Reviewers examine the Correspondence and Response to make sure the content is appropriate and consistent with previous inquiries handled by the FNS. The application shall allow any organizational unit to be marked as able to Assign/Re-assign Writer. 8.1.5 Signatories (Executive)  Signatories normally serve as the final approval authority in the Response preparation workflow.

Response packages marked as Final by a Signatory shall be captured as a point in time snapshot of the Response and preserved in an unchangeable state for indefinite review. 8.1.6 Delegation  Reviewers shall have the ability to select a Delegate user who will act in the place of the Reviewer for an amount of time specified by the Reviewer. When this happens the Delegate shall assume all of the roles and responsibilities of the Reviewer in the system (i.e. ­ across all Response packages) except that the Delegate may not change the timeframe of the delegation period. All activities performed by the Delegate shall be recorded as having been performed by the Delegate on behalf of the Reviewer. Reviewers shall have the ability to appoint users directly above or below them as acting Delegates. Reviewers shall be able to change the timeframe of a Delegate appointment.

8.2

Functional Features 

The functional features describe the most common use case elements. These elements will be combined in a flowchart to illustrate complete use cases for specific tasks and users. 8.2.1 Load Site Data  The process by which all application information for the system is loaded into an empty hardware and software framework such that the fully functioning system is able to run without errors or lost data. 8.2.2 Archive Site Data  The full capture of application data from the hardware and software system for storage in a suitable backup repository. The information stored as a result of this task must be fully compatible with the Load Site Data function for the task to be considered successful. 8.2.3 Receive Correspondence (Create a Response Package)  The initial system trigger for tracking an incoming piece of Correspondence. The Process Manager performs this task which records the incoming information and establishes the starting point of the Response generation process. This task incorporates manual and electronic elements. Upon entry of the source tracking number for the Correspondence, the system will validate that no other Response Packages with the same tracking number exist. If a duplicate is encountered, the Process Manager should be notified and the existing Response Package should be used. 8.2.4 Create/Edit Response Types  The ability to add or modify Response Task Types in the system (e.g. ­ OES30). 8.2.5 Assign/Reassign Response Type  The process of creating or modifying a relationship between a Response package and a Task Type. The specific process and format of the Response output is determined by the Task Type. 8.2.6 Create Review Path  This is the process of identifying the expected path for a Response package to follow through the review and approval process. This task identifies the list of approvals by organizational unit which must be obtained and the order in which they are to be required. The Process Manager shall have the ability to create the initial Review Path for the Response package. The initial Review path shall indicate which organizational units must review and approve the Response and the order in which they must be processed. The Process Manager shall have the ability to select the highest level Reviewer from a list of users representing the highest level organizational unit in the Review Path. The Process Manager shall have the ability to select an individual with Signatory ability for the

Response package. If no Signatory role is explicitly selected by the Process Manager, the highest level Reviewer will be automatically assigned as the Signatory role. A note on Review deadlines: the Process Manager shall set an overall process delivery deadline for the Response package. This deadline will represent the total time available for all document creation, review, modification and approval processes. Each Reviewer that assigns a next level of reviewer will also set a delivery deadline no later than the original imposed by the Process Manager. Lower level Reviewers shall also set document creation/review/approval deadlines that fit within the time constraints imposed by their outer level deadlines. Notifications shall be sent to affected users based on the notify date/time for each task. 8.2.7 Assign/Reassign Writer  All Reviewers who are members of an organizational unit that has been marked as able to Assign/Re-assign writers shall be able to change the Writer associated with a Response package. 8.2.8 Update Review Path  The modification of an existing review path associated with a Response package. Reviewers in the current organizational unit shall have the ability to select the Reviewer in the next organizational unit in the Review Path. If the organizational unit is the last in the Review Path, the reviewer shall have the ability to mark the Response package as Ready for Final. 8.2.9 Add Package Items  Package items are supporting information points that provide clarification and direction for Reviewers and Writer. All user classes except System Administrators shall have the ability to append comments to package items individually or to the Response package as a whole. All Package items submitted for inclusion shall be scanned for viruses or malicious content using a USDA approved scanning tool. 8.2.10 Submit Comment  Actors with this ability can add comments to Response package items, or the Response package as a whole. The Comments are intended to provide more background information or raise questions about issues related to the Correspondence or the Response. 8.2.11 Create Response  Actors with this ability can create a Response as draft status as part of a Response package. The initial Response shall be generated from a template appropriate to the Response Type assigned by the Process Manager. 8.2.12 Update Response  As a Response is reviewed, changes will be required. This ability allows the Writer to modify the content of the current Response. All changes to the Response package shall be recorded and version information maintained such that all versions of the content may be restored. 8.2.13 Review Response  Reviewers shall have the ability to mark a Response version as Reviewed. During the process of marking a Response as Reviewed, Reviewers shall have the ability to include comments related to their review results. The application shall maintain the Reviewed state of all Response package items for each Reviewer. Reviewed states shall include but not be limited to: Not Reviewed, Review In Progress, Not Approved, and Approved. If the Response is marked as Not Approved, the application shall notify the Reviewer at the next lower level of the change, the lowest level Reviewer's change shall notify the Writer of a need for document revisions.

8.2.14 Create a Package Exception  In some cases a Response package must sent back up the Review Path to resolve a problem (e.g. ­ it was assigned to a wrong organizational unit). Reviewers, Writers and Signatories shall have the ability to Create a Package Exception which will conditionally alert the Reviewer prior to the current one in the Review Path. A Package Exception shall effectively rewind the Response package ownership to the previous Reviewer without rewinding the process history (i.e. ­ the exception shall be tracked as part of the process). The Process Manager shall have the ability to Create a Package Exception that rewinds the Response Package ownership back to any Reviewer in the organizational unit or themselves, if necessary. Package Exceptions shall require a description of the reason for the exception. 8.2.15 Approve Response  Reviewers shall have the ability to record their approval of a Response package by changing their Reviewed status to Approved. When a Reviewer approves a Response and it is marked as Ready for Review, the Reviewer one level higher than the current Reviewer shall be given access to the Response. All Response items and the draft Response content shall be invisible to the higher level Reviewers until they have been first approved by the lower level Reviewers. Once a Response has been approved in this manner it shall remain visible to the next level of Reviewers throughout the rest of the preparation process. 8.2.16 Mark Response as Ready for Review  After the Writer has completed a draft version or revision, the Response must begin the Review/Approval process. A Writer shall have the ability to mark a Response package as Ready for Review. When a Response is marked as Ready for Review, the application shall notify the lowest level Reviewer of the availability of new content and the Response shall become visible to the lowest level Reviewer. 8.2.17 Mark Response as Ready for Final  Writers shall have the ability to mark the Response package as Ready for Final review. This action shall cause the lowest level Reviewer to be notified with the updated status. 8.2.18 Mark Response as Final  Actors with this ability can mark a Response package as Final. A Response shall only be marked as Final when all Reviewers in the Review Path have approved the content as part of the Final Review process. A Response package marked as Final shall be captured and stored in an immutable form for future reference. An actor shall only be able to Mark Response as Final if: 1) they were selected by the Process Manager from the Signatories group or 2) no Signatory was explicitly chosen by the Process Manager and the user is the selected highest level Reviewer. 8.2.19 Archive Response  After a Response has been marked as Final the supporting Response package items shall be archived for future reference.

10.3 Appendix C -- Glossary 
Approve Response ­ A Reviewer will effectively approve a Response by marking it as Approved at the end of their review opportunity. In this sense Approve Response is one of the optional outputs of the task Review Response. Comment ­ A user submitted point of clarification related to a Response package item, or the Response package as a whole. Concurrent Approval ­ allows all Reviewers in the Review Path to review a Response when it is marked as Ready for Review. Correspondence ­ the incoming request being processed by the system which yields a Response as a final output. High Availability ­ Systems support failover mechanisms to support the full time availability of processes and data to client access. Often times this implies redundant server architectures with active

monitoring probes to detect failures and direct traffic to the backup system while alerting system administrators to the need for attention. Notify Date ­ A value used by the system to send notifications to users if their task falls behind expected delivery deadlines. Organizational Unit ­ a group of users normally at the same level in the Response preparation process tasks. Package ­ All of the documents, comments and historical actions associated with the creation of a specific Response to an incoming piece of Correspondence. Package Exception ­ A state indicating that something is wrong with the current Response Review Path or the Response itself. Package Item ­ a document that makes up part of the final response Package. Process Manager ­ Top level actor in the system. Receives Correspondence, initiates a Response package and dispatches the Response after it has been marked as Final. Ready for Final ­ A Response state indicating that all the initial reviews have been completed and the Response package is ready for the Signatory to Mark as Final. Ready for Review ­ A Response package state indicating that the Response draft form has been updated and is either in the review process or is ready to start the review process. Response ­ The document generated as a result of this process. The Response is always initiated by a piece of Correspondence. Review Response ­ The action by a Reviewer that indicates whether the Response meets the expectations of the reviewer and is suitable for a Final version. Response Review Path ­ The chain of Reviewers by organizational unit which must Approve the Response before it can become Final. Response Type ­ The internal code that identifies a piece of Correspondence as needing a particular type of approval path and final format for delivery. Review Path ­ governs the organizational units and order for review and approval of a Response. Also indicates whether the Response requires a Serial or Concurrent review process. Reviewer ­ Mid level actor with responsibilities to examine draft Response content, comment on appropriate changes and approve the content when it is deemed acceptable. Serial Approval ­ allows for Response review/approval by a single Reviewer at a time. During the review process, only one Reviewer has access to the Response for the purpose of review. Site Data ­ All of the data that makes up the content of the application. Writer ­ Low level actor responsible for creating draft Response content, making revisions to the content and marking it as Ready for Review and Ready for Final when appropriate.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

Project Management Plan Project Name: FNS Correspondence Management System Date: 9-12-2008 Project Manager: TBD Approver: TBD Approver name and title Introduction This document contains the plan for implementing the FNS Seeds of Change Correspondence Management System project. The project plan outlines the management structure for all work activities and control efforts associated with the project. The plan explains the project's team structure, scope and objectives. The information contained in this plan will be updated as additional details are defined during subsequent planning activities. In addition, after the project is underway the plan will be updated in response to actual vs. planned activities, risk mitigation approaches, change control items, quality control/testing results. A project baseline will be set upon completion of the planning phase. All of the deviations from the baseline will be managed according to the processes defined in this summary project plan or the more detailed subsidiary plans (i.e. scope management, schedule management, risk management). The subsidiary plans are maintained in separate documents that are also updated throughout the life of the project. A summary description of each subsidiary plan is provided within this project management plan. General Project Information Team Membership The team will be led by Tim McCrosson, from the IT PMO, who will fulfill the role of Project Manager for the Implementation of the Seeds of Change Correspondence Management System. Mary Jane Whitney, from the Office of the Associate Administrator for Special Nutrition Programs (SNP), will act as the Business Sponsor for the project. The specific members of the extended team will be assembled as the project is resourced, but the following skill areas will be engaged: Business Analyst, User Interface Designer, Systems Analyst, IT SME (multiple), IT Security SME, Records SME, Sr. Developer, Jr. Developer (QA Role), UAT Participants (multiple), Trainer. The Team structure and specific roles are outlined in the Organizational Breakdown Structure, which is discussed elsewhere in this document. Points of Contact

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

A contact list of team members and other stakeholders is maintained at [To Be Updated]. The list contains names, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses and project roles. The file is updated as contacts are added or removed from the project. Executive Summary Business Need/Problem: The manual nature of the current workflow introduces unnecessary activities and control risks into the correspondence response process within FNS. A review of the baseline workflow identified four critical risks that must be addressed to improve the efficiency and control of the correspondence response process. The four critical risks are: simultaneous editing of one document; response speed not matching expectations; access to past content is difficult; and inability to easily balance workload. Project Objectives: The goal of the Seeds of Change project is to increase the operational efficiency and effectiveness of correspondence management by automating the process by which incoming communications are received, reviewed and answered. The investment in this automated system supports the FNS mission by decreasing the cost associated with one of the administrative functions that must be performed to conduct business. The CMS will facilitate handling of the external correspondence flowing in and out of the Food Distribution, Child Nutrition and Supplemental Food Program Divisions. The current business process will be automated to deliver on opportunities to increase effectiveness and mitigate risks. Project Requirements and Scope Statement The new Correspondence Management System (CMS) for SNP will manage the work flow associated with receiving, assigning, writing, reviewing, approving and responding to an external correspondence. The CMS will have users classified as writers, process managers, reviewers, and signatories (those with final signoff). The users will interact with the system locally or through a remote access mechanism while out of the office. The initial implementation of the system will support approximately 150 users with the likelihood of approximately 20 to 30 concurrent users. In a typical month, SNP will handle about 30 correspondence items with a response timeline of anywhere from hours to two weeks. Each correspondence package will contain several associated draft responses as well as supporting text, spreadsheet, graphic documents. The CMS will have an intuitive and simple to use interface for writers and reviewers. It will provide quick access to the work assignment list for each user to encourage action through response preparation or review.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

The system will be highly available and maintainable. It will be modular in design by separating application, template and content data to improve maintainability. It will employ a high availability software configuration and will not require regularly scheduled down time for system maintenance. The system will have response processes for both hardware and software failures. It will also maintain a modification history for each response package that includes a date and time stamp and user for key actions performed. The system will also maintain a view into the old data in the package as well as the updated data. Because of the data entry method required in a CMS, the system will include a time-based save mechanism that will periodically store the response content before it is submitted to the database. The system will be scalable to support an expanding user group (e.g., Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Office of Research and Analysis, Financial Management) and a changing systems environment. It will be designed to support thousands of response packages per month. The initial volume will be much lower, but will grow as the system is made available to new user groups. In addition, the system will be flexible and open to allow for integration with new systems (e.g., records management system) yet to be deployed in the FNS architecture. The CMS will use the existing FNS Microsoft Active Directory services to support user authentication. The system will grant or block access to specific functions and data based on user class and organizational hierarchy. It will also limit the temporary storage of draft work product or user information on the end user desktop to minimize data exposure.

Organizational Breakdown Structure The Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) is the primary tool for developing the communications management plan and aids in the development of the project schedule. Attachment 1 (USDA Seeds of Change Org Breakdown to WBS Matrix ­ 12/05/2008) maps the nature of each role described below to the individual work packages contained in the WBS. For each intersection between OBS and WBS, a "RACI" code is assigned to describe the nature of the responsibility. "RACI" indicates who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and Informed for each line item. The roles outlined in the WBS can be combined or sub-divided as required by the Project Manager. The IT SME and UAT Participant Roles will be fulfilled by multiple individuals. In the current version of the Project Plan, the remaining roles, however, are assumed to be fulfilled by single staff persons. The following roles have been built into the Project Schedule and OBS: ˇ Project Manager ­ Accountable for overall delivery of project goals ˇ Business Sponsor ­ Business organization sign-off authority ˇ Business Analyst ­ Represents the user and business point of view ˇ Systems Analyst ­ Architect, Overall Lead Designer ˇ User Interface Designer ­ Human Factors, Style Guide Focus ˇ Sr. Developer ­ Seasoned development engineer ˇ Jr. Developer ­ Mid-level developer with QA focus ˇ IT SME (multiple) ­ Representatives from Application, Network and Infrastructure Branches ˇ IT Security SME ­ Representative from IT Security Office ˇ Records SME ­ Representative from Records Management Branch ˇ UAT Participants (multiple) ­ SNP users that are familiar with current process and requirements for future improvements ˇ Trainer ­ Focus on preparing end users to work with new system Project Schedule The Project Schedule was developed based on an iterative build approach for delivering the software solution. The schedule outlines four iterations that are released to users in one production release. In addition, the schedule contains two minor "risk reserve" releases to support post production bug fixes. The iterations are assumed to be cumulative and build in the following scope sequence:

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

ˇ Iteration #1 ­ "Happy Path" Workflow, User Roles and Functions ˇ Iteration #2 ­ "Happy Path" Reports and Dashboards ˇ Iteration #3 ­ External Interfaces and Security ˇ Iteration #4 ­ "Exception Path" Workflow, Reports and Dashboards The project tasks and hours defined in Attachment 2 (MS Project Schedule ­ USDA Seeds of Change Implementation Project Plan 12/05/2008) assume that the selection of a SharePoint solution to implement the correspondence management requirements. In addition, the Project Plan assumes an optimistic view of resource availability. In other words, all resources were assumed to be 100% available for the implementation of this specific project. The schedule was built with an April 2009 start date with the total duration not to exceed 365 days. Working time for the schedule was set based on the current Federal Holidays outlined by the Office of Personnel Management. The Project Schedule provides a graphical representation of predicted tasks, milestones, dependencies, resource requirements, task duration, and deadlines. The Project Schedule outlines each WBS task to be performed, the name of the person responsible for completing the task, the start and end date of each task, and the expected duration of the task. Cost Estimate The cost estimate currently provided in this plan is an initial estimate based on the first version of the WBS and OBS. The Project Team expects that it will require several iterations to arrive at a final estimate. Changes in the cost estimates may have impact on the scope, schedule or resource planning of the project. Likewise, any changes in scope, schedule, quality or resource planning may impact the cost estimate. The following assumptions were used to arrive at an initial cost estimate: ˇ Project Manager labor rate at $150 per hour for standard and overtime ˇ Business Sponsor labor rate at $150 per hour for standard and overtime ˇ UAT Participant labor rate at $75 per hour for standard and overtime ˇ All remaining labor rates at $100 per hour for standard and overtime ˇ Enterprise licensing for SharePoint is covered by the overall FNS SharePoint Implementation Project ˇ Overall FNS SharePoint Implementation or General Support System resources will be used to support any incremental hardware needs ˇ SNP Users will need an additional 15 Citrix licenses at a cost of $150 each. Approximately 10 users already have a Citrix account. Not all SNP users will need a Ctirix account.

Project Management Plan Subsidiary Documents The subsidiary documents outlined in this section of the Project Management Plan have been included as work packages in the initial version of the Project Schedule. They are scheduled to be completed as part of the Project Planning phase prior to holding the Project Kick-off Meeting. Separate templates are provided to aid development of the subsidiary documents:  Staffing Management Plan The Staffing Management Plan defines the project organization, resource planning (people) and process for managing project staffing. It describes when and how human resources will be brought onto and taken off of the project. The Staffing Management Plan provides for orderly and efficient management of human resources within the context of the overall Project Management Plan.  Risk Management Plan The Risk Management Plan describes how risks are identified, tracked, assessed and responded to. The plan identifies the tools used to capture identified risks, risk categories, assigned owners, calculated probabilities, identified thresholds or triggers for instigating mitigating action and contingency plans.  Procurement Management Plan The Procurement Management Plan discusses the scope of procurements that will exist for the EVM project, which include consultants, additional software and licenses, and employee training. It describes the types of contracts appropriate for the procurement, the solicitation and evaluation processes, and team/stakeholder responsibilities relative to the development of procurement documents. It discusses the timing of procurements, describing the dependencies between solicitation preparation, contract award and lead times with other aspects of the project, such as design development or deployment. The procurement plan describes the steps required by the USDA IT acquisition approval process to initiate procurement.  Quality Management Plan The Quality Management Plan describes the processes the project will use to accomplish project quality assurance and quality control. The scope of Quality Management for the EVM project includes project reporting, training, contract language and EVM deliverables. It contains the criteria used to

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

determine acceptable products and the processes used to control quality during the development, deployment and operational phase of the project.  Communications Management Plan The Communications Management Plan describes how project information is distributed, reviewed, updated and filed. The plan describes the information product, how it is produced, who produces it, when it is produced and to whom it is distributed. The plan also describes the communications forums (meetings) used to disseminate information and to escalate issues. Meeting time, purpose, attendees, sample agenda and information product(s) are all captured.  Change Control Plan The Change Control Plan describes the processes, tools and responsibilities for controlling the necessary changes to project scope, cost and schedule. The plan discusses change identification, submission, authorization and implementation. The plan identifies the tools used to track, document and communicate project changes.  Cost Management Plan The Cost Management Plan describes the process for implementing change control over cost estimates and the project time-phased cost baseline. This covers budget preparation and maintenance. It details the process for authorizing and expending project funds. The plan includes the steps taken when the performance measurement system identifies major or minor cost vs. budget variances. The plan also covers the timing and distribution of cost and performance reports.  Schedule Management Plan The Schedule Management Plan describes who owns and manages the project schedule, processes that control schedule change, reporting, updating and analysis and the process for establishing a baseline schedule.  Scope Management Plan The Scope Management Plan discusses the development, baseline and control of the WBS, the primary scope management tool. The Scope Management Plan also describes how scope changes will be managed and integrated into other project areas, such as cost and schedule.

Introduction

The Office of the Associate Administrator Special Nutrition Programs (SNP) within the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) receives a large volume of inquiries and communications from external sources that require a consistent, timely and well formulated response. The communication may arrive from an individual citizen, a public official or an advocacy group. Regardless, the response must be well researched, documented and reviewed by the appropriate experts and executives before a response is delivered. Depending on the context, the timeline for a response can range from hours to weeks. This purpose of this document is to describe the current SNP correspondence response process and to communicate the business needs related to the planned automated system for Correspondence Management. Specifically, this document will outline the current business practices, the changes needed and the desired future state for the Correspondence Management process and system. The information shared will provide the foundation for a formal Systems Requirements Specification.

2.0

Scope
2.1 Scope Statement
The focus of this system will be the manual correspondence process being managed by SNP. More specifically, it will handle the external correspondence flowing in and out of the Food Distribution, Child Nutrition and Supplemental Food Program Divisions. The current business process will be automated to deliver on opportunities to increase effectiveness and mitigate risks. The new system will not manage information requests submitted under the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, it will not govern how correspondence is tracked and managed beyond the Office of the Administrator for FNS or out in the Regional offices.

2.2

Sponsorship and Project Roles
The Business Sponsor for this project is Mary Jane Whitney, Assistant to the Associate Administrator for Special Nutrition Programs. She is acting as an advocate for the larger user community, which is comprised of Section Writers, Section Chiefs, Branch Chiefs, Division Directors, Division Secretaries and SNP Secretaries. In addition, she is representing the Office of the Associate Administrator for Special Nutrition Programs who own the final release of the correspondence response to the larger FNS organization and the general public. The Office of Information Technology within FNS will supervise development of the future system and will own operations and maintenance of the implemented system. Tim McCrosson is the IT Project Manager for the full lifecycle of the project. The majority of users will reside in the Alexandria, VA facility, but the system will also allow for remote access from home or travel site locations.

Current System or Situation
3.1 Operational Policies and Constraints
Given the manual nature of the current process, the operational policies dictate the approach for formatting and records management. The FNS/SNP Correspondence Guidelines and Procedures document outlines the response timeline, response format, and

signatory level for the response based on the Office of the Executive Secretariat processing code that is attached to the original correspondence. The current Records Management approach is "Print and File" meaning that the original correspondence and the final signed response are maintained in hard paper copy in a hanging folder system within SNP. The review drafts and interim research documents are considered working papers as specified under current FNS Records Policy.

3.2

Purpose
The goal of the Seeds of Change project is to increase the operational efficiency and effectiveness of correspondence management by automating the process by which incoming communications are received, reviewed and answered. The investment in this automated system supports FNS' mission by decreasing the cost associated with one of the administrative functions that must be performed to conduct business. In the current non-automated process, there are four critical deficiencies that must be addressed. First, there are situations in which two people may be electronically editing a document at the same time which results in a loss of work from one of those editors. Second, the speed and efficiency in which the review process moves is not always in alignment with the needs of the correspondence. A key need with regard to efficiency is to bring greater visibility into the status of a response at any given time in the process. Third, with the introduction of new people into the SNP culture, it is important to create mechanisms that allow the agency to retain and have quick access to past content that is similar to or related to current correspondence needs. Finally, SNP needs some way of reassigning and balancing work load when someone is out of the office or unable to meet the requirements of the review process. The development of an automated system to support the correspondence process will also provide the ability for remote access editing and tracking, should someone on travel need to work off-site.

3.3

Description of Current Situation
The current process for managing correspondence is extremely manual. Word processing software is the only productivity tool currently being used by the FNS team. In addition, the correspondence tracking process consists of a log used to indicate when a response comes in and out of SNP. The challenge for FNS is that there are many possible paths for a specific correspondence to travel and the expertise for responding quickly to inquiries is limited to more experienced staff members. The manual nature of the current correspondence system introduces several risks that have become increasingly difficult to manage because of the volume and speed of the correspondence flow. The critical risks are: simultaneous editing of one document; response speed not matching expectations; access to past content is difficult; and inability to easily balance workload. Many types of documents go through SNP for review, e.g., reports to Congress, internal correspondence, and messages intended for external audiences. Each document subject to SNP consideration is subject to a process of review and clearance to ensure that the message to be delivered is factually accurate and in alignment with the policies of the agency. The time that it takes for a person to read and consider the content is accepted as a given for this project, however, it is likely that maintaining a correspondence history will speed up research and analysis activities. In addition, the work behind generating copies, identifying the order of review, tracking changes and locating and identifying the status of any single document are all processes that will be positively impacted by introducing automation.

In a typical month, SNP will handle about 30 correspondence items with a response timeline of anywhere from hours to two weeks. Each correspondence package will contain several associated draft responses as well as supporting text, spreadsheet, graphic documents. Attachment A contains an activity diagram that describes the input, output and flow of the manual correspondence process. In addition, it provides use cases to describe how current users complete the steps in the overall process.

3.4

Users or Involved Personnel
The current process involves users ranging from the writers that prepare each response to the reviewers that comment and sign-off on both draft and final versions of the response. The SNP secretaries receive the original correspondence and manage the response process to completion. The Division Directors, Branch Chiefs and Section Chiefs all play a role in assigning a response owner and reviewing the draft and final responses. In some cases, the final response will be signed out by the Division Directors, but in other cases the final response will need to be reviewed and signed by the Associate Administrator. The responsibilities, activities and interactions of the users can be found in detail in Attachment A, which contains a detailed use case for the current process. At the present time, SNP does not have a formal training program for the correspondence response process. New employees that will participate in the process learn on the job. They typically rely on the more experienced members within their Section, Branch or Division to provide them with the rules and guidelines. The SNP secretaries and Division secretaries are generally sought out for their expertise on formatting and signatory requirements.

4.0

Justification for and Nature of Changes
4.1 Justification for Change
The manual nature of the current workflow introduces unnecessary activities and control risks into the correspondence response process within FNS. A review of the baseline workflow identified four critical risks that must be addressed to improve the efficiency and control of the correspondence response process. The four critical risks are: simultaneous editing of one document; response speed not matching expectations; access to past content is difficult; and inability to easily balance workload. The first critical risk is the potential for the simultaneous editing of the response document. The risk is introduced after the first draft of the response is prepared and sent for review. Typically, after a draft is prepared, the writer sends the response to the appropriate Section Chief for review and comment. The path of the review process is determined by the completeness of the draft response. If the draft requires edits and additional content, then it is returned to the writer for action. If the draft is on target, however, then the document is sent up the review chain to the Branch and Division levels. At this point in the process, the reviewers can choose to return the response to the writer for edits, enter edits into the response draft using track changes or make changes in the document directly. The risk of duplication is introduced if the reviewers make changes that don't get communicated to the writer. At that point, control of a master document is lost. In addition, when response deadlines are short, the review process is expedited with simultaneous clearance steps, which introduces the potential for loss of a

Version 1.0

Concept of Operations Document

AG-3198-P-08-0025

master correspondence document or introduction of multiple document updates. If multiple updates occur, then time is lost and the change history is disrupted. The second risk related to automating the correspondence process is the slow pace of response. In most cases, a correspondence request will arrive at SNP with several days or more having expired from the response deadline. The current process still requires that the response be manually assigned, reviewed and finalized. In addition, if anyone in the SNP front office needs to provide frequent updates to higher levels, then the status must be received manually. Both of these practices add unnecessary time to the standard and expedited response timeline. The third risk is related to access to past responses and correspondence requests. Currently, the initial correspondence and final response is logged in a paper-based hanging file. These files can be searched manually, but unless someone within SNP remembers a reference subject or timeframe it is unlikely that historical documents can be found within the response deadline of the current correspondence. As a result, SNP is forced to rely on the memory of experienced employees to make connections between current requests and past responses. Inconsistent responses would undermine policy determinations and could lead to substantial re-work within FNS. As the Federal workforce continues to retire at an accelerated rate and as employees continue to transfer to other agencies, the SNP correspondence knowledge base will further deteriorate which only increases the likelihood of this third risk being realized. The fourth risk for the current approach is the challenge in balancing workload across writers as well as Divisions, Branches and Sections. Because the current process is manual, there is no up to date visibility on response status or to view who has what workload assigned. As a result, the SNP staff has the potential to over-burden a particular Division or Branch without knowing. The staff does keep track manually as much as possible, but quickly reaches a limit during busy periods where legislative, budget and correspondence volume is elevated simultaneously.

4.2

Description of Needed Changes
The system shall automate and speed up the review process and allow for balancing workload across writers and divisions. More specifically, the system shall: 1. Eliminate the need to manually log and store a correspondence request or response draft. 2. Provide comments electronically to improve tracking, overlapping comment resolution and transmission of changes. 3. Consider concurrent reviews versus a single path review process. 4. Assign writer based on one interaction between SNP and Division, then route in system. Allow for reassignment of a response if the writer is out of the office or has too many assignments. 5. Provide the flexibility for the reviewer to assign the next reviewer or return the correspondence back to the writer with comments. 6. Provide a way for an authorized user to mark a response package as high priority or expedite. The elevated status must be conspicuous to the writer to spur immediate response action.

Version 1.0

The system shall improve process controls. The intent of this core requirement is to reduce the potential for errors and minimize the likelihood of missing response deadlines. More specifically, the system shall: 1. Notify correspondence source of receipt and timeline for response. 2. Clearly define who must take action on a correspondence request and under what timeline. 3. Clearly define who has ownership to edit a correspondence response at any given time. 4. Provide immediate visibility into who has ownership (writer, reviewer, secretary) of a specific response at any given time and where it is in the review process (to be assigned, assigned to writer, draft review, final review). 5. Establish automatic reminder or alerts to writers and reviewers when deadlines are approaching or responses have not be handled. 6. Provide a mechanism for searching past responses by topic to increase consistency in response content and style. 7. Establish pre-defined response templates that can be automatically applied based on the type of correspondence requested. 8. Upon entry of an external tracking number (e.g., OES tracking) validate that another response package doesn't include the same tracking number. The goal is to prevent the creation of two packages meant to address the same correspondence request. 9. If a duplicate response is discovered after a draft has been initiated, an authorized user needs to be able to close the response and append information to the surviving response package. The system shall eliminate the need to print documents unless required by the current FNS Records Management Standards. More specifically, the system will: 1. Eliminate the need to print correspondence that arrives at SNP in electronic format. 2. Minimize the need to print a correspondence response draft for review and storage.

4.3

Priorities Among the Changes
The top priority for SNP is to improve the controls surrounding the correspondence response process. The desire is to clearly establish who has ownership for a response at any given time. In addition, the SNP team needs to be able to find out the status of the response without having to call around the Division for an update. This core requirement is essential. The second priority for the correspondence process improvement is to speed up the review process to minimize the possibility for missing deadlines. SNP is often faced with quick turnaround times because of delays in receiving the initial correspondence or requests to expedite. This core requirement is essential. The remaining priorities for SNP are the ability to balance or reassign response workload and to reduce paper waste where possible. These two additional requirement groupings are desirable.

4.4

Assumptions, Dependencies, Constraints
The implementation of a Correspondence Management System (CMS) will not change the SNP records management approach. The approach will continue to follow the "File and Print" standard that has been adopted by FNS. The project team will assume that this approach will be maintained until an automated records management system is implemented and certified by FNS. The project team assumes that response formatting requirements are driven by Correspondence Type. The requirements may be updated periodically, but the SNP secretaries will update the new CMS with changes as they are received. The project team is assuming that the research and writing process is happening as fast as possible. The productivity gains related to automation will come from the reduced review timeline and the reminders/alerts for responses that are approaching deadline.

5.0

Concept for a New or Modified System
5.1 Background, Objectives, and Scope
The goal of the Seeds of Change project is to increase the operational efficiency and effectiveness of correspondence management by automating the process by which incoming communications are received, reviewed and answered. The investment in this automated system supports the FNS mission by decreasing the cost associated with one of the administrative functions that must be performed to conduct business. The CMS will facilitate handling of the external correspondence flowing in and out of the Food Distribution, Child Nutrition and Supplemental Food Program Divisions. The current business process will be automated to deliver on opportunities to increase effectiveness and mitigate risks. The new system will not manage requests submitted under the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, it will not govern how correspondence is tracked and managed beyond the Office of the Administrator for FNS or in the Regional offices.

5.2

Operational Policies and Constraints
The implementation of a CMS to automate and improve the current process will not drive any changes to existing SNP business policies. With the initial implementation of the system, SNP will operate under a "print and file" records management system, which is the current FNS standard. Under this standard, the initial correspondence received and the final, signed response will be printed and filed in a file cabinet. The interim drafts and supporting documentation will be managed as "work product" as specified under the "print and file" standard. The requirements specified in the subsequent sections of this document, however, will request that the developed system will provide the flexibility to interface with an electronic records management system in the future.

5.3

Description of New or Modified System
The new CMS for SNP will manage the work flow associated with receiving, assigning, writing, reviewing, approving and responding to an external correspondence. The CMS will have users classified as writers, process managers, reviewers, and signatories (those with final sign-off). The users will interact with the system locally or through a remote access mechanism while out of the office. The initial implementation of the system will

Version 1.0

10/25/2008

Concept of Operations Document

AG-3198-P-08-0025

support approximately 150 users with the likelihood of approximately 20 to 30 concurrent users. In a typical month, SNP will handle about 30 correspondence items with a response timeline of anywhere from hours to two weeks. Each correspondence package will contain several associated draft responses as well as supporting text, spreadsheet, graphic documents. The CMS will have an intuitive and simple to use interface for writers and reviewers. It will provide quick access to the work assignment list for each user to encourage action through response preparation or review. The system will be highly available and maintainable. It will be modular in design by separating application, template and content data to improve maintainability. It will employ a high availability software configuration and will not require regularly scheduled down time for system maintenance. The system will have response processes for both hardware and software failures. It will also maintain a modification history for each response package that includes a date and time stamp and user for key actions performed. The system will also maintain a view into the old data in the package as well as the updated data. Because of the data entry method required in a CMS, the system will include a time-based save mechanism that will periodically store the response content before it is submitted to the database. The system will be scalable to support an expanding user group (e.g., Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Office of Research and Analysis, Financial Management) and a changing systems environment. It will be designed to support thousands of response packages per month. The initial volume will be much lower, but will grow as the system is made available to new user groups. In addition, the system will be flexible and open to allow for integration with new systems (e.g., records management system) yet to be deployed in the FNS architecture. The CMS will leverage any existing authentication or user permissions services to support access control and security. The system will grant or block access to specific functions and data based on user class and organizational hierarchy. It will also limit the temporary storage of draft work product or user information on the end user desktop to minimize data exposure.

5.4

Users or Affected Personnel
This shall describe the types of users of the new or modified system, including, as applicable, organizational structures, training/skills, responsibilities, and interactions with one another. The correspondence response process is managed by SNP Secretaries, the Assistant to the Associate Administrator, Writers, Reviewers and Signatories. The response process is triggered when the SNP secretaries receive a correspondence that requires a response. The system users will perform responsibilities similar to today, but they will be automated through a correspondence management system. The automation support will change the way that users interact. They will use the workflow capabilities of the new system to prepare drafts via template, exchange documents for review and submit final documents for signature. The following sections describe how the primary users will interact with the system. SNP Secretaries are the initial entry point into the response preparation system. They have connections to outside world contacts that serve as the inputs (correspondence) for

Version 1.0

7

10/25/2008

Concept of Operations Document

AG-3198-P-08-0025

the system. They serve as the top level decision maker with regard to the review and approval path required for a correspondence. The SNP Secretaries shall have the ability to specify which organizational units require review and approval access to a response package. They will have the ability to determine which organizational unit(s) may mark a response package as ready for final or final. Writers are the resources assigned the task of formulating an appropriate response to a correspondence. Writers have limited abilities in the response preparation workflow. They are responsible for maintaining the response content while it is still in draft form until it has been approved by an authorized Signatory. Reviewers function as the internal framework managers within the workflow. Reviewers for a response are assigned by the SNP secretaries and may be part of a hierarchy of Reviewers representing different organizational units within the FNS (e.g. ­ Division Users, Branch Users, Section Users). Reviewers shall be maintained by organizational units. Reviewers examine the correspondence and response to make sure the content is appropriate and consistent with previous inquiries handled by the FNS. Signatories normally serve as the final approval authority in the response preparation workflow.

5.5

Support Strategy
The CMS will be classified as an FNS General Support System (GSS), which will drive the processes associated with daily backups, and power and network connectivity for the hosted application. The USDA staff will define and maintain policies for network security and access. In addition, the CMS will inherit the existing user base maintenance and remote access policies that are in place within FNS. The current remote access mechanism will need to support the increased demand associated with the implementation of the CMS.

6.0

Operational Scenarios
The new system will automate the current manual process for correspondence response preparation and review. The process is initiated when the SNP front office receives a correspondence from an external party. The SNP secretary that receives the correspondence assigns a responsible division, which begins the process to assign a writer, prepare a response and complete a thorough review. The basic sequence of activities would flow like the following: 1. The SNP Secretary receives Correspondence and notifies the source of receipt. 2. Based on the Correspondence origin and type, the SNP Secretary creates a Response package with a Response Type and Review Path. 3. The SNP Secretary assigns the highest level Reviewer. 4. The SNP Secretary assigns the Signatory. 5. Reviewers along the Review Path assign the next Reviewer in the chain. 6. The final reviewer assigns the Writer. 7. The Writer creates a Response 8. The Writer marks the Response as Ready for Review. 9. Reviewers examine the Response, comment and request changes. The review process works upward through the reviewer chain until it reaches the highest level Reviewer in the chain. The Writer may be asked to initiate revisions which will rewind the Review process back to the lowest in the chain. 10. After all Reviewers have approved the Response revisions, the Writer marks the

Version 1.0

Concept of Operations Document

AG-3198-P-08-0025

Response as Ready for Final. 11. The review process works backward through the chain until it reaches the Signatory who either marks it as final or returns back down the review chain for changes. 12. The SNP Secretary delivers the Response in its final state to the entity generating the Correspondence. A receipt from the external entity is manually logged. A detailed activity diagram and set of use cases for the future system are available for review in Appendix B.

7.0

Summary of Impacts
7.1 Operational Impacts
Because the CMS is a completely new system, the project team will not see any operational impacts from changes to operating centers, data sources, interfaces, emergency conditions, or systems procedures. The operational impacts, however, will be seen in launching the new CMS into the OIT production environment and the SNP business environment. The approach for launching into the OIT production environment has been outlined in Sections 5.3 to 5.5 of this document. The impacts for releasing the CMS into the SNP business environment are outlined in Section 7.2 and 7.3 below.

7.2

Organizational Impacts
The new correspondence system will not introduce organizational changes (position changes, new roles) within SNP. The launch of the new system will require moderate training, which is described in the next section.

7.3

Impacts During Development
Because there is no current system, the SNP user community will not have to worry about process interruption as the new system is developed or deployed. The system will be constructed in an FNS Office of Information Technology development environment. The SNP user community will need to be involved in the Detailed Design phase of the project to confirm that the approach for automation proposed by the developer meets the needs described in this document. In addition, a representative group from SNP will need to be involved in User Acceptance Testing for the new system. The user group will be comprised of multiple user types including process experts, "super-users," and typical Branch and Section users. User Acceptance Testing will not use production data, but will follow the production process outlined for the new automated approach for handling correspondence. Upon completion of User Acceptance Testing, the production system will be migrated to users in phases. Initially, the project team will launch the system to one Division, Branch and Section to confirm full production readiness. Upon completion of production testing, the system will be launched to the remainder of the SNP community. With the introduction of the use of automated templates and a more sophisticated review process, the project team will work with the SNP business sponsor to develop a training program. The intent of the training program will be to familiarize the SNP users with the work flow and procedures associated with the new system. In addition, the project team will walk the user community through the functions, queries, and reports of the new correspondence system.

Analysis of the Proposed System ­ Alternatives Considered
The purpose of the alternatives analysis is to identify and evaluate several leading technologies that could be applied as a solution that meets Correspondence Management goals. The analysis is not going to encompass all potential candidates but will address several of the top options. In addition, the scores assigned to each candidate are not intended to establish a prejudice before any actual proposals are prepared. The scores should show the intrinsic strengths or weaknesses associated with each approach ­ special attention should be given to proposals utilizing these technologies to make sure the weaknesses are properly managed in an accepted project.

8.1

Primary Criteria Measured
Quick Learning Curve (30%) ­ This criterion indicates the level of effort required by all users and maintainers of the system to attain full operational benefit. Solutions that are easy to learn and maintain will rank higher on this measure. Functional Requirements (30%) ­ Fulfillment of the Correspondence Management requirements will account for a significant portion of the evaluated score for each alternative. The more fully a solution meets the functional requirements, the higher value it will receive. Lifecycle Costs (%15) ­ The total cost to implement and operate the solution will account for about 15% of the total solution score. A lower total cost will result in a higher score. FNS Skill-Set Requirements (10%) ­ This measure accounts for the level of effort required by the IT professionals tasked with deploying and maintaining the chosen solution. Alternatives requiring the least amount of FNS educational effort will rank the highest with this criterion. Leverage Existing Efforts (10%) ­ The degree to which the solution uses technology already deployed by FNS or is readily accessible to users will impact the solution score by this factor. Solutions spanning more current technologies will rank higher in this area. Technical Requirements (5%) ­ Solutions that meet all of the technical requirements as specified in the Concept of Operations will gain the highest value from this criterion. Scoring these criteria will work on a 100 point basis and will reflect an educated and somewhat objective estimated opinion on the ability of the alternative to adequately meet this criterion.

8.2

Alternatives Summary
While there are several options available it is likely the final solution will revolve around either the SharePoint or ECM tools. Since the ECM tool provides limited flexibility for matching current business process tasks it will not be top selection. Based on the preliminary data available, solutions based on a Sharepoint implementation will be heavy favorites.

Quick Learning Curve (Custom) ­ Custom applications can be tailored to very closely match business processes in ways boxed solutions can't. Solutions matching current business processes will be easiest to learn. Functional Requirements (SharePoint) ­ A SharePoint based solution will likely be most flexible in terms of designing an application to fit the specific needs of FNS while maintaining a high level of portability. The components built within SharePoint can be tailored to the specific needs of FNS. Lifecycle Costs (QTrak) ­ It is hard for custom software to compete with boxed solutions on price. Ironically the converse is also true when it comes to flexibility and features. Leverage Existing (Multiple) ­ While 3 solutions rank the same in this measurement because they would utilize existing hardware and software platforms it is likely the SharePoint implementation will leverage existing desktop application resources more efficiently (Microsoft products tend to work better with each other). Technical Requirements (SharePoint) ­ System architecture, platform, data portability, workflow controls and other main requirements will be more easily met by a SharePoint solution.

Assumptions, Constraints, Pre-requisites, Authority, Responsibilities
9.1 Schedule
The Project Schedule was developed based on an iterative build approach for delivering the software solution. The schedule outlines four iterations that are released to users in one production release. In addition, the schedule contains two minor "risk reserve" releases to support post production bug fixes. The iterations are assumed to be cumulative and build in the following scope sequence: ˇ Iteration #1 ­ "Happy Path" Workflow, User Roles and Functions ˇ ˇ ˇ Iteration #2 ­ "Happy Path" Reports and Dashboards Iteration #3 ­ External Interfaces and Security Iteration #4 ­ "Exception Path" Workflow, Reports and Dashboards

The project tasks and hours defined in the USDA Seeds of Change Implementation Project Plan 12/05/2008 assume the selection of a SharePoint solution to implement the

correspondence management requirements. In addition, the Project Plan assumes an optimistic view of resource availability. In other words, all resources were assumed to be 100% available for the implementation of this specific project. The schedule was built with an April 2009 start date with the total duration not to exceed 365 days. Working time for the schedule was set based on the current Federal Holidays outlined by the Office of Personnel Management. The Project Schedule (provided in a separate document) provides a graphical representation of predicted tasks, milestones, dependencies, resource requirements, task duration, and deadlines. The Project Schedule outlines each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) task to be performed, the name of the person responsible for completing the task, the start and end date of each task, and the expected duration of the task.

Cost
The cost estimate currently provided in this plan is an initial estimate based on the first version of the WBS and OBS. The Project Team expects that it will require several iterations to arrive at a final estimate. Changes in the cost estimates may have impact on the scope, schedule or resource planning of the project. Likewise, any changes in scope, schedule, quality or resource planning may impact the cost estimate. The following assumptions were used to arrive at an initial cost estimate: ˇ Project Manager labor rate at $150 per hour for standard and overtime ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Business Sponsor labor rate at $150 per hour for standard and overtime UAT Participant labor rate at $75 per hour for standard and overtime All remaining labor rates at $100 per hour for standard and overtime Enterprise licensing for SharePoint is covered by the overall FNS SharePoint Implementation Project Overall FNS SharePoint Implementation or General Support System resources will be used to support any incremental hardware needs SNP Users will need an additional 15 Citrix licenses at a cost of $150 each. Approximately 10 users already have a Citrix account. Not all SNP users will need a Ctirix account.

As much as is possible, data structures shall be fully normalized and organized in a reasonable manner. OIT Standards or Guidelines The application data must be portable to other systems to facilitate future system upgrades and changes. Portability does not include to alternative operating system platforms. While these changes are not known at the time, the developer is expected to keep data in a format that may be accessed by known components today for Transportability of Data export/import into future systems. Concept of Operations Content is expected to be properly identified and stored in a reasonable fashion. The system will need to keep application, template and content data separated in storage Modular System Design to improve maintainability. FNS OIT Guideline It is expected that the initial application will be deployed to the current USDA staff for an undetermined period of trial. Based on the success of the trial period, the application may be deployed for a larger user base. This level of expansion will require the application to be scalable beyond a single SNP/Division/Section/Branch organizational structure. The software and the final detailed design will need to detail Scalability and provide for this potential expansion. Concept of Operations Since this is not a customer facing application it is expected that the application is the administrative interface. The developer should not need to build administration specific tools for such tasks as archival and data re-loading ­ these are expected to be done by a system administrator using existing platform tools (i.e. ­ MS-SQL Server tools).

2.2.1.4

The USDA may deploy record management systems around this application in the future. The application is a process management system that maintains status information and work product to support the production of a Response. The resulting response (as well as the incoming Correspondence) may need to be drawn from and saved to a third party record management system. To facilitate this, the system shall be capable of supporting an API set for data inputs (Correspondence, Package Items) Future Expansion (API, and outputs (Finalized Response). These will not be a part of the initial deployment. Assumption other systems) The developer shall document these APIs for the USDA. Concept of Operations The application will be deployed to users with computers configured per the current FDCC (http://nvd.nist.gov/fdcc/index.cfm) requirements. This will limit the availability of certain applications and techniques that may be widely acceptable in the public sector. The developer will need to ensure the application doesn't require components Constraint - Client FDCC Baseline or configurations in conflict with the FDCC standard. FNS OIT Guideline All use cases shall be executable without the installation of special client-side Constraint - Client Thin Client applications. FNS OIT Guideline Internet Explorer Other browsers may be used, but Internet Explorer version 7 is the expected baseline Constraint - Client version 7 browser. FNS OIT Guideline The USDA currently uses a Citrix SSL client with two-factor identification to facilitate remote user access to internal server resources. The developer will not need to build remote access tools for the client side. USDA staff is already maintaining the user Constraint - Client Remote Access base and remote access installation and policies. Concept of Operations Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended, 29 U.S.C. Section 794d, requires that when federal agencies develop, procure, maintain or use electronic and information technology (IT), they must ensure that federal employees and members of the public with disabilities, have access to and use of information and data comparable to that available to non-disabled employees and members of the public unless meeting compliance standards would pose an undue burden. The application shall comply with Section 508 accessibility requirements. FNS OIT Guideline The USDA is predominantly a Microsoft Windows based client and server environment. The application shall be built to run on these resources without major modification. FNS OIT Guideline

The USDA staff will handle daily backups, provide power and network connectivity for the hosted application. Network security and access policies will also be managed by USDA staff. The application should not rely on services outside those specifically required in this document as they may not be accessible from the application server's network context. It should be reasonably assumed that resources specified in this document will be available to the application as "high availability" services (e.g. ­ Microsoft Active Directory). The USDA currently uses Microsoft Active Directory services for user credentials. The application shall interface with the current Active Directory system to obtain user validation information. All application configuration, code and content shall be stored and developed on USDA managed servers. The developer shall only use non-production content in the development environment. The following code development and management tools will be provided for the developer (for the USDA development environment): Rational RequisitePro (requirements/code management), Rational ClearCase (configuration/release management) and Rational ClearQuest (bug tracking). The developer shall maintain all application related work product with these tools.

User level documentation (User Manual Format) shall be described in detail all possible user interactions with the application. Help Desk level documentation (Operations Manual; Installation/Configuration Template) shall provide an in depth coverage of all the issues that may be encountered by the application support team. The USDA formats for these documents are referenced in Appendix A. FNS OIT Guideline The CMS application will reside on servers hosted by the USDA as a GSS (General System Support) asset. The hardware will be on a private/switched LAN segment and may have other sibling network segments around it. Concept of Operations The application will take Correspondence documents as an initial input. These are scanned and saved as a PDF file. During the Response creation, review and approval process additional documents may be added to the Package. These may consist in a variety of formats and serve as supporting information for consideration during the Response drafting process. The final product of this process is a Response document.

Loading Data

The application shall facilitate/automate the current manual process for Response preparation. A thumbnail sketch of the logic involved in the process would follow these lines: 1. The Process Manager receives Correspondence. 2. Based on the Correspondence origin and type, the Process Manager creates a Response package with a Response Type and Review Path. 3. The Process Manager assigns the highest level Reviewer. 4. The Process Manager assigns the Signatory. 5. Reviewers along the Review Path assign the next Reviewer in the chain. 6. The final reviewer assigns the Writer. 7. The Writer creates a Response 8. The Writer marks the Response as Ready for Review. 9. Reviewers examine the Response, comment and request changes. The review process works upward through the reviewer chain until it reaches the highest level Reviewer in the chain. The Writer may be asked to initiate revisions which will rewind the Review process back to the lowest in the chain. 10. After all Reviewers have approved the Response revisions, the Writer marks the Response as Ready for Final. 11. The review process works backward through the chain until it reaches the Signatory who either marks it as final or returns back down the review chain for changes. 12. The Process Manager delivers the Response in its final state to the entity Distribution & generating the Correspondence. Assignment Logic Concept of Operations There are two ways data may be stored or accessed in the system. The first way would be as an administrative user through common operating system tools. This level of access does not directly access the detail of the data but rather the application data as a whole. The purpose for this access is primarily for data backup and restoration when needed. The second data access path would include all the editing options exposed by the application. The purpose for this path is to facilitate the FNS OIT Guideline Access to Stored Data application need for storage. The application shall be responsible for establishing the details of the data flow to Data Flow meet the requirements stated elsewhere in this document. Development Best Practice The application shall support an initial Site Data load process which will allow System Initial Import Administrators to load data from a pre-formatted file. Development Best Practice The application shall support data recovery at a Site Data level. The Site Data shall include all work product data associated with the application. Site Data recovery shall be possible from an un-initialized system to allow for a bare-metal restoration path. A recovery action shall only be deemed successful if all data has been restored and Recovery verified as correct in the running application. Development Best Practice The application shall provide tools and processes that will allow users to move specific Response packages to an archived state. All Response package item contents including: 1) original Correspondence; 2) assignment history; 3) review history; 4) submitted comments; 5) Response in its final form and 6) any subsequent changes shall be captured and stored as part of the archived Package data. Concept of Operations The application shall provide tool and processes to support the retrieval of archived Response packages for viewing purposes. Archived Response packages are normally going to be marked as Final though they may have additional Comments and Package items that were added subsequent to the final state. All Response package data shall be restored from the archived repository. Concept of Operations The Site Data shall contain all work product related to the deployment of the application for a business entity. Multiple business entities may be active on a single deployed server so the Site Data model shall make provision for multiple business entities even though the initial deployment will encompass only one. Concept of Operations Correspondence shall be saved as a Package item and shall be kept in its original state throughout the Response preparation process. Concept of Operations

Correspondence

The Correspondence shall be imported from multiple input data types including: 1) Portable Document Format (PDF); 2) Microsoft Word; 3) Microsoft Outlook email; and Variable Input Formats 4) text file. The application shall support the expansion of this list of input formats. Concept of Operations The application shall support the input of Correspondence from a record management system. Since the actual records management system has not yet been selected or Compatibility with deployed, this requirement can be better stated from a negative perspective. The Records Management application shall not require Correspondence to be input only from a filesystem System selector tied to particular operating system. Concept of Operations The application shall support the task of receiving Correspondence items by creating a Response package. This task is the entry point for Correspondence into the Receive Response preparation process and shall initiate a notification message for the Correspondence Process Manager group. Concept of Operations The application shall create a Response package (described below) as a result of new Correspondence being received. Once a Response package is created it shall be considered active and the Process Managers shall be notified of the need to take next Create a Response steps to advance the process. If the Response package is created manually by the Package Process Manager, no notification is required. Concept of Operations The USDA maintains a list of codes that identify Correspondence as belonging to a type and therefore requiring a specific path for Response preparation. The application shall support the import of existing Response Type codes from the USDA's listing. Concept of Operations The application shall provide a mechanism to add new Response Types to the list of those available. Existing Response Type data shall be editable within the application. Concept of Operations A Response Type record shall include at least the following information: record identifier, name, description, number of days allowed for the process, default review and approval path by organizational unit. When a Response Type is assigned to a Response package, the default attributes shall be used unless they are overridden by the Process Manager. The Response Type shall also indicate the final output format of the Response and provide a template to facilitate the output. Concept of Operations The Process Manager shall have the duty of creating the initial Review Path at the time Correspondence is received and the Response package is created. The initial Review Path shall be determined by the default values established in the Response Type definitions. Reviewers shall be allowed to modify the Review Path details related to their position as described below. Concept of Operations

In this model, only one Reviewer at a time shall have access to the Response for reviewing purposes in the serial review process. If the Process Manager selects the Review Path as being concurrent, all Reviewers will be Serial and Concurrent notified each time the Writer marks the Response as Ready for Review and all Review Processes Reviewers will have concurrent access to the draft for review and approval. Concept of Operations The Review Path shall support review / approval lists of varying length. The initial deployment of this application assumes the current SNP structure which has three organizational units supplying reviewers, this number may change if the application is Review Path Properties deployed for other departments.

Review Path

Reviewers and Timeframe Selection

The Review Path as created by the Process Manager shall detail all the organizational units needing to review and approve a Response as well as the order in which the approval shall occur and the timeframe in which the path must be completed. The highest level reviewer is selected by the Process Manager from a list of reviewers associated with the highest level organizational unit and the final delivery timeframe is chosen from the default Response Type definition. This highest level reviewer shall have the ability to select the reviewer from the next organizational unit in the Review Path and assign a delivery timeframe for the underlying process. Each subsequently selected Reviewer shall have the ability to make the next Reviewer selection and indicate the timeframe expected for the completion of this portion of the process. All timeframe values shall be a subset of the initial timeframe input by the Process Manager when the initial Review Path information was established (e.g. ­ if the Process Manager indicates the Response needs to be ready in 7 days, subsequent Reviewers can't assign delivery dates beyond the 7 day period). The Process Manager shall have the ability to mark the Response as urgent or high priority, which will drive the Response Package to be displayed at the top of a Writer or Reviewers work list and highlighted in reports on status. Each level of Reviewer shall have the ability to set a notify deadline which will serve as the impetus for the system to send notifications to the people immediately responsible for the deliverables at the deadline. Two levels of notification (duplicate) will be sent out ­ the first directly to the party with work to complete, the second to the Reviewer who assigned the deadline. Concept of Operations The Process Manager shall be able to select the Signatory for a Response by first selecting the organizational unit and then the individual within that unit. While it is most common to have the Signatory roll fulfilled from a single organizational unit (e.g. ­ Executive), there will be cases where other classes of users may be enabled to act as the authority on a Response's finality. If a Signatory user is not selected by the Process Manager, the highest level Reviewer shall become the Signatory. Concept of Operations The lowest level Reviewer (identified as the Reviewer in the last organizational unit in the Review Path list) shall select the Writer for the Response drafts. This Reviewer shall have the ability to re-assign a Writer to the Response as needed throughout the Response Concept of Operations p ppreparation process. g p p g

is started, Reviewers shall have the ability to identify the Response package as an exception case. In practical terms an exception means that a process error has occurred (i.e. ­ the Review Path included a wrong organizational unit) and remediation is required. An exception effectively reverts the Response package process up a level to the previous Reviewer. The previous Reviewer may then select a different Reviewer or agree with the exception which pushes the Response up to the previous Reviewer. In any case, exceptions can be reverted back to the Process Manager for remediation by following the single-step reverse model described here. Once a Writer has started work on a Response the exception process shall no longer Review Path Exception be available. An authorized user, however, will have the ability to update the review path or re-assign a writer after the Writer has initiated a Response as outlined in Concept of Operations Handling The Response package shall be created by the Process Manager at the time Correspondence is received using default information for Response Type and Review Path components. A Response Package shall include at least the following Create Response information: record identifier, subject, description, key words, submitter name, and Package program affected. Concept of Operations Correspondence is the initial data object that is captured at the beginning of the Response preparation process. If the Correspondence is received as an image data type, an OCR application shall be used to extract human readable content from the document and append the text to the PDF file for search and Section 508 compliance. The Correspondence shall be kept in an immutable form as a Response package Correspondence item. Concept of Operations

FNS Correspondence Management System Requirements Traceability Matrix
References are made to the USDA FNS Requirements v002dcm SRS Reference Number Category Title Description The Response Type contains the information about how a piece of Correspondence should be handled through the system. Different paths for review and approval shall be available for each Response Type. The Response Type will also indicate whether the Reviewers will review/approve the Response serially or concurrently. The Response is the intended output of the Response package. All the other components support process or background information related to the Correspondence. The Review Path shall identify all the organizational units required to review and approve a Response. The current status of the Response package shall be considered part of the Response package. The status is a point in time indicator of the current disposition of the Response in the context of the Review Path. The Status shall include the current Reviewer information. The Process Manager shall have the ability to enter a discontinued status for Responses that are found to be duplicate after the writing process has been initiated. All data and status changes related to a Response package shall be logged. The historical log shall be considered part of the Response package. Source of Requirement Validation Approach

Concept of Operations The application shall supply a report format that will identify all of the historical activity related to a Response package including all document submissions and revisions. The audit trail report shall allow users to view process content and activity ordered by Audit Trail timeline and optionally by actor. Concept of Operations The application shall support the output of reports to the user's screen or to a PDF file Output Formats for storage. Concept of Operations The application shall support two primary user interfaces. The Admin interface will support the backup and restoration process for application data. It is expected that these features will be supplied by existing system applications (e.g. ­ MS-SQL Administration Tools) and that there will be no specific requirement for a customized user interface. The second user interface is the primary access tool for the entire application. All of the data and process control mechanisms shall be supported by the thin-client user interface supplied by the application. The graphical portion of this interface (including navigation model) shall be developed in conjunction with a team of USDA stakeholders. The developer shall provide ample time and resources to facilitate a review and acceptance process in conjunction with the USDA stakeholder team.

The developer shall comply with the guidelines provided in the USDA Secure Coding Requirements (Full reference in Appendix A). The application shall use the existing Microsoft Active Directory services provided by the USDA as the baseline user authentication authority. Beyond the initial authentication, the application shall keep track of users based on roles in the Response draft process. Some features and information will be limited to particular classes of users. The application shall utilize all reasonable practices to prevent client side caching of work product, user information and system information. The application shall preserve Response packages including all activity permanently. The application shall expose a report for the purpose of listing all activity related to a Response package including all document submissions and versioning information. The application shall maintain a modification history log for each Response package. The activity log shall include at least the following information: 1) timestamp of the activity; 2) actor/user initiating the activity; 3) actions performed, 4) old data; 5) edited/updated data. The application shall save input data immediately after it is received and validated. The developer should consider implementing a timed-save mechanism for users who may end up making large changes to an element before submitting to protect them from data loss. The application shall not require lengthy locks on files or database records. This will facilitate fast and accurate system backups. Source of Requirement Validation Approach

System Administrators are the primary framework management resources. System Administrators shall have access to all the application files, configuration information and content necessary to install and maintain the service. System Administrators do not participate in the Response preparation process other than to install and maintain System Administrators the services associated with the application. Concept of Operations Process Managers are the initial entry point into the Response preparation system. They have connections to outside world contacts that serve as the inputs (Correspondence) for the system. The Process Managers serve as the top level decision maker with regard to the review and approval path required for a piece of Correspondence. The Process Manager shall have the ability to specify which organizational units require Review and Approval access to a Response Package. The Process Manager shall have the ability to determine which organizational unit(s) may mark a Response Package as Ready for Final or Final. Concept of Operations Writers are the resources assigned the task of formulating an appropriate Response to a piece of Correspondence. Writers have limited abilities in the Response preparation workflow. They are responsible for maintaining the Response content while it is still in draft form until it has been approved by an authorized Signatory. Concept of Operations Reviewers function as the internal framework managers within the workflow. Reviewers for a Response are assigned by a Process Manager and may be part of a hierarchy of Reviewers representing different organizational units within the FNS (e.g. ­ Division Users, Branch Users, Section Users). Reviewers shall be maintained by organizational units. Reviewers examine the Correspondence and Response to make sure the content is appropriate and consistent with previous inquiries handled by the FNS.

The specific process and format of the Response output is determined Assign/Re-assign by the Task Type. Concept of Operations Response Type This is the process of identifying the expected path for a Response package to follow through the review and approval process. This task identifies the list of approvals by organizational unit which must be obtained and the order in which they are to be required. The Process Manager shall have the ability to create the initial Review Path for the Response package. The initial Review path shall indicate which organizational units must review and approve the Response and the order in which they must be processed. The Process Manager shall have the ability to select the highest level Reviewer from a list of users representing the highest level organizational unit in the Review Path. The Process Manager shall have the ability to select an individual with Signatory ability for the Response package. If no Signatory role is explicitly selected by the Process Manager, the highest level Reviewer will be automatically assigned as the Signatory role. A note on Review deadlines: the Process Manager shall set an overall process delivery deadline for the Response package. This deadline will represent the total time available for all document creation, review, modification and approval processes. Each Reviewer that assigns a next level of reviewer will also set a delivery deadline no later than the original imposed by the Process Manager.

The application shall maintain the Reviewed state of all Response package items for each Reviewer. Reviewed states shall include but not be limited to: Not Reviewed, Review In Progress, Not Approved, and Approved. If the Response is marked as Not Approved, the application shall notify the Reviewer at the next lower level of the change, the lowest level Reviewer's change shall notify the Writer of a need for document revisions. Concept of Operations In some cases a Response package must sent back up the Review Path to resolve a problem (e.g. ­ it was assigned to a wrong organizational unit). Reviewers, Writers and Signatories shall have the ability to Create a Package Exception which will conditionally alert the Reviewer prior to the current one in the Review Path. A Package Exception shall effectively rewind the Response package ownership to the previous Reviewer without rewinding the process history (i.e. ­ the exception shall be tracked as part of the process). The Process Manager shall have the ability to Create a Package Exception that rewinds the Response Package ownership back to any Reviewer in the organizational unit or themselves, if necessary. Package Exceptions shall require a description of the reason for the exception. Concept of Operations Reviewers shall have the ability to record their approval of a Response package by changing their Reviewed status to Approved. When a Reviewer approves a Response and it is marked as Ready for Review, the Reviewer one level higher than the current Reviewer shall be given access to the Response. All Response items and the draft Response content shall be invisible to the higher level Reviewers until they have been first approved by the lower level Reviewers. Once a Response has been approved in this manner it shall remain visible to the next level of Reviewers throughout the rest of the preparation process. Concept of Operations After the Writer has completed a draft version or revision, the Response must begin the Review/Approval process. A Writer shall have the ability to mark a Response package as Ready for Review. When a Response is marked as Ready for Review, the application shall notify the lowest level Reviewer of the availability of new content and the Response shall become visible to the lowest level Reviewer.

This Contract will be awarded to the offeror representing the Best Value given price and non-price factors.  Factor weights are as follows:



Technical 			65%

Price				35%



TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

The following criteria will be applied in the technical evaluation of proposals, with each criterion area having the weighting percentage indicated below.



Critical Element

Critical Element is that the offeror proposes to perform ALL of the work indicated in the Statement of Work. This includes the performance of all the activities in Section 5, including Task 1 and 2 and the delivery of all artifacts identified in the Table of Deliverables, Section 6. 

If the Critical Technical Evaluation Element has been satisfied, the quote will be evaluated against the remaining technical factors. If the threshold of the Critical Element has not been met the proposal will not be further evaluated.



Non-critical Technical Evaluation Elements

Completeness of the Plan and Approach :		60%

Likelihood of Success:				40%



Completeness of Plan and Approach - 60%

The Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements of the project by submitting a well described plan of how they intend to meet the requirements as described in Sections 5 and 6 of the Statement of Work.  Evaluation of this element will be concerned with the approach for turning an already mature requirement into an application given the project management constraints of schedule, quality, scope, risk, and customer satisfaction.  Proposals will be evaluated to produce the highest aggregate value in these areas. 



Likelihood of Success – 40%

The Evaluation Panel will evaluate technical volumes to mitigate risks posed from the offerors. As such the Technical Evaluation Panel will consider two primary areas to mitigate risk. The first area of evaluation is in the form of relevant past performance from the Offeror. This will be evaluated by an examination of the past performance from previous projects that are of a consistent size AND scope to the work identified in this Statement of Work. The second area is in the form of the experience of personnel identified as “Key” in the Proposal. The Technical Evaluation Panel will review the experience of the “Key” personnel to identify work that they have performed that is consistent, in terms of both scope AND magnitude, with the work identified in this Statement of Work. 



Debriefings



Unsuccessful firms will be notified and will have the opportunity to request a debriefing according to the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
