The contractor shall investigate and report to the Contracting Officer or the COTR all cases of loss, damage, or destruction of Government property in its possession or control as soon as the facts become known or when requested by the Contracting Officer or the COTR.




  13.  LIABILITY



   This clause addresses liability arising beyond that which is specific to Government property.  Liability for shortages, loss, damages or destruction of Government property is addressed in the “Use of Government Property” clause of this contract.

Scope of Work for

“Webcasting Services for CFTC”





OVERVIEW



The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”) is a United States Government entity created by Congress in 1974 as an independent agency with the mandate to regulate the commodity futures and option markets in the United States. The goal of the Commission’s oversight of regulated markets is to detect and deter market manipulation, prevent customer and market abuses, and ensure that regulated entities comply with self-regulatory responsibilities. The Commission conducts financial surveillance of clearing organizations and intermediaries to promote the financial integrity of the markets and to protect customer funds.



PURPOSE

The Commission’s leases their headquarter’s facility as well as each of its Regional Office locations.  The headquarter’s facility is located in Washington, DC and the Regional Office are located in New York, NY; Chicago, IL and Kansas City, MO.  

The Commission requires that some of the meetings hosted at the headquarter’s and regional office locations be broadcast live by webcast to the general public. The contractor shall furnish video and audio webcasting services for the meetings. Additionally, the contractor shall validate the videoconference and webcasting systems prior to the meetings. 

The meetings are typically scheduled to last four hours, but could run as long as eight hours. Scheduled times will be provided prior to the events.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS

The contractor shall furnish managed video webcast services to support CFTC’s internal and external customers for the Commission's scheduled Webcast meetings. The services provided shall include video webcasting, storage, web page creation, and web hosting. (See Table 1 for the anticipated webcast schedule and required equipment for events.) 

The CFTC intends to use its existing video-teleconferencing (VTC) system to provide the live audio/video feed for the webcasts. (see Table 2) However, the system's audio component has intermittent, unresolved issues. To minimize the likelihood of a problem, the contractor shall furnish external audio and public address systems for the events. A phone line with a built-in delay shall be used as the primary source of audio. The Commission will furnish the phone line. The audio from the CFTC VTC shall be used as the secondary audio source, unless testing shows it is best to use the audio directly from the VTC system. Lip sync issues are not uncommon in webcasting, and using separate audio and video sources can make them more noticeable. The contractor shall work closely with CFTC to minimize any lip sync issues. The Commission is presently planning an upgrade to its audio-visual equipment infrastructure.  However, this upgrade is part of a larger construction project which will be occurring during the term of this contract.  CFTC will modify Table 2 as equipment is replaced.
