Performanc Work Statement (PWS)



Integrated Data Environment /

Global Transportation Network Convergence (IGC)

INFORMATICA ENTERPRISE Software maintenance

Performance Work Statement (PWS)

As of 13 April 2012 







1. Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  

a. Primary COR.



b. Alternate COR.





2.  Contract Title.  IGC Informatica Enterprise Software Maintenance



3.  Background.  The purpose of the Integrated Data Environment (IDE) / Global Transportation Network (GTN) Convergence (IGC) Program was to retire the legacy GTN system while extending backward compatibility to legacy GTN customer systems enabled by robust data integration services hosted on a modern, commercial off-the-shelf technology (COTS) based, Net Ready/Net Centric infrastructure.  The vision of IGC is to provide supply chain, distribution, and logistics information fusion through common integrated data and services to enable development of cohesive solutions for users across Department of Defense (DOD).  IGC provides a single point of access to data within the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and between DLA/USTRANSCOM and external systems; ensuring consistent access to common, authoritative logistics data, business rules, and reliable information. The IGC net-centric architecture provides patterns for design, development, deployment, and management of a loosely coupled application infrastructure.  Militarily significant capabilities are created via multiple programs utilizing the ability to publish and consume data and reusable technical and business services.



In operation today,  IGC maintains a combination of Informatica Production Central Processing Unit (CPU), Laboratory (Lab), and Recovery licenses for various PowerCenter applications.  In addition, IGC’s Enterprise Service Provider (ESP); Lockheed-Martin (LM) Corporation, procured Enterprise wide Informatica licenses for use within the IGC program, for which maintenance support will expire 6 Sept 2012.  Upon expiration, USTRANSCOM will relieve LM of maintenance responsibilities for the Enterprise licenses and will renew that maintenance for IGC, under this PWS.  





4.  Objectives:  The following are critical objectives of this PWS;



Provide IGC uninterrupted Enterprise maintenance support its unlimited Informatica software products 

Co-Term maintenance coverage to terminate within Government Fiscal (FY) boundary (e.g. 30 Sep)

Provide one option for continued maintenance support through FY13

Provide investigative analysis and problem resolution of failed and/or malfunctioning software

Provide access to new software releases as well as major and minor upgrades

Make available software baseline changes/patches/updates to IGC’s ESP

Timely response to incidents as notified by DECC and/or IGC Service Desks

Provide options for on-site Professional Services for tuning and/or complex analyses

Vendor shall not violate any existing Informatica software maintenance and/or warranties in effect for IGC

The contractor shall not require replacement of IGCs existing Informatica application code baseline

The contractor shall not alter any existing user data or reports already resident within IGC

5.  Scope.  The contractor shall provide Informatica Enterprise software maintenance for all products identified in Table 1 of this PWS.  While the typical day-to-day administration and operational support of IGCs Informatica Enterprise software is accomplished by experienced IGC System Administration staff, maintenance support is still required for problem analysis, troubleshooting, software patching, repair, as well as major and minor releases.  Technical responses to trouble calls are to be resolved in a timely manner in the event a software incident occurs.  The contractor shall provide corrective software updates to return the malfunctioning software to a normal operating state.

Table 1 - IGC Informatica Enterprise License Maintenance Requirement



6.  Performance Requirements.  



	6.1. Software Maintenance (Base):   The contractor shall provide IGC access to major and minor software releases as well as conduct remedial maintenance required to replace and/or repair a malfunctioning software component(s) and return it to an operational state.  This includes (any) unlock and/or expiring license codes  as well as access to software service packs, major and minor releases, critical hot fixes, fix packs and/or patches from the software Electronic Software Delivery (ESD) .  For routine maintenance and upgrades, windows of system availability will be pre-coordinated with the IGC PMO and/or the DECC System Administration Staff.  For critical repairs (Priority 1), the contractor shall expeditiously complete corrective actions in order to restore software to an operational state.   For on-site visits, windows of system availability will be pre-coordinated with the IGC PMO and/or ESP.  Occasionally, a problem cannot be easily attributed to the application software, its supporting network, operational servers, or other infrastructure components.  In these cases where IGC suspects the Informatica Enterprise Software to be malfunctioning, the contractor shall provide engineering support and participate (by telecom) in technical investigative discussion(s) with a team of system administrators, application engineers, network engineers, firewall administrators, program representatives, Testers, or other engineering personnel to either isolate the specific cause of the problem, or simply remove Informatica software as a contributing factor to the problem.  In the event the root cause is attributable to the Informatica, the contractor shall take corrective action to restore the software to an operational state.  Corrective action may include:



Provide guidance in locating the solution to known problem(s) or information to resolve procedural problems as well as provide answers to engineering question(s)

Provide temporary workaround procedure(s) to circumvent a problem until a code-level change is provided

Provide Emergency Bug Fix (EBF) with implementation instructions that either resolves the reported problem or provides substantive relief until a final corrective fix can be provided



6.1.1 Maintenance Coverage and Response:   All Informatica Enterprise Software maintenance support shall be at Premium support level.  When IGC requests service, we will assign a priority for each Problem Incident or Service Request based on the criteria set out below.  The priority level will be assigned for each incident or request reported.  Technician response to the reported problem is also shown in Table 2 below.

Priority 1:  Critical - A problem prohibiting use of the software or renders it inoperable, data corruption, system crashing/hanging, or critical applications are failing.

Priority 2:  Significant - A problem occurring within the software that impairs the IGC mission; however, operations can continue, albeit in a degraded fashion. 

Priority 3:  Minor - A problem within the software of routine nature or that negligibly impacts IGC’s ability to operate.

Table 2 – Maintenance Coverage / Response



For Remote Support, “Technician Response” time is measured by the interval between IGC’s initial contact and the first contact with the contractor’s maintenance support representative.  



	6.1.2 Software Service:   The contractor shall provide software access for updates, patches, and releases via the Electronic Software Delivery (ESD)  to include related support documentation for the products that are operational within IGC. 

 

	6.1.3 Primary Point of Contact:  The primary coordination point of contact regarding maintenance support is the IGC Help Desk, Phone (618) 256-6836 or EMAIL: USTC-IGCHELPDESK@USTRANSCOM.MIL



Deliverables:    Access (24x7) to Software Baseline(s), Release(s), Upgrade(s), fix(es) and fix pack(s), patches, documentation and incident reporting for IGC System Administration personnel.  



6.2 Professional Services (Option):   The contractor shall provide on-site performance tuning, configuration support, complex analysis, and/or data latency investigative services.  This includes analysis of existing deployment configuration to optimize the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) loads for data integration.  This effort requires a rudimentary understanding of IGCs business intelligence system, followed by a review of Informatica implementation, environmental settings, data processing and accuracy validation.  The contractor may recommend incremental performance adjustments followed by a short period of observation and monitoring to achieve optimal performance benchmarks.  For this task, Informatica will leverage experienced technical personnel whom have a broad understanding of industry best ETL practices for data integration and performance tuning.  An Informatica engineer will travel to O’Fallon, IL to provide on-site performance tuning.  For on-site visits, windows of system availability will be pre-coordinated with the IGC PMO and/or ESP.  The visit shall be followed up with a written report that includes analysis, (any) issues found, and tuning/optimization recommendations.



Deliverables:  Written report that includes analysis of (any) issues found with recommended corrective actions.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.



(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)



(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- 



(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- 



(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 



(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and 



(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and



(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.



(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:



(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.



(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.



(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.



(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.



(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.



(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).



(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 



(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).



(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 



(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 



(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 



(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.



(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:



(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.



(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.



(ii) Examples. 



(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.



(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.



(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.



(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
