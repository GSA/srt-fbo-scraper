The technical proposal shall contain all the required information to evaluate the Offeror's capability for performing the required services. This Volume shall consist of a summary description of the Offeror's technical approach of meeting the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work. The Technical Proposal is required to meet all requirements of the solicitation, not just the requirements of the Statement of Work, to be eligible for award. The Technical Proposal must include a discussion of your methodology to meet all the requirements of the contemplated contract. The Technical Proposal discussion shall be specific, detailed, and complete enough to clearly and fully demonstrate that you understand the requirements and the inherent problems associated with the objectives of this procurement.

The Technical Proposal must address each portion of the Statement of Work and be sufficiently detailed so as to allow the government to evaluate the feasibility of how your organization proposes to comply with the applicable Statement of Work including a full explanation of the techniques and procedures to be followed. Your proposal shall be specific and complete. The offeror is urged to examine this solicitation in its entirety and to assure that the submitted proposal contains all the necessary information and provides all required documentation and is complete in all respects. Evaluation of the proposal will be based on the actual material presented and not on the basis of what is implied. You shall ensure that your price proposal is consistent with your technical proposal in all respects since the price proposal may be used as an aid to determine the offeror understands of the technical requirements. Discrepancies may be viewed as a lack of understanding. Proposals shall provide the basis of the soundness, validity and workability of the proposed technical approach that demonstrates an understanding of the requirement listed in the Statement of Work.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered. Non-cost/price factors, when combined, are significantly more than cost/price. All non-cost/price evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance. i. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (I) Non-Cost/Price Evaluation Factors 1. Primary Factor I - UNDERSTANDING AND TECHNICAL APPROACH Subfactor I a. Extent to which the Offeror's proposal demonstrates an understanding and technical approach that will ensure successful completion of the work outlined in the Statement of work, to include the ability to effectively manage the work; the ability to complete work with high technical quality on schedule and within budget constraints; and the ability to resolve problems early in the Offer's performance to avoid slippages.

3. Primary Factor III - PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS Extent to which the Offeror's proposal demonstrates that the proposed personnel/team inclusive of any proposed subcontractors, possess the relevant qualifications including related education, experience, and training, which is reflected in the Offeror's resume submissions, as it relates to the knowledge and experience to install, modify, maintain; and upgrade, as needed, the proposed software. In addition, the Offeror shall discuss the extent to which the key personnel are familiar with the use of the proposed software. Further, the Offeror shall address the availability of key and support personnel, as well as any proposed subcontractor personnel that may be used to perform under this effort.

4. Factor IV PAST PERFORMANCE The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance on relevant current or contracts/orders completed within the past three years based on feedback from references provided by the Offeror or information that the Government otherwise obtains. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance will be considered. This comparative assessment of past performance information is separate from the responsibility determination required under Subpart 9.1. NRC may use performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the offeror/subcontractor. NRC may utilize existing databases of contractor performance information and solicit additional information from the references provided in response to the RFP and from other sources. The Offeror's past performance information will be evaluated in terms of: Quality of product or service, including consistency in meeting goals and targets; Cost control, including forecasting costs as well as accuracy in financial reporting; Timeliness of performance, including adherence to contract schedules and other time-sensitive project conditions and effectiveness of management to make prompt decisions and ensure efficient completion of tasks; Business relations, addressing the history of professional behavior and overall business-like concern for the interests of the customer, including coordination among subcontractors, cooperative attitude in remedying problems and timely completion of all administrative requirements; Customer satisfaction with performance, including end user wherever possible;

Effectiveness of key personnel, including appropriateness of personnel for the job and prompt and satisfactory changes in personnel when problems with clients where identified; Prime offerors who are not small business concerns under the NAICS code for this acquisition will be evaluated on their performance in using small business concerns as subcontractors, joint ventures and in other teaming arrangements. In cases where: (i) an offeror lacks relevant performance history; (ii) information on performance is not available; Then the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on performance and shall receive a neutral rating.

Overall, the Government will assess the relative risks associated with past performance information. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. (II) Price The Government will evaluated the offered a firm fixed price to complete the services over the base year and one option year. The total firm fixed price of the base year and the one option year will be evaluated for reasonableness. (a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.0

BACKGROUND

As a regulatory agency, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) must be able to effectively respond to a radiological/chemical release event. The NRC has chosen to invest in the human resources, training, and procedure development to handle the occurrence of such a radiological/chemical release event. NRC believes that this training is the cornerstone of effective emergency management. However, should a radiological/chemical release event occur, the addition of a near real-time (Under this requirement, lag time is defined at <15 minutes ) plume visualizing technology will place NRC in a much better position to make informed and timely decisions and this will help to ensure that public health and safety, as well as the environment are protected. Currently in the Incident Response Center, an Emergency Response Data System (ERDS) exists to monitor critical parameters affecting public health and safety. NRC requires an equivalent capability to perform an independent assessment of the hazard of chemical releases to public health and safety at fuel cycle facilities. This project is being awarded by the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS) because the response teams for incidents involving fuel cycle facilities and their associated subject matter experts reside in NMSS. Thus, NMSS is in the best position to recommend the response tools. However, the Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response (NSIR) will have the delivered software solution installed on their system for use in the Incident Response Center, as well as provide oversight and training needs to the appropriate response teams. 2.0 OBJECTIVE

The objective of this requirement is to obtain a commercial radiological/chemical plume analysis software solution that utilizes a graphical display which is informed with real-time weather data. The system shall be pre-programmed to include at least 13 fuel cycle facilities as the release points. The delivered software solution shall have the ability to utilize near real-time weather data to display a graphic prediction of the spread of the plume in near real time with the ability to provide plume migration projections. The plume, when graphically overlaid on maps of the effected area shall show the effects in user-selectable units such as Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPG), Temporary Emergency Exposure Limits, (TEELs), or Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs) on the receptors such as residents, schools and hospitals within the Continental United States of America. The NRC (NSIR) will perform initial installation of the delivered software on a stand-alone system. 4.0 SCOPE OF WORK

The NRC seeks to have the capability to assess a chemical release and predict its effects on community populations utilizing tools such as infiltration modeling at critical receptors e.g., Nearest Resident, School, Hospital, Nursing Home or Major Business. The contractor shall provide a commercial plume analysis software package containing, at a minimum, the following capabilities, and the package shall have the ability to be enhanced as described below: 1) The software's graphical display shall:

1

a) Predict and display in near real-time the dispersion of accidental or intentional releases of toxic chemical/radiological materials as defined in 40 CFR 173 b) Overlay plume graphics on a display or to show the critical receptors , roads, and major topographical features such as rivers, bays or mountain ranges; c) Calculate real-time infiltration at the critical receptors for each facility to assess the shelter-in-place effectiveness; d) Utilize near real-time weather data obtained from either a weather station at the facility or a nearby public source, such as an airport or government facility, with the ability to input the data manually if a station is not available; e) Automatically scale to plume boundaries, as well as zoom in and out on demand; and f) Include the ability to be modified to contain an NRC-controlled and generated database of hazardous materials at current fuel cycle facilities, and pre-defined release scenarios e.g., tank or piping leaks, catastrophic failure of equipment, or storage facilities,, with the ability to identify any building on any site. Currently, there are 13 fuel facilities to be modeled but the software shall be able to handle at least 120 sites

g) Security informational controls will be approved by the Office of Administration and NSIR prior to the input of fuel facility data. 2) The software shall have the ability to accept an input such as "Chlorine release (100lbs/min) in progress at the ACME Fuel Facility, Building 322, it started 10 minutes ago!" When the location is entered, the software will first find and display the facility in an aerial photograph and have the ability to shift to a graphic (GIS) presentation of the site (NRC staff will supply photos and/or graphics of buildings to be displayed on Google Earth or similar format after contract award) using a facility name input. The software shall then be able to identify and zoom-in on a specific site, and that site would be the point from which the plume graphics would emanate. 3) Minimum scenarios that the plume analysis software shall be able to analyze include: a) b) c) d) e) f) g) h) i) j) k) l) m) Gas releases Liquid releases Gas and liquid releases Stack emissions Ground level and elevated emissions Pipe leaks Tank and, tank car ruptures as well as failures of pipes leading from tanks Liquid and Gas Multicomponent modeling Back Calculation ­ to provide a release rate estimation Fire modeling Explosion modeling ­ overpressure effects Infiltration modeling ­ evaluate safe haven effect Exfiltration modeling ­ release within a structure

The system shall be compatible with Microsoft Windows XP and be forward compatible to Microsoft VISTA. The contractor shall supply a "GSM" modem with Internet connection for installation by NRC in an NRC-supplied laptop computer. This will allow an Internet connection for initial testing and remote use of the software. The following Section 508 standards apply to this acquisition: 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41. See www.section508.gov for more information. 4) Training a) The Contractor shall provide within in the first year following the award three (3) separate training sessions for up to a maximum of 15 NRC personnel at NRC Headquarters located in Rockville, MD on the use of the delivered application and the maintenance of updating of the application database. This shall include training NRC personnel in the programming of the minimum scenarios defined in 3 above. b) The software shall have the capability to be modified to enter new fixed location facilities or when given a location (e.g., address, major road / rail road crossing or latitude/longitude) to assess the effects of releases anywhere in the Continental United States of America. 7.0 TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS

The NRC anticipates three (3) Contractor trips within the first year following the award to NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, to provide training and to oversee NRC installation of the software. These meetings are expected to last three (3) days each. All other meetings will be held via teleconference, videoconference or on-line meetings utilizing "Go-to-Meeting". During Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012, the NRC anticipates two (2) Contractor trips as requested by the NRC TPM each year to NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. These meetings are expected to last two (2) days each to provide software updates and staff training. 8.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY
