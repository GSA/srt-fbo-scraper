Qualifications of proposed staff:  The Contractor’s stated expertise will be evaluated for each proposed position, and are expected to have technical expertise in website expansion, video creation, and content development.  The Contractor’s proposal should include resumes for proposed personnel who possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to fulfill the statement of work.  Where no individual is proposed (no resume), the proposed position description is appropriate to the requirements of the duties to be performed and the Offeror provides evidence of potential candidates and his or her ability to find and employ individuals with the requisite qualifications. The Offeror will be evaluated on their abilities to

Have expertise and proficiency in the use of modern web technologies, specifically in the following (although not limited to): Java, JavaScript, JavaScript MVC, CS3, HTML 4, Content Management Software Development, ASP, PHP, Cold Fusion

Create concepts for video, filming and editing video clips that meet content goals and classroom needs



Management capability:  The management capability rating provides an assessment as to the extent the management structure facilitates timely assignment and execution of work.  Offeror should provide evidence of the Offeror’s ability to successfully manage website design, media production, curriculum development contracts and subcontract operations.  The Offeror will be evaluated on their abilities to:



Comply and manage administrative aspects of the project (i.e. pay vendors, staff, etc.) 

Meet deadlines and deliverables for all project staff, vendors and sub contractors



CORPORATE EXPERIENCE:  An Offeror is expected to have at least three years of corporate and educational experience and should provide evidence of knowledge and experience working with educational institutions and how foreign affairs content complements classroom curriculum. Offerors must submit a two-to-three page (maximum) narrative describing the company's corporate and educational experience in website design, curriculum planning and production. Your company must have provided these types of services to either a government, commercial or educational entity, and should have an understanding of how to develop materials appropriate for classroom application and expertise working with educators.  The Offeror will be evaluated on their abilities to:





Organization’s number of years of corporate experience in providing the services offered 

Organization’s size, experience in the field, and resources available to enable the Offeror to fulfill requirements of the size anticipated under any resultant contract

Expertly and collaboratively work with educators and within classrooms

The table below demonstrates the ratings, and corresponding descriptions, that will be used by the Department to rate each Offeror’s technical proposal according to the evaluation factors for this contract.







 

D.   PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:  This factor will evaluate the Offeror’s past performance as an indicator of an Offeror’s ability to perform the contract. The Department will evaluate the information obtained relative to the past performance of the Offeror. In conducting the evaluation of proposals, the Department reserves the right to utilize all evaluation information available at the time of evaluation, whether provided by the Offeror in its proposal or obtained from other sources. When there is no recent/relevant performance record available or the Offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, a neutral rating will be assigned.



A copy of the past performance questionnaire have been attached





































Evaluation Criteria Rating/Description Table

Evaluation Criteria Rating/Description Table

Excellent

The Offeror exceeds the requirements of the solicitation. There is no question as to the Offeror’s ability to perform successfully. The proposal contains no deficiencies or significant weaknesses.

Good

It appears that the Offeror meets the basic requirements of the solicitation. While the proposed approach does not exceed expectations, the Offeror will most likely be able to perform successfully, though minor deficiencies or weaknesses may exist.

Marginal

The Offeror may meet the basic requirements of the solicitation, though there are doubts as to the Offeror’s ability to perform successfully. In order to make their proposal fully acceptable, they would need to correct their deficiencies or weaknesses through submission of a revised proposal.

Unacceptable

The Offeror fails to meet the basic requirements of the solicitation. There are so many deficiencies and weaknesses that, should the Offeror be allowed to correct them, it would be tantamount to submission of a new proposal. The proposal should not be considered for award.



Past Performance Rating/Description Table

Past Performance Rating/Description Table

Unknown Confidence (Neutral)

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) __ Are, __ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) __ Have, __ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) __ Are, __ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) __ Have, __ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because

Page 13 of 29 SAQMMA12R0330

it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ? 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] __ (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(f) This clause shall become inoperative upon obligation of funds sufficient to cover the full price stated in the contract, except for rights and obligations then existing under this clause.

STATEMENT OF WORK



Diplomatic Simulations:  Project Management and Outreach Initiatives

United Sates Diplomacy Center, Bureau of Public Affairs

United States Department of State



BACKGROUND



The U.S. Diplomacy Center (USDC) exists to welcome the American people and visitors from around the world to the Department of State, to explain why diplomacy matters, and to inspire future leaders to become involved.  One of the ways the USDC conducts their outreach is through the web and social media, and also through creating diplomatic simulations for educators to conduct in their classrooms. 



In a diplomatic simulation, participants step into the shoes of a diplomat to negotiate an international crisis or issue.  Here, they learn first-hand what diplomats do and how they use the tools of diplomacy through hands-on experience.  Participants work together towards agreement using the diplomatic skills of problem solving, communication and building alliances.



Instructional videos, lesson plans and virtual diplomatic simulation exercises will be downloadable from the web, making the simulation program a resource to schools across the nation.  Educators can draw from instructional materials and play videos for students of diplomats briefing on the simulation content.  The Center will invite students to post questions, lessons learned, ideas and reflections through message boards and social media platforms.  In addition, the Center will link with international volunteer and cultural organizations to invite participants to share their stories as “citizen diplomats.”



PURPOSE 



The USDC seeks a Project Manager to oversee the project cycle, phases and activities to ensure that all project goals are completed satisfactorily and that project objectives are accomplished.  The project manager will ensure the work effort and process are tailored to the type of project and values and risk of the project.  Furthermore, it is the expectation that the project is a planned effort with a performance goal, scheduled start, scheduled end and budget.  The project manager for this Diplomatic Simulation program will oversee the production of an exceptional new web resource for teachers and students that offers visitors to the State Department’s website and beyond, simulation exercises on how diplomacy works.  This web resource is part of the strategic plan in audience outreach for the U.S. Diplomacy Center which serves as the expert in diplomacy education for the American public.



The Projector Manager will manage the expansion of the USDC’s latest website, Discover Diplomacy, by adding diplomatic simulation materials specifically aimed at students and educators.  These materials are downloadable and have accompanying video clips on how to use the simulations in the classroom.



The Projector Manager will oversee the development, editing, design, video production and the day-to-day aspects of the creation of the web resource; and work alongside the USDC’s team members to guide design and audience appropriateness, and secure services and goods consistent with the project’s purpose and budget.



The Project Management team shall have expertise in managing projects, outside vendors, marketing and design, overall planning and task management, and serve as key point of contact for all team members.



The Project Management team must: 

Ensure compliance and manage the administrative aspects of the project (i.e. pay vendors, staff, etc.);

Submit monthly reports by email in PDF form to USDC staff stating goals and objectives realized and how the project plan compares to the progress to date;

Review, approve or disapprove all tasks and deliverables submitted by its vendors before final submission to USDC;

Manage all vendors and subcontractors on the project;

Act as point-of-contact and day-to-day liaison with all stakeholders; 

Assign tasks, deadlines and deliverables for all project staff, vendors and subcontractors;

Alert point-of-contact at the USDC as soon as possible of technical content problems, potential cost overruns and scheduling conflicts in the project plan.



The expansion requires the contractor to provide and/or manage the following specific efforts:



Website Expansion: The addition of a new section to the main navigation content, called “Practice Diplomacy” that would adopt the same form and navigational experience as the two current sections (Diplomacy 101 and Explore!) and the expansion of the Educator’s Resources section to include more pages of content, video, and blogging capabilities.



Instructional Video Clips: Incorporate video clips into the website expansion that instruct educators on how to incorporate a diplomatic simulation into the classroom.  Clips will also feature State Department officials who will brief viewers on the simulations’ content (the issue being negotiated). 



Education simulations: Provide an educational simulations expert who will create three diplomatic simulation materials for teachers as further described in the deliverables section.
