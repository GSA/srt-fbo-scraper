Performance Work Statement
1. PURPOSE The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) seeks an experienced industry partner to provide Computer Incident Response and Security Services in support of its critically important IT assets and infrastructure. 2. INTRODUCTION In support of its mission to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system, the OCC employs a range of sophisticated applications, business systems, and databases. Deployed assets range from mainframe applications to enterprise services including Web content management, document management, records management, knowledge management, identity management, notification services, data management and analytics, and enterprise-wide security operations. To enable its business units to easily, independently access, and use these information assets, the OCC provides a secure, high-availability data delivery platform that offers the technical infrastructure and services required to process, share, and secure the large volume of highly sensitive data used by the OCC workforce. The OCC is entrusted with, and requires access to, a great deal of sensitive personal and organizational information in the course of its examinations. Its regulatory responsibilities demand high standards for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data. The challenge is to provide consistent delivery of the highest levels of performance, availability, and reliability for mission critical systems while at the same time safeguarding OCC information and systems through sound technical and operational controls. The OCC challenge is growing on a number of fronts. The threat landscape continues to shift from easy-to-detect attacks to sophisticated and targeted attacks. Hackers and other players with malicious intent target OCC users with a blend of advanced software and social engineering. Highly sophisticated SPAM-based social engineering attacks target users' fears and anxieties around such topical issues as swine flu, the state of the economy, environmental disasters, and other topics that can ensnare the uninformed. The rise of Botnet technology, which can evade traditional anti-virus systems, and the use of malware to infiltrate users' computers make situational awareness critical to a layered security architecture. The OCC relies significantly on its Internet presence. More and more applications are being built (and reengineered) with the Internet in mind. At the same time, the OCC recognizes that no area of security is growing faster than attacks against applications. In response, the OCC is adapting its traditional defense techniques and approaches to include more focus on the application layer, requiring detailed security reviews of applications to ensure that high-risk vulnerabilities are removed prior to putting an application into production.

4. SCOPE OF WORK 4.1. General The Contractor shall furnish to the Government all necessary labor, services (non-personal), and materials (except as specified by the Government) required to accomplish the efforts as specifically set forth in this Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall perform all tasks under the technical direction of the project Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The Contractor shall interface with and coordinate with other members of the Information Technology Services (ITS) office, which is comprised of OCC employees and other Contractor personnel. The work consists of recurring activities in areas such as computer incident response, security services (such as vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, security site reviews, software testing, reporting, and forensics), and situational awareness. Services provided shall be fully compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), OMB Circular A-130 Appendix II, FIPS requirements, NIST Guidelines, and other applicable policies, regulations and statutes. The OCC is using a performance-based strategy for conducting work and procuring the specified services. Outcome-oriented goals and objectives are specified for the CIRC program, with quantitative business and technical metrics derived from these objectives. Qualitative measures provide a balance against quantitative measures when assessing the Contractor's performance. Metrics are used to determine whether OCC objectives are being achieved, to assess the Contractor's performance, to monitor trends in contractual work, and to facilitate oversight. Technical Exhibit (TE) 1 of this PWS provides the performance metrics that the OCC recognizes as pertinent to this contract, identifies what will be measured to assess program and Contractor performance, and traces performance to IRM objectives. The metrics do not include specific target values to be obtained or baseline values from which improvements can be measured. Offerors shall propose target values and expected improvement percentages appropriate for each metric in their Technical Approaches. Recommended surveillance methods shall be included where appropriate. The Contractor shall recommend specific target values to IRM within 120 days of contract commencement and, upon IRM approval, shall incorporate them into its quality control plan and processes. TE 2 presents the OCC's best estimate of expected workload using data available at the time this PWS was developed. The figures presented in TE 2 are estimates only, based on the most current information available, and not necessarily projections of total workload. They are provided as reasonable estimates or as examples (not inclusive) of past workload and factors that CircPWS072910.doc  Page 6 

demonstrate the type and/or extent of effort that can reasonably be expected. The Contractor is advised that the estimated value of each workload factor is not a guarantee of future workload. TE 3 contains the list of significant Contract deliverables. TE 4 presents the pertinent securityrelated documents. As with the workload factors in TE2, the Contractor is advised that these are representative samples whose contents and requirements may change during the Contract's period of performance.

5. SPECIFIC TASKS 5.1. Information Incident Response The OCC's computer incident response capability must provide rapid response in the event of a security incident. Damage must be assessed and contained quickly; customer data protected; the root cause found; and, an accurate record of events and losses generated. It is a high-profile responsibility, since it puts IRM in direct contact with customers and involves the cooperation of several different work areas. Intrusion detection, virus protection, and other investigative responsibilities, such as forensics, data analysis, customer follow up, and briefings are all essential elements of securing the OCC enterprise-computing environment. The Contractor shall staff and conduct a computer incident response program that complies with NIST guidelines, OCC policy and Treasury information security policy. Current OCC-supported tools and processes are identified in TE 6. Representative activities shall include: ˇ Manage and operate the OCC's audit logging infrastructure.

Provide expert opinion on current audit logging strategy for all OCC systems and assist with and execute as needed improvements to current strategy. Database Reporting

5.3.

The OCC employs a custom-developed, Oracle-based audit logging and information security database named "CALM" to provide an in-depth perspective on the changing threat landscape and to support IRM incident management processes. CALM collects data from servers and system logs of VPN gateways, proxy, the central IPS, wireless access points and firewalls and serves as the foundation of the OCC's security intelligence capability. Scheduled and ad hoc reports are routinely generated to support intrusion detection and prevention activities, as well as CircPWS072910.doc  Page 9 

anomaly discovery and investigation. Additional information about the existing CALM system is provided in TE 5. The Contractor shall provide scheduled and ad hoc database reporting services to enable IRM to easily access and use CALM-stored information to support data analysis, decision making, and information presentation needs out of the current Oracle-based system (known as CALM), which is in the process of being transitioned to Microsoft SQL Server 2008 by the end of calendar year 2010. NOTE: The following tasks are designated as optional tasks to be executed at the discretion of the OCC. 5.4. Access Management ­ Optional Task The Contractor shall provide a process or solution on system and network user accounts and passwords related to the age of passwords, the current status of privileged user accounts, user accounts in Active Directory group policy, and audit-related activities. The Contractor's solution shall include reporting formats and frequencies to accomplish this task. This solution shall provide a full accounting of all user accounts and passwords, including service accounts as well as non-Active Directory related IDs associated with mainframe systems (2 systems) and missionrelated applications (approximately 15). A listing of anticipated reporting solution requirements is provided in TE 7. 5.5. Situational Awareness ­ Optional Task

Situational awareness refers to the capability to maintain a constant vigil over important information, understand the relationship among the various pieces of information monitored, and project this understanding into the near future to make critical decisions. Situational awareness includes being observant of one's surroundings and identifying potential threats and dangerous situations and taking proper steps to safeguard oneself, the OCC, and the data and systems we are entrusted with. Situational Awareness is not a system, a network, or an application; rather it is a set of processes to be adopted and employed by anyone entrusted with access to OCC information. A well functioning situational awareness process is composed of practices that focus on the human factor- such as training, briefings, correlation between security systems and the threats they protect OCC from-in such a manner as to make informed decisions, act in a timely manner, and ultimately ensure operational safety. Failures to maintain situational awareness can lead to inadequate decision making and ultimately to realized threats against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of OCC information and systems. The Contractor's solution may leverage, but is not limited to, the OCC's existing systems and resources used to collect threats, vulnerabilities, operational statistics, trends, alerts, and other risk-based information from disparate sources (including logging), in order to process the data according to OCC priorities, and report the information in an easy-to-understand manner. The Contractor's proposed solution shall address the process for implementing and managing the solution with the necessary supporting incident management and analytical expertise to enable CircPWS072910.doc  Page 10 

IRM to meet its situational awareness objectives in an agile and cost-effective manner. The Contractor's solution shall demonstrate the process and approach for meeting the following functional requirements: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Promote enhanced analysis and decision-making by allowing the user to drill down from high-level, summarized charts and displays to the underlying detailed source data and systems. Provide current reporting of the global emerging cyber threat assessment and industryproven defenses to enhance OCC information security intelligence and proactive operational response capability. Establish a key risk indicator program that communicates operational, compliance and technical risk to all levels of OCC management. Provide timely problem analysis to detect and disseminate emerging trends and relationships among seemingly discrete events to enhance OCC information security intelligence and proactive operational response capability. Leverage the OCC's situational awareness capability to enhance the OCC's training and awareness program. Utilize the alerts, briefings & recommendations from the situational awareness capability to enhance OCC policy.

6. CONSTRAINTS 6.1. Operational Controls The Contractor shall adhere to the following controls: ˇ ˇ Any activities that may degrade the performance of network environments, operating systems, databases and applications must be performed outside of normal business hours. All products and deliverables must be provided in a format supported by the OCC's available tools to support future updates unless otherwise agreed to by the COTR and CO. Program Management

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) With the passage of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, there is no longer a statutory provision to allow for agencies to waive mandatory Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The waiver provision had been included in the Computer Security Act of 1987; however, FISMA supersedes that Act. Therefore, the references to the "waiver process" contained in many of the FIPS listed below are no longer operative. Note, however, that not all FIPS are mandatory; consult the applicability section of each FIPS for details. FIPS do not apply to national security systems (as defined in FISMA). ˇ FIPS PUB 102 Guideline for Computer Security Certification & Accreditation, September 1983 (1st of 7 parts http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips102/f102a.pdf) (2nd of 7 parts http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips102/f102b.pdf) (3rd of 7 parts http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips102/f102c.pdf) (4th of 7 parts http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips102/f102d.pdf) (5th of 7 parts http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips102/f102e.pdf) (6th of 7 parts http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips102/f102f.pdf) (7th of 7 parts http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips102/f102g.pdf) FIPS PUB 199 Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems, December 2003 (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/draft-fipspub-199.pdf) FIPS PUB 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, December 2002 http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf Link to other FIPS Publications (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/)

TECHNICAL EXHIBIT 5: OCC's CALM Database Application The OCC maintains an internal application for data log aggregation and analysis for information security event monitoring. The application was built using Oracle Application Express (APEX) operating on Oracle 11g Standard Edition in standalone mode. The application is used to review information security-related data from a variety of syslog sources (e.g., firewalls), other commercial off the shelf software suites (via ODBC), and connect (as read-only or to create Materialized Views) to other, non-Oracle database instances (e.g., Microsoft SQL). The primary role of the application is to analyze data for the purposes of intrusion detection and prevention, as well as anomaly discovery and investigation purposes. Data parsing is performed using triggers to format and normalize the data after which it's inserted into tables. The majority of data (~ 95 percent) does not change once it is put into the tables. The current database is over 1TB in size and 30 million rows of data are inserted every day. The OCC expects data input to increase ten fold over the next 12 months. This database will be migrated to Microsoft SQL Server 2008.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires all service providers to have an information se curity program that provides management, operational, and technical safeguards designed to protect OCC data. This publication is based on security control requirements established by Federal Information Process ing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." Once completed, this self assessment will be analyzed by OCC information Risk Management personnel to provide the OCC's contracting officer with a preliminary assessment of the respondents' security program. OCC's analysis will rely on the quality and completeness of the information provided. OCC Risk Management person nel will conduct further analyses, review, and testing of the apparent winning bidder's security control environment based on a full set of control requirements. Explanation of terms, concepts, and other items related to federal information security requirements can be found in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section of this publication.

4. Frequently Asked Questions
(1)  Why does the OCC require its service providers to complete this self assessment questionnaire? (5)  How does the government define "security control"? The E-Government Act of 2002 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directives require that all information systems that process government information maintain adequate security. "Adequate security" is commensurate with the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of information. Adequate security ensures that systems and applications operate effectively and provide appropriate measures of confidentiality, integrity, and availability through the use of managerial, operational, and technical security controls. This requirement applies to all information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the government, including those provided or managed by another government agency, contractor, or other source. (2)  What does "information security" mean? "Information security" is protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. (3)  What does "information system" mean? An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, transmission, and dissemination of information, in accordance with defined procedures, whether automated or manual. (4)  What do the terms "confidentiality, integrity and availability" mean? The OCC's information security controls are based on Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system and its information. Management controls focus on the management of risk and the management of information system security. Operational controls are those safeguards that are primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). Technical controls are primarily implemented and executed by an information system through mechanisms in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system. (6)  What is FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems," and where can I find more information about it?

That publication is a mandatory standard (it cannot be waived) developed in response to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 establishes the foundation for most federal information security practices and procedures. (7)  What is NIST Special Publication (SP) 80053, Revision II, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems," December 2007 and where can I find more information on it?

Confidentiality is preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. Integrity is protecting information from improper modification or destruction, and includes ensuring that information is authentic and reliable. Availability is ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.

That publication provides guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government. These guidelines apply to all components of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The publication provides guidance to federal agencies implementing FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems."

What are the standards and guides used to create this preliminary self-assessment?

This questionnaire is derived from FIPS publication 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." (9)  Can a service provider obtain the standards and guides?

NIST information security-related publications can be obtained free of charge from the NIST public Web site located at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/index.html. (10)  Where can I get assistance if I need help completing this assessment? If you have any questions concerning the completion of this form, please contact the OCC Information Risk Management Office at (202) 874-4480.

The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) shall determine whether or not contractor personnel must obtain an HSPD-12-compliant security badge (referred to as a SmartID). Generally, contractor personnel who require regular access to an OCC facility or require access to OCC information systems, either from an OCC facility or remotely, will require a SmartID. Contractor personnel who are required to obtain a SmartID must provide all required data and complete all procedures necessary for issuance of a SmartID. Contractor personnel must complete the personal identity verification process (PIV) and the contractor personnel's background investigations must be favorably adjudicated before they can receive a SmartID. Contractor personnel must appear in person twice to receive a SmartID. At the first appearance, contractor personnel will complete the personal identity verification process have their photograph taken, have their fingerprints taken, and complete enrollment for a SmartID. At the second appearance, contractor personnel will receive and activate their SmartID. Failure to obtain a SmartID in a timely fashion could prevent contractor personnel from beginning work as required under this contract. Contractor personnel shall work with the COTR and the Critical Infrastructure and Security (CIPS) staff to obtain their SmartID in a timely fashion.

Contractor personnel must surrender their SmartID upon demand of the COTR or the Personnel Security Officer. Contractor personnel must return their SmartID to the COTR upon completing work under the contract, or at any other time if for any reason they no longer require a SmartID. SmartIDs are the property of the Government. Contractor personnel should safeguard SmartIDs against loss, theft, and damage. Lost or stolen SmartIDs must be reported immediately to CIPS.

Complete the personal identity verification (PIV) process 2. Have their fingerprint taken for a background investigation 3. Obtain an OCC-issued security badge 4. Enroll for an HSPD-12-compliant security badge (referred to as a SmartID) 5. Receive and activate a SmartID. Generally, one or more of these activities are completed during a single in-person appearance. An individual typically requires two in-person appearances to complete all tasks, but more in-person appearances may be required under some circumstances. The location at which contractor personnel must appear depends on the contract place of performance and security badge requirements. Generally, contractor personnel performing work in the Washington, DC area will be required to appear at the OCC Headquarters building. Contractor personnel working elsewhere will generally be required to appear at a USAccess credentialing center operated by the General Services Administration (GSA). (A list of GSA-operated credentialing centers can be found at http://www.fedidcard.gov/deployoss.aspx.) Contractor personnel requiring in person appearances at an OCC facility will schedule their appearance with the COTR or an authorized representative. The COTR or an authorized representative will escort contractor personnel while they are in the OCC facility.

______________ _________________ [List as necessary] (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of

48

Computer Incident Response Center ­ Security Services CC-10-HQ-R-0053

the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1

52.212-2 EVALUATION ­ COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1: Technical Approach Factor 2: Offeror Profile/Key Personnel Factor 3: Past Performance Factor 4: Price When all of the non-price factors (1-3) are combined, they are significantly more important than price (4). (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. M.2 ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 ­EVALUATION ­COMMERCIAL ITEMS

As stated in 52.212-2, entitled Evaluation ­ Commercial Item, the factors that shall be used to evaluate the offers are technical approach, Offeror profile/key personnel, past performance, and price with award being made to the Offeror who provide the best overall value to the Government. This addendum serves to further define both the evaluation process and evaluation factors. M.2.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA Evaluation of Proposals Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth below to determine the Offeror's demonstrated ability to provide the required services. The Government will conduct a full evaluation of the technical and price proposals in accordance with the stipulated evaluation criteria. To be responsive the Offeror must

62

Computer Incident Response Center ­ Security Services CC-10-HQ-R-0053

address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. Proposals that require substantial revisions because of significant omissions of information requested in the RFP, restate the requirements or statements from the RFP, or simply state that the Offeror's proposal is compliant with the RFP, without providing a description of the approaches, techniques, methodology or solutions may not be considered among the most highly rated proposals within the competitive range, if a competitive range is established. Proposals that fail to address all solicitation requirements may be considered deficient or unacceptable and may be excluded from further evaluation. M.2.2 BASIS FOR AWARD This is a best value acquisition as described in FAR 15.101-1. Offerors are cautioned that award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced Offeror. Rather, in accordance with the concept of "best value", the government reserves the right to pay a price premium for a proposal that is superior under the non-price factors. However, as Offerors approach parity under the non-price factors, price may become a determinative factor in the award decision. The Government may incorporate various portions of the winning Offeror's proposal into the resulting contract. The Government reserves the right to make one award or no award, depending upon the quality of the proposal submitted, the availability of funds, and the estimated number of tasks. OCC will not, in any case, make award to an Offeror it considers to have substandard capabilities or unreasonable prices. Following the evaluation of the final revised proposal, the Government will make an award to the responsible Offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria. M.2.3 COMPETITIVE RANGE The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of the initial offers received, without conducting discussion, in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(f), Contract Award. Therefore, initial offers should contain the Offeror's best terms from both a technical and pricing perspective. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by Contracting Officer to be necessary. Following the evaluation of the technical and price/business proposals, a competitive range determination may be made. This range will be comprised of the most highly rated Offerors. The Government may also reduce the number of highly rated proposals within the competitive range for purposes of efficiency in accordance with FAR 15.306. Discussions will be conducted with all vendors within the competitive range. Following discussions, all Offerors still within the competitive range may be requested to submit a written Final Revised Proposal. Offerors may be eliminated from the competitive range at any time if they are found unacceptable in one or more evaluation factors.

M.2.4 EVALUATION FACTORS The following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance, will be used to assess each proposal: Factor 1: Technical Approach Technical approach shall be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror clearly demonstrated technical experience, technical understanding, and approach to this project as it relates to the PWS objectives and tasks. The Government will evaluate the suitability of the Offeror's proposed solution for the tasks and assess the quality of the solution, likelihood of the solution's success, inherent risk, methodology for approaching the solution, and overall understanding of the requirement. The Government will assess the Offeror's ability to provide a complete and integrated solution to the full scope and breadth of the PWS requirements and the adequacy of the Offeror's quality assurance plan to ensure quality controls are in place, which satisfy the Government's stated Performance Requirements Summary and will result in tasks completed in a timely and satisfactory manner. Factor 2: Offeror Profile and Key Personnel Experience The Government will evaluate each Offeror's company profile and key personnel experience based on its breadth, depth and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective contract, based on the experience information provided by the Offeror. The Government may evaluate the experience of the Offeror's proposed key subcontractors in the same manner as the prime contractor to the extent warranted Factor 3: Past Performance The Government will evaluate the Offeror's recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the PWS. The Offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar work, including customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing stated goals. If the Offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance or does not have any past performance information available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral. The Government may evaluate the past performance of the Offeror's proposed key subcontractors in the same manner as the prime contractor to the extent warranted. The Offeror will be given an opportunity to comment on negative third party past performance information. The Government reserves the right to utilize information from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Contractor Performance System (CPS), OCC's experience, if any, with the contractor; and any other source determined appropriate by the OCC. Factor 4: Price Price will be evaluated, but will not receive an adjectival rating. The Government will evaluate the total price proposed for each performance period (i.e. base and all option

64

Computer Incident Response Center ­ Security Services CC-10-HQ-R-0053

years) to determine price reasonableness as it relates to the technical requirements and to assist in the best value determination. The Price Proposal will be evaluated for accuracy, completeness and reasonableness. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing pursuant to FAR 15.404-1 (g) (3). The Offeror's responses will be evaluated for technical adequacy of the response in conjunction with the total price and to determine whether it is fair and reasonable. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's use of the proposed labor categories and rates in their response. The Government will evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the labor rates as compared to industry norms such as the GSA Federal Supply Schedule or other government wide acquisition contracts.
