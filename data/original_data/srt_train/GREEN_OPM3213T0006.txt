These actions take place at the time of, and not before, the contract is awarded. Contract award, in this case, means signature of the contractual document by the Contracting Officer and forwarding of the contractual document to the contract awardee.

(b) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure must include a description of actions, which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict. (c) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (d) The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer. (e) In the event that a requirement changes in such a way as to create a potential conflict of interest for the Contractor, the Contractor must: (1) Notify the Contracting Officer of a potential conflict, and; (2) Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or (3) Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will: (i) Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and (ii) Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means. (4) The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed. (5) If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.

These actions take place at the time of, and not before, the contract is awarded. Contract award, in this case, means signature of the contractual document by the Contracting Officer and forwarding of the contractual document to the contract awardee. If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded. 1752.209-74 Organizational Conflicts of Interest (July 2005)

(b) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure must include a description of actions, which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict. (c) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (d) The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer. (e) In the event that a requirement changes in such a way as to create a potential conflict of interest for the Contractor, the Contractor must: (1) Notify the Contracting Officer of a potential conflict, and; (2) Recommend to the Government an alternate approach which would avoid the potential conflict, or (3) Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will: (i) Describe in detail the changed requirement that creates the potential conflict of interest; and (ii) Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means. (4) The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed. (5) If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.

For that reason the contractor must: (1) Immediately following contract award, provide to the distribution list "System Access Control" (systemaccesscontrol@opm.gov) an initial and complete list of employee's names that require access to OPM information systems; and (2) By the fifth day of each month thereafter, send a staffing change report to the Contracting Officer's Representative, contract administrator and systemaccesscontrol@opm.gov on a monthly basis. A template for the submission is attached. The report must contain the listing of all staff members who left or were hired under this contract in the past 60 days. This form must be submitted even if no separation has occurred during this period. Failure to submit a `Contractor Staffing Change Report' each month will result in the suspensions of all user ids associated with this contract. 1752.239-73 Section 508 Standards (July 2005)

(a) All electronic and information technology (EIT) procured through this RFQ must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists. 36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm. (b) The following standards have been determined to be applicable to this RFQ: (1) 1194.21. Software applications and operating systems. (2) 1194.22.

1194.24 Video and multimedia products. 1194.26 Desktop and portable computers.

(c) The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device, but merely require the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible if so required by the agency in the future (d) OPM is required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d), to offer access to electronic and information technology for disabled individuals within its employ, and for disabled members of the public seeking information and services. This access must be comparable to that which is offered to similar individuals who do not have disabilities. Standards for complying with this law are prescribed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board ("The Access Board"). (e) The current deliverable(s) must incorporate these standards as well as any agency specific standards developed by OPM. The attached technical description contains further information on how this is to be done. Your response to the solicitation should contain documentation of your compliance with these standards. However, the Contracting Officer may request additional technical documentation, if necessary to make this determination. (f) The final work product must include documentation that the deliverable conforms with the Section 508 Standards promulgated by the US Access Board.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
