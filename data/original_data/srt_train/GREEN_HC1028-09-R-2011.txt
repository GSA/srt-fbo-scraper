2.  Task Order Title.

DoD Charge and Payment Card Analytical, Technical and Program Support Services

3.  Background.

The OSD Acquisition and Technology’s, Deputy Director for Program Development and Implementation (PDI) is responsible for functional process,
policy, and data requirements for all DoD-wide procurement E-business initiatives and systems, the Unique Identification (UID) Program, and
development and implementation of DoD-specific policies and processes related to the management of the government purchase card program.  PDI
works hand in hand with the DoD Components and the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to ensure functional process, policy, and data
requirements are incorporated in DoD-wide procurement-related business initiatives and systems (such as Wide Area Workflow). In addition, E-
business represents the Department's requirements with the federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) portfolio of programs (including CCR
and FPDS).

The Department of Defense (DoD) Unique Identification (UID) & Purchase Card (PC) Joint Program Management Office (PMO) reports directly to PDI
and is responsible for leading and managing the DoD PC program.  In carrying out its mission, the DoD UID/PC PMO:

      - Identifies program requirements
      - Develops and deploys new electronic systems and other management tools
      - Ensures seamless integration of new and existing electronic systems
      - Develops and disseminates DoD-wide policies
      - Tracks and reports performance measures
      - Responds to Congressional inquiries and other program findings
      - Manages DoD’s relationship with purchase card issuing banks
      - Improves program operation and appropriately expands charge and payment card use
      - Coordinates with other charge card program offices and authorized program representatives DoD-wide to implement and integrate systems,
       streamline policy and guidance, and unify practices where appropriate

The Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force and the Defense Components’ charge card (including purchase cards, travel cards, and fuel cards)
program offices and authorized program representatives:

      - Lead and manage their respective Charge Card programs
      - Develop and deploy new electronic systems and other management tools
      - Ensure seamless integration of new and existing electronic systems
      - Contribute to the development of DoD-wide charge and payment card policy, guidance and tools
      - Develop and disseminate Service/Component-level policy, guidance and tools
      - Track and report performance measures
      - Respond to inquiries and other program findings
      - Take actions necessary to improve program operation and appropriately expand use of charge and payment cards

This effort is required to provide specific technical expertise that is currently unavailable within the Government.  This requirement is
currently being met for the UID/PC PMO under T&M Contract W91QV1-04-C-0011 which was awarded to Logistics Management Institute on 9 Sep 2004.
Additionally, purchase order N00189-07-P-Z049 was awarded to Alpha Scientific Laboratories, Inc. on 13 Nov 2006 to meet specialized short term
technical support requirements.  Several of the Defense Components have contractual vehicles in place for these type of support services,
however, several Defense Component Program Offices and Authorized Program Representatives are unable to acquire the analytical, technical and
program support services necessary to appropriately support their missions due to lack of resources to support the acquisition process.  This
will not be a Requirements Contract.

The work required under this contract will, at times, build directly upon work performed under the on-going contract (e.g., annual guidebook
updates).  However, other efforts will be “new starts”, except they may draw upon analyses and studies previously performed and delivered to the
Government; any such materials will be made available to the contractor as required for task completion.

4.  Objectives:

This effort is required to provide specific technical expertise related to charge and payment cards that is currently unavailable within the
Government.  The objective is to receive reliable, timely, actionable analytical, technical and program support to allow the DoD UID / PC PMO
and  Defense Component Program Offices and Authorized Program Representatives to accomplish their missions.

5.  Scope.

The DoD UID/PC PMO requires a Task Order, Firm Fixed Price contract consisting of a base year plus four (4) option years be awarded for Charge
and Payment Card Analytical, Technical and Program Support Services.  The contractor shall use their experience and expertise with DoD, its
electronic acquisition and financial management systems, and management and operation of charge card programs in the unique circumstances DoD
operates (e.g., in theater and at sea) to provide analytical, technical and program support, perform studies and analyses, make recommendations
and develop draft documents related to charge and payment cards.  Task Orders against this contract will be placed by the DoD UID/PC PMO and the
Departments of the Navy, Army and Air Force and the Defense Components’ charge card program offices and authorized program representatives
(Includes Purchase, Travel and Fuel Cards).

Section F - Deliveries or Performance

F.1. TASK ORDER PERF PERIOD
F.1.  TASK ORDER (TO) PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND PRICING (MAR 2001).

a.  TOs may be issued during any of the contract years.  The performance period for each TO will be specified in the TO and may extend beyond
expiration date of this contract.

b.  TOs shall be priced using the Section B rates that will be applicable to the TO’s anticipated period of performance.  For purpose of task
orders issued during the final year of this contract (or any subsequent 6-month option for continued service), the final contract year’s pricing

Section G - Contract Administration Data

TASK ORDER PROCEDURES
G.1  TASK ORDER PROCEDURES (DEC 2006) (DITCO/PL8312).

The following defines the process by which task orders (TO) will be processed and priced, and how a TO will be awarded.  Careful attention
should be paid to those areas in which the procedures, processes and provisions change due to use of a different contract types or pricing
methodology.

      a.  Selection Criteria for Awarding a Task Order.  The Government will evaluate technical proposals for technical sufficiency, and prices
against the established labor and mark-up rates from the labor rate table.   In addition, all other direct costs (ODCs) will be evaluated for
relevance and reasonableness.  The Government’s award decision will be based, as a minimum, on compliance with Section 508 requirements of the
Rehabilitation Act, and on the evaluation of technical/ management approach and cost.

      b.  Proposal Process.

      (1)  Request for Proposals (RFP).  The KO solicits proposals from the contractor through an RFP. The contractors will typically allowed
between 5-10 days to prepare and submit proposals (may be more depending upon the complexity of the requirement).  Each RFP will indicate the
proposal due date and  applicability of Section 508 standards.  Technical proposals will be written.  Cost proposals must always be submitted in
writing.  The KO will submit a request for proposal (RFP) to the contractor for each task order requirement at the time it is received from the
customer agency/COR.  The announcement will include, at a minimum, the following information:

    * End User Customer Agency and Point of Contact (POC) (Task Monitor)
    * Statement of Work (SOW), Statement of Objectives (SOO) or Performance Work Statement (PWS)
    * Anticipated Contract Type
    * Contracting Agency POC Name Phone Number and Fax (KO and Contract Specialist)
    * E-mail Address, Mailing Address or Fax Number
    * Proposal Due Date


      (2)  Clarifications.  The contractors may request written clarification of requirements.  Such requests for clarification must be sent to
the KO by e-mail.  Only the Contracting Officers may communicate verbally with the contractor concerning the RFP until after TO award.  The KO
will answer clarification requests.  As a result of clarification requests, the KO will determine if any revisions to SOW requirements are
required, and if necessary, issue an Amendment to the request for proposals.  The KO may extend the proposal due date in the event that written
clarification is not provided to the contractors in a timely manner.

      (3)  Technical Proposals.  Written technical proposals will be streamlined, normally no more than 10 pages (depending upon the complexity
of the requirement), stating compliance with or exception to SOW or PWS requirements, risks, assumptions and conflict of interest issues.
Proposals shall not merely restate SOW or PWS requirements.  The technical proposal shall address, as a minimum:

      * Technical Approach
      * Key Personnel
      * Quantities/hours of personnel by labor categories
      * Other Direct Costs (ODCs)
      * Risks
      * Period of Performance
      * Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE) and/or Government-Furnished Information (GFI) (if applicable)
      * Teaming Arrangement to include subcontracting, if applicable.

      (4)  Cost Proposals.  A written cost proposal will always be required.  This part of the proposal shall include detailed cost/price
amounts of all resources required to accomplish the task, (i.e. labor hours, rates, travel, incidental equipment, etc.).  The level of detail
required shall be primarily based on the contract type planned for use, as further discussed below.

      (i)  Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The proposal shall identify labor categories in accordance with the Labor Rate Tables contained in Section
B, and the number of hours required for performance of the task.  The proposal must identify and justify use of all non-labor cost elements.  It
must also identify any GFE and/or GFI required for task performance.  If travel is specified in the TO statement of work, air fare and/or local
mileage, per diem rates by total days, number of trips and number of contractor employees traveling shall be included in the cost proposal.
Prior to incurring any long distance travel expenses, the contractor shall obtain written approval from the TM that approves approximate travel
dates, expected duration, origin and destination, purpose, estimated costs and the number and names of personnel traveling.  Travel costs will
be in reimbursed in accordance with the Government’s Joint Travel Regulation.  Proposed materials costs shall, when requirements for materials
are sufficiently defined by the task order statement of work, include sufficient break-out of all materials, including description, brand name,
model/part number and number of units that can be verified as fair and reasonable.

      (ii)  Other Direct Cost Limitations.  This contract is primarily for technical support services; however, material not priced in Section B
may be required.  Any material purchased to support individual task orders must be incidental to (and directly support) the services and/or
solutions identified in the task order statement of work.

      (iii)  Other Relevant Information.  This information shall always be in writing and shall address other relevant information as required
by the contract or TO RFP.  The contractor shall assume all costs associated with preparation of proposals for task order awards as an indirect
charge.  The Government will not reimburse cost for proposal preparation as a direct charge.

      c.  Other Considerations.

      (1)  The Contracting Officer is not required to synopsize orders under this contract.

      (2)  The contract rates contained in Section B have been determined to be fair and reasonable based upon adequate price competition during
the award of the basic contract.  These contract rates shall be used by the contractor as the basis for developing proposals.

      (3)  Performance based work statements shall be used to the maximum extent practical.

      (4)  The contractor shall work in partnership with the Government to close out orders as soon as possible after they are physically
complete by using the “Quick-Closeout” procedures described herein as much as practical.

     d.  Task Order Issuance.  Task orders may be issued by e-mail, regular mail or facsimile using a DD Form 1155, Order for Supplies and
Services.  TOs may also be issued as an unsigned Electronic Task Order (ETO) via electronic commerce.  It is anticipated that all TOs will be
issued as ETOs via electronic commerce.  Initially, ETOs will be issued via electronic mail, and eventually, via Electronic Commerce/Electronic
Data Interchange (EC/EDI).  The contractor may be required to register in the Electronic Data Access (EDA) web site at
http://eda.ogden.disa.mil/ to obtain copies of TOs.

      e.  Unauthorized Work.  The contractor is not authorized at any time to commence task order performance prior to issuance of a signed TO
or other written approval provided by the KO to begin work.

      f.  Task Funding Restrictions.  No unfunded tasks are allowed.

      g.  Contract Closeout.  Final invoice shall be submitted within ninety (90) calendar days following the end of the Period of Performance.
When the bilateral modification to closeout the specific TO is forwarded to the contractor, it shall be signed and returned to the respective KO
within 10 working days of modification submittal.  For specific task orders, these dates can be revised at the discretion of the KO.

                                                                 (End of Clause)




G.2. TASK ORDS ISSUED AT AWARD
G.2.  ISSUANCE OF TASK ORDERS AT CONTRACT AWARD.

One task order will be issued concurrently with the contract award.  It is anticipated, that this task orders will be issued under the following
task order number and title.  Task Order 0001 is will be issued using a Firm Fixed Price pricing arrangement.

Task Order 0001:  DoD UID/PC PMO Charge and Payment Card Analytical, Technical and Program Support Services.

Any changes (additions or deletions) to the task order anticipated to be issued at contract award will be identified in section M of this
solicitation.  This task order will be issued for a 12 month period.  Four one-year option periods are anticipated for this task order.  In

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

representative before the SAR exercises such authority.

change to this contract.  Except for changes identified as such in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall notify
the Administrative Contracting Officer in writing, within 10 calendar days from the date that the Contractor identifies any Government conduct
(including actions, inactions, and written or oral communications) that the Contractor regards as a change to the contract terms and conditions.
On the basis of the most accurate information available to the Contractor, the notice shall state--

(1) The date, nature, and circumstances of the conduct regarded as a change;

(2) The name, function, and activity of each Government individual and Contractor official or employee involved in or knowledgeable about such
conduct;

(3) The identification of any documents and the substance of any oral communication involved in such conduct;

(4) In the instance of alleged acceleration of scheduled performance or delivery, the basis upon which it arose;

(ii) What labor or materials or both have been or may be added, deleted, or wasted by the alleged change;

(iii) To the extent practicable, what delay and disruption in the manner and sequence of performance and effect on continued performance have
been or may be caused by the alleged change;

this contract to the maximum extent possible in accordance with its terms and conditions as construed by the Contractor, unless the notice
reports a direction of the Contracting Officer or a communication from a SAR of the Contracting Officer, in either of which events the
Contractor shall continue performance; provided, however, that if the Contractor regards the direction or communication as a change as described
in (b) above, notice shall be given in the manner provided.  All directions, communications, interpretations, orders and similar actions of the
SAR shall be reduced to writing and copies furnished to the Contractor and to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer shall
countermand any action which exceeds the authority of the SAR.

(d) Government response.  The Contracting Officer shall promptly, within 10 calendar days after receipt of notice, respond to the notice in
writing.  In responding, the Contracting Officer shall either--

(1) Confirm that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice constitutes a change and when necessary direct the mode of further performance;

(2) Countermand any communication regarded as a change;

(3) Deny that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice constitutes a change and when necessary direct the mode of further performance; or

(4) In the event the Contractor's notice information is inadequate to make a decision under (1), (2), or (3) above, advise the Contractor what

(1) If the Contracting Officer confirms that Government conduct effected a change as alleged by the Contractor, and the conduct causes an
increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether
changed or not changed by such conduct, an equitable adjustment shall be made--

(i) In the contract price or delivery schedule or both; and

(ii) In such other provisions of the contract as may be affected.

the Government is responsible, the equitable adjustment shall include the cost and time extension for delay reasonably incurred by the
Contractor in attempting to comply with the defective drawings, designs or specifications before the Contractor identified, or reasonably should
have identified, such defect.  When the cost of property made obsolete or excess as a result of a change confirmed by the Contracting Officer
under this clause is included in the equitable adjustment, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of disposition
of the property.  The equitable adjustment shall not include increased costs or time extensions for delay resulting from the Contractor's
failure to provide notice or to continue performance as provided, respectively, in (b) and (c) above.

or incentive contracts, or to combinations thereof.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that
--

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

      (2)   All parts shall be submitted in Adobe Acrobat, Portable Document Format (PDF), Version 5.0. The font type shall either be Times New
         Roman or Arial Narrow, no smaller than 10-Point. It is recommended that the electronic PDF file be no larger than 1MB.

      (3)   Any other attached documents requested herein shall be compatible with Microsoft (MS) Office 2000 format. All pricing spreadsheets
         shall be submitted in MS Excel Office 2000 version software. Any graphics files embedded within the MS documents shall be provided in
         either *.jpg or *.pcx format in order to minimize memory storage requirements for electronic files. Landscape pages shall face right.
         It is recommended that the sum of all MS document files be no larger than 1MB compressed. Compression tools are limited to PKZip or
         WinZip.

c.   Electronic Submission.  Use of software and procedures described in this section will reduce the amount of time and effort needed by the
  Government to receive and install proposals into an electronic evaluation system and will help to insure that proposals are suitable for
  reading electronically. Information regarding electronic products listed herein should not be construed as Government endorsement for such
  products.

      (1)   Efforts by the Government to clarify or expedite installation of electronic proposal submissions, in accordance with FAR 15.207(c),
         will not be considered discussions.

      (2)   The Government will access the softcopy versions of the Offeror’s proposal over the Internet using the DecisionPoint(TM) source
         selection tool. Provided by AcqCenter.com (http://www.acqcenter.com).

      (3)   As indicated above, and expected as otherwise identified, all proposal parts shall be submitted in Adobe Acrobat PDF, Version 5.0.
         Offerors shall use the Acrobat Link feature for cross-references that are electronically linked, and linked files must be contained in
         the same directory. The Acrobat Bookmark feature may also be used for document navigation; however, use of the Acrobat Notes feature is
         prohibited. Offerors shall use the ‘Optimize’ Feature of Adobe Acrobat to decrease file size and prepare them for viewing on the
         Internet. Offerors are encouraged to limit file size to 1MB to reduce delay in downloading proposals over the Internet.

      (4)   The Offeror shall prepare a “readme” file, which describes the organization and layout of its softcopy submission.

      (5)   Exceptions to Adobe Acrobat. Proposal documents required to be submitted in other than Adobe Acrobat PDF media are described in
         paragraph (b)(3), above.

d.   Page Numbering.  The offeror shall use a standard page numbering system to facilitate proposal references.  Consecutive page numbering
  within sections is preferred, e.g., Page I-2-5, indicates Part I, Section 2, page 5.  Charts, graphs and other insert materials shall be page-
  numbered as part of the page numbering system. Additional identification of such attachments is permissible.

e.  Past Performance.  The Offeror will be evaluated on performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. The
  Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under
  consideration. The Offeror should consider the factors stated in the Proposal Evaluation Plan as well as the technical task areas identified
  in the SOW.  In order to be considered having acceptable experience/past performance, submit three (3) recent (within the last 3 years) and
  relevant references of efforts similar to size, scope and complexity of the requirements contained in the SOW.  All references shall include
  Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, and Phone Number and email address, if available.  If reference is made to a Government contract, you
  must also include the Agency and Contract Number.  References other than those identified by the Offeror may be contacted by the Government,
  with the information received used in the evaluation of the Offeror's past performance.  An offeror with no past performance information will
  receive a neutral rating, i.e., the rating will not add to or detract from its Past Performance rating

f.   Cost and Pricing Information. No cost or pricing information of any kind shall be included in any part except Part III, Cost/Price
  Proposal.

      (1)  The Cost/Price Proposal Volume shall include prices for all labor categories set forth in the Labor Rate Table in the provided
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Section B).  This table reflects the Government’s required labor categories for all work anticipated under this
contract.  All labor categories must be priced for all of the contract years (5 years total).  Failure to price all labor categories for all
years may result in a rejection of the Offeror’s proposal.  All labor performed under individual task orders will be compensated via the
proposed FFP rates.

          (2)  The Offeror shall provide a separate price proposal for the task order in Section M, in accordance with Section G.1, Task Order
Procedures.    If the task order is determined to have fair and reasonable prices (at the agreed rates), they will be issued immediately
following contract award without further discussions or negotiations.  The Government also reserves the right to hold further discussions or
negotiations after contract award for any task orders that are determined to be technically unacceptable, or with unacceptable pricing, after
contract award.  Task orders are anticipated to be awarded on a Firm Fixed Price basis.

g.   Clarification of Proposals. All changes resulting from clarifications to the proposal will be submitted on a page for page basis. Each page
  changed shall contain a revision date located in a uniform location. Submissions will follow the electronic format.

h.   Freedom of Ambiguity. The information supplied shall be closely aligned with the procurement under consideration and shall be free from
  ambiguities. Ambiguous statements or statements with dual meanings will be interpreted in their most stringent or unfavorable sense.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

M.1. EVALUATION OF OFFERORS
M.1    EVALUATION OF OFFERS                                      (JAN 2007) (DITCO/PL8312).

      a.  The Government intends to conduct a source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiated source selection procedures
contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 15.  The Government anticipates awarding contracts based on initial proposals and does
not plan to conduct discussions.  However, should discussions become necessary, the Government reserves the right to establish a competitive
range, and conduct discussions with those offerors whose proposals fall within the competitive range.

      b.  The Government will evaluate initial proposals in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.212-2-Evaluation-
Commercial Items, below.  Based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the Government will identify the most highly-
rated proposals.

      c.  All elements, subfactors and factors will be measured against standards, which have been developed to represent guidelines for
adequacy of approach and understanding of the requirements.

      d.  Evaluation will include the determination of strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, deficiencies and risks for each element,
subfactor and factor.

      e.  In accordance with FAR 15.306(a), Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or to resolve
minor or clerical errors.

      f.  Any proposal that does not substantially and materially comply with all of the requirements of this solicitation will be rejected and
not considered for further evaluation.  Rejection of a proposal on this basis does not constitute creation of a “competitive range.”

     g.  Once the basic proposal for the ID/IQ is deemed technically acceptable, the Government will, in addition, evaluate only the pricing of
the proposal for the first task order based on the total Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC).




M.2.  BASIS FOR AWARD
M.2  BASIS FOR AWARD                                                (JAN 2007) (DITCO/PL8312).

      a.  The following conditions must be met in order to be eligible for award:

      (1)  The proposal must comply in all material respects with the requirements of the law, regulation and conditions set forth in the
solicitation.

      (2)  The proposal must meet all mandatory solicitation requirements.

      (3) The Offeror must be determined responsible according to the standards of FAR Part 9, Subpart 1.

      b.  There will be one award category:  Full and Open Competition, Set-Aside for Small Businesses.

      c.  The Government anticipates a single award resulting from this solicitation.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal
represents the best value in accordance with the evaluation criteria defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.212-2-Evaluation-
Commercial Items.  The Government reserves the right to award one or no contracts at all, depending on the quality of the proposals received and
the availability of funds.

      d.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s)
represent(s) the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors, subfactors, and elements specified in the solicitation.  The
Government will evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except for clarifications as described in
FAR Subpart 15.3.)  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost and price
standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to set a competitive range and conduct discussions if the contracting officer later determines
them to be necessary.

      e.  The contract award decision will be based on the Government’s evaluation of each offeror’s complete proposal against the evaluation
criteria identified in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.212-2-Evaluation-Commercial Items, below.  Award will be made to that
offeror whose proposal contains the combination of factors offering the best overall value to the Government.  Best value means the expected
outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement (FAR
section 2.101).  In making this evaluation, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and management skills than with
making an award to the offeror with the lowest proposed price.

      f.  When conducting the evaluation, the Government will consider data included by offerors in their proposals, as well as data obtained
from other sources.  While the Government may consider data obtained from other sources, each Offeror is responsible for ensuring that the
information provided is thorough and complete.


                                                                (End of Provision)

 M.3     52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award without
discussions. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of factors offering the best overall value to the Government. Best
value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the
requirement (FAR section 2.101). In making this evaluation, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior Technical/Management
approach ratings than with making an award to the Offeror with the lowest proposed price. There are two non-cost factors: Technical/Management
Approach and Past Performance. Technical/Management Approach is significantly more important than the Past Performance. All Subfactors are
listed in order of importance. All non-cost factors when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.

Attached to this document is the color scheme for rating proposals and a risk assessment table.  The proposal will be evaluated using the
evaluation criteria identified below.  Additionally, the Government will evaluate the contractor’s proposal for risk, to include but not limited
to the areas of technical/management approach, past performance, and all evaluation criteria.  The Government may also evaluate risk with regard
to the contractor’s cost/price proposal.  Proposals which are rated “Red” in any area may be excluded from further consideration.


                       Non-Cost Factors

A.  Technical/Management Approach:  Most Important   Sub-factors are listed in the descending order of importance.



1. Offerors must demonstrate the ability to examine business requirements, assess needs, collect and analyze data to create meaningful
   information to support  strategic planning and improve purchase card program operations.

2. Offerors must demonstrate the technical capability to: (a) support program reporting to include performance measure, GAO, Congressional, and
   OSD inquiry responses; and periodic reporting; (b) develop and update program related processes, policy and guidance internal controls; and
   (c) develop/review legislative language proposals.

3. Offerors must demonstrate the technical capability  to investigate existing and emerging technologies and practices for developing
   capabilities/tools that can be used for the management, maintenance and control of charge card or financial programs.


B.  Past Performance:  Important   Sub-factors are listed in the descending order of importance.

1. Offerors must demonstrate a working-level knowledge of the policy, guidance, management, and operation (including the Smart Pay business
   arrangements) of DOD charge card programs to include knowledge of existing policy documentation, program metrics, and rebate calculations.

2. Offerors must demonstrate the ability to retain personnel to ensure seamless analytical, technical and program support throughout contract
   performance.

3. Offerors must demonstrate performance as the lead contractor or a significant sub-contractor on one or more technical, analytical and/or
   program support contract(s) directly related to a Federal Government Charge Card Program in the past five years.



Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

                                                                   Cost Factor

   1. Price proposals will be evaluated for price reasonableness and completeness.
   2. All non-cost evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than the cost factor.
   3. FACTOR 3 – COST AND PRICING.

            (1) The offeror is required to submit all pricing data in the format indicated in Sections B and L of the solicitation.  Offerors
are required to submit their proposed prices for the entire 60-month period, as set forth in Section B of the solicitation.  The evaluation
period commences with the date of contract award and ends 60 months later.  Contract months and evaluation months are assumed to be the same.

                 (2) The proposed prices for the labor categories and the task order will be evaluated with respect to their completeness and
reasonableness.  Offerors shall submit prices for the complete set of requirements.  The reasonableness of the overall price will be determined
on the basis of adequate price competition and by comparison with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).

            (3) The Government may evaluate cost and price realism with regard to the ability of the offeror to meet requirements in terms of
skills required, complexity of disciplines and job difficulty, if the Government deems such analysis necessary.  The Offeror’s Cost/Price
Proposal may be compared to the technical proposals to determine the offeror’s (1) understanding of work to be performed and (2) capability and
capacity to provide the required services and accomplish the required tasks.  The Government may also assess the labor support information
submitted with Volume III - Cost and Price proposal, as part of any cost realism analysis conducted.  Unrealistically low prices may indicate a
lack of complete understanding of the requirements, a high-risk approach to performance, and or an inability to attract and maintain a high-
quality workforce.  The Government considers the findings of such analysis regarding an offeror’s ability to perform and the risk of its
approach.  Since proposed labor rates are fixed, the price evaluation shall not be adjusted as a result of any such cost realism analysis.

                 (4) The price evaluation for all Offerors will be based on the total Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) for each proposal.  The
DLCC will be determined based on the proposed rates for the labor categories, along with the proposed prices of the first task order.
Contractor-generated labor categories will not be included as part of the DLCC evaluation.  The proposed labor rates for each labor category in
Section B, for each respective year, will be multiplied by the corresponding hours specified by the Government.   In order to obtain maximum
price competition, the number of hours for each labor category to be used for the price evaluation will not be disclosed outside the Government.
 The Government will compute an annual price by totaling the labor costs and the evaluated task order prices.  Discount factors will then be
applied to the total annual price.  The price evaluation will use the discount factors indicated below based upon the nominal discount rate of
3.3 percent specified in OMB Circular A-94:


|Evaluation Year (EY)       |1                 |2                     |3                   |4                  |5                      |

2.  Task Order Title.

      DoD UID/PC PMO Charge and Payment Card Analytical, Technical and Program Support Services

3.  Background.

   A) The DoD UID/PC PMO is responsible for leading and managing the DoD PC program.  In carrying out its mission, the DoD UID/PC PMO:

         • Identifies program requirements
         • Develops and deploys new electronic systems and other management tools
         • Ensures seamless integration of new and existing electronic systems
         • Develops and disseminates DoD-wide policies
         • Tracks and reports performance measures
         • Responds to Congressional inquiries and other program findings
         • Manages DoD’s relationship with purchase card issuing banks
         • Improves program operation and appropriately expands charge and payment card use
         • Coordinates with other charge card program offices and authorized program representatives DoD-wide to implement and integrate
           systems, streamline policy and guidance, and unify practices where appropriate

   B) This effort is required to provide specific technical expertise that is currently unavailable within the Government.  This requirement is
      currently being met for the UID/PC PMO under T&M Contract W91QV1-04-C-0011 which was awarded to Logistics Management Institute on 9 Sep
      2004.  Additionally, purchase order N00189-07-P-Z049 was awarded to Alpha Scientific Laboratories, Inc. on 13 Nov 2006 to meet specialized
      short term technical support requirements.  Several of the Defense Components have contractual vehicles in place for these type of support
      services.  This will not be a Requirements Contract.

   C) The work required under this contract will, at times, build directly upon work performed under the on-going contract (e.g., annual
      guidebook updates).  However, other efforts will be “new starts”, except they may draw upon analyses and studies previously performed and
      delivered to the Government; any such materials will be made available to the contractor as required for task completion.

4.  Objectives.

      This effort is required to provide specific technical expertise related to charge and payment cards that is currently unavailable within
      the Government.  The objective is to receive reliable, timely, actionable analytical, technical and program support to allow the DoD UID/PC
      PMO to accomplish its mission.

5.   Scope.

      The DoD UID/PC PMO requires an IDIQ/Task Order be awarded for Charge and Payment Card Analytical, Technical and Program Support Services.
      The contractor shall use their experience and expertise with DoD, its electronic acquisition and financial management systems, and
      management and operation of charge card programs in the unique circumstances DoD operates (e.g., in theater and at sea) to provide
      analytical, technical and program support, perform studies and analyses, make recommendations and develop draft documents related to charge
      and payment cards.

6.  Specific Tasks.

      CLIN 0001 - In accordance with IDIQ Tasks 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 on the basic ID/IQ contract, the contractor shall provide analytical
      support to the Department of Defense (DoD) Unit Identification (UID) / Purchase Card (PC) Program Management Office (PMO).  Acceptance of
      deliverables will be made NLT 30 days after delivery.


      PMO priorities fluctuate over time due to changes in leadership (e.g., a new administration), the environment (e.g., 9/11, Hurricane
      Katrina, budget cuts) and information (e.g., study and analysis results and audit findings).  In order to successfully respond to these
      fluctuations, the PMO regularly reprioritizes efforts or refocuses tasks to ensure both the PMO’s and the DoD community it supports’
      mission requirement are met.  At this time, the tasks assigned the highest priority by the PMO include:

         • Effective and Efficient Program Operation
         • Purchase Card On-Line System  Development and Deployment (Contact the Contracting Officer for PCOLS ConOps)
             o Data Mining (DM) Development and Deployment
             o Authorization, Issuance and Maintenance (AIM) Development and Deployment
         • 3in1 Requirements Specification, Development and Deployment (Contact the Contracting Officer for 3in1 Overview Brief)
         • Increased integration with existing DoD acquisition and financial systems (e.g., PCOLS, DoD e-Mall and Wide Area Workflow)
