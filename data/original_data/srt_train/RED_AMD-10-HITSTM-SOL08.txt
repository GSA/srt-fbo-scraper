HEALTH IT STANDARDS AND TEST METHODS – ANALYSIS OF HEALTH IT STANDARDS INCLUDING ANALYSIS OF A STANDARD’S SUITABILITY, GAPS, ERRORS,
TESTABILITY, COMPATIBILITY, IMPLEMENTABILITY, AND SPECIFICITY FOR HL7 QUALITY REPORTING DATA ARCHITECTURE (QRDA)


BACKGROUND

The Health IT Standards Analysis Project supports the broader NIST Healthcare IT Testing Infrastructure Project.

The objective of the Health IT Standards Analysis Project is to focus resources on specific, national priority standards needs in the healthcare
community to further clinical information exchange among providers, consumers, public health and other stakeholders.  This project does not seek
to select the standards that should be used by the healthcare community; it seeks to analyze those standards deemed appropriate by the
healthcare community by objectively determining the maturity, robustness, testability and suitability of a particular standard for use (i.e., is
it free from ambiguities, errors, inconsistencies, omissions, and to the extent possible, meet intended requirements).  Additionally this
project seeks to develop appropriate test material, data and standard-specific test tools for high priority national need standards for
interoperability.

The following items are out of scope and are not considered part of the HIT Testing Analysis Project:

Developing standards – NIST will not create standards, but will provide expert analysis resources and the tools needed to test existing
standards and/or specifications

Performing certifications – NIST will not perform product certification, but will provide the tools that can be used by testing organizations.

Conducting operational testing – NIST will not conduct any type of operational or functional testing, but will provide the tools that can be
leveraged by the stakeholder organizations to integrate into their testing processes

SCOPE

The objective of this contract is to support NIST in helping to ensure that Health Level Seven Quality Reporting Data Architecture (QRDA) meets
the current and projected needs in support of the concept of ARRA meaningful use.  In support of this contract, the Contractor shall provide a
suitability analysis, and standards action plan for meeting suitability needs identified.

CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS

The Contractor shall have expertise in HL 7 QRDA and general principles that support the development of error-free, consistent, testable and
implementable standards. Expertise could be demonstrated by having made contributions that furthered health IT standards specifications and
testing  including contributions to health IT consensus-based activities that furthered health IT interoperability (e.g., proposed normative
standard/specification language/document, proposed specifications, proposed testing approaches, development of test data sets,
authorship/editor, conveyor, chair, etc.) (A listing of attendance at health IT standards-related activities is not sufficient.)

SPECIFIC TASKS

   1. Task Management – After award, the Contractor shall attend a Start-of-Work Meeting with the COTR and other designated representatives
      either at the Government’s facility or via web/teleconference within seven days after notice to proceed.  As a result of this meeting, the
      Contractor shall produce a Work Plan with milestones and timelines sufficient to meet contract requirements.  This work plan shall be
      submitted to the COTR by electronic mail within seven working days of the start-of-work meeting.

   2. Coverage Analysis – The Contractor shall provide a coverage analysis detailing each aspect of the standard.  The Contractor shall propose
      which aspects of the standard need to be included in the test data and which can be excluded in order to reduce the impact of test data
      development and testing.  The Contractor shall deliver a draft coverage analysis within 30 days of the final work plan and schedule a
      meeting to discuss the analysis with NIST.  The final coverage analysis shall be delivered within 15 days of receipt of written comments
      from the COTR.

   3. Test Data – the Contractor shall deliver a test data set in three formats:  1) in a Microsoft 2003 Excel spreadsheet and 2-3) HL7 v2 (2.3.1
      and 2.5.1) clinical lab test result definition formats.  The Contractor shall provide an analysis demonstrating traceability of the data to
      the coverage analysis.  The test data shall contain demographic data and clinical lab result data for a minimum of 50 fictitious subjects.
      The Contractor shall deliver draft test data within 60 days of the final coverage analysis and schedule a meeting to discuss the test data
      with NIST.  The final test data shall be delivered within 30 days of receipt of written comments from the COTR.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT

 1. The Contractor shall maintain and update the work plan as required. The Contractor shall measure, on a periodic basis, Contractor progress
    against the project plan.


 2. The Contractor shall participate in monthly project status meeting via web/teleconference to discuss task progress, issues and coordination
    with other NIST activities.

 3. The Contractor shall attend meetings at NIST or other locations as needed.

 4. The Contractor shall furnish all management, labor, tools, supplies, and material (except as provided by the Government as indicated herein)
    necessary to perform the requirements contained herein.

   The Contractor shall present themselves as an independent Contractor at all meetings and activities and shall not state that they represent
   NIST.  This includes representation through email correspondence, name badges, attendance rosters, meeting/conference registration, etc.

                    (End of clause)

2.  52.204-7  CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)

  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
  "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct
of business with the Government.
  "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique
business entities.
  "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a
business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the
business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at
Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
  "Registered in the CCR database" means that--
    (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and
    (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the
Government as a part of the CCR registration process.
  (b)
    (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database
prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing
agreement resulting from this solicitation.
    (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4"
followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be
used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.
  (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
    (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--
      (i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-
866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
      (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.  The offeror should indicate that it is an
offeror the a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
    (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:
      (i) Company legal business.
      (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.
      (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.
      (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).
      (v) Company Telephone Number.
      (vi) Date the company was started.
      (vii) Number of employees at your location.
      (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.
      (ix) Line of business (industry).
      (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).
  (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer
will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.
  (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered
should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.
  (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from
the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the
Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in
the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this
contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
  (g)
    (1)
      (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's
written notification of its intention to
        (A) change the name in the CCR database;
        (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
        (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with
the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
  (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
  "Contract" as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services
(including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of
appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are
not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such
as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications.
Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see
FAR Part 16.
  "First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the
Recovery Act.
  "Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a
result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions
established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent"
(FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor.
For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.
  "Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States
and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all
hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a fulltime schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees
and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter.
  "Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following
(for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)):
    (1) Salary and bonus.
    (2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting
purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R),
Shared Based Payments.
    (3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement
plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees.
    (4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans.
    (5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified.
    (6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or
property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000.
  (b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 (Recovery Act).  Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this
contract. These reports will be made available to the public.
  (c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to
June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each
calendar quarter.
  (d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov.
    (1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable.

portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act.
    (7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each
calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide--
      (i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR

the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and
      (ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job

    (9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor
that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier
subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount.

under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the

          (2) Subcontractors; and/or


          (3) Divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the offeror under a common control;


      The Offeror must establish fixed hourly rates using--


          (1) Separate rates for each category of labor to be performed by each subcontractor and for each category of labor to be performed by
      the Offeror, and for each category of labor to be transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the offeror under a common
      control;


          (2) Blended rates for each category of labor to be performed by the Offeror, including labor transferred between divisions,

      per labor category, and a ceiling labor-hour cost based on those labor categories, hours and fully loaded rates for performance of all

      more labor categories will be required to complete the requirements of this acquisition.  This number of labor-hours may be distributed, if
      appropriate, across more than one labor category.  The Offeror should use 850 total hours for quotation preparation purposes.


      The cost/price section of the quotation shall also include a detailed breakdown of travel requirements, if any, proposed by the Offeror.
      Such breakdown should include specific trips, number of days per trip, as well as cost for hotels, lodging, meals and incidental expenses.
      Travel costs should be based on Chapter 301 of the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) and would be reimbursed accordingly.  For current GSA-
      approved per-diem rates and personally operated vehicle (POV) rates that should be used to estimate travel costs, go to www.gsa.gov, and
      then click on “Per Diem Rates” and “POV Mileage Reimbursement” on the top left side of that page.  Airfare would be reimbursed as coach
      class airfare.  The Government will allow application of General and Administrative (G&A) burden to proposed travel costs (if any), but
      will not authorize payment of profit on travel costs.  Therefore, the Offeror shall not include profit for proposed travel costs.


      As indicated in the presolicitation notice, NIST is soliciting this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition
      Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to but not exceeding $100,000, including
      travel costs, if any).


      The Offeror shall submit its quotation by email so that it is received at frank.yonce@nist.gov and joseph.widdup@nist.gov no later than
      April 02, 2010 at no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.


      The cost/price portion of the quotation should be a submitted as a separate file from the rest of the quotation and should be readable by
      Microsoft Office Excel 2003.


Evaluations Factors for Award:


      NIST intends to award one or more purchase orders to the responsible small business Offeror(s) whose quotation is deemed to represent the
      best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered.  Evaluation factors include:


   a. Technical Approach and Understanding of Requirements


      The Government will determine the soundness and feasibility of the Offeror’s approach to performing SOW requirements, as well as the depth
      of the Offeror’s demonstrated understanding of SOW requirements.

   b. Resumes of Proposed Personnel

      The Government will evaluate each resume submitted in the quotation to determine the extent to which the proposed personnel are qualified
      to perform the requirements of the SOW, including but not limited to the “CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS” section, based on their demonstrated
      education and experience.  Only text that is included in the resume will be evaluated.


   c. Past Performance Information

      The Government will evaluate the quality and relevance of past performance information for the Offeror in performing contracts that are
      similar to the scope of this acquisition that were completed within the past three (3) years or are currently being performed.  The
      Government may utilize references provided by the Offeror and any other references or sources of information for this purposes.  In the
      event that the Offeror does not have relevant past performance information, the Offeror would receive a neutral rating for this factor.

   d. Evaluated Cost/Price

      The Government will derive the evaluated cost/price by totaling the labor costs as proposed in the quotation and adding proposed travel
      costs to it.  If appropriate, the Government will also perform a cost realism analysis and may adjust proposed costs for evaluation
      purposes if they are deemed to be unrealistic.


      If cost realism analysis is performed, the evaluated cost/price after cost realism analysis is performed will be used for evaluation and
      source selection purposes.


Non-cost/price factors a through c are approximately equal in importance.  Non-cost factors a through c, when combined, are approximately
equally important to factor d (evaluated cost/price).

  (c) Remedies - The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination
necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior

Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor for Government contracting, or pursue such
other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
  (d) The Contractor further agrees to insert provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this
paragraph (d), in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder.
                    (End of clause)

final rates are established. These billing rates--

payment date, whichever is earlier; and

its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause.
  (d) Release and use restrictions. Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this contract, the Contractor shall not use, release,
reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced in the performance of this contract, nor authorize others to do so, without written

16.  52.232-7  PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS (FEB 2007)

  The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized
representative:
  (a) Hourly rate.
    (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor
category specified in the contract that are--
      (i) Performed by the Contractor;
      (ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or
      (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control.
    (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor hours
performed.
    (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.
Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is
performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.
    (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall
be payable on a prorated basis.
    (5) Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting
Officer or authorized representative. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly
rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by--
      (i) Individual daily job timekeeping records;
      (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or
      (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject
to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative.
    (7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the
Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to
protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this
clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor
executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (f) of this clause.
    (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the
Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to
the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.
  (b) Materials.
    (1) or the purposes of this clause--
      (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.
      (ii) Materials means--
        (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common
control;
        (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract;
        (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer
usage charges, etc.); and
        (D) Applicable indirect costs.
    (2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such
materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--
      (i) Quantities being acquired; and
      (ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.
    (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials
provided the Contractor--
      (i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or
      (ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such
payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.
    (4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine
allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract.
    (5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are--
      (i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate;
      (ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and
      (iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates.
    (6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--
      (i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and
      (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take
advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit
to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the
Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the
benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government.
    (7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials.
  (c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such
consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the
Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at
the sole discretion of the Government.
  (d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price
set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations
under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material
costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued,
will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of
the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this
contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater
or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price
for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has
reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price,
the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the
contract.
  (e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and
the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and
until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised
ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in
the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the
increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling
price.
  (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting
documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the
Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the "completion voucher" and supporting
documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents
and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and
supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract,
but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.
  (g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at
the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under
this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:
    (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.
    (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives
notice in writing to the Contractin g Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
    (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.
  (h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services.
    (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are not
subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.
    (2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 30th  day after the designated  billing office
receives a proper payment request. In the event that the  Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request  to ensure
compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the  designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the  specified due
date.
  (i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will
make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
          (End of Clause)

17.  1352.233-70  HARMLESS FROM LIABILITY (MAR 2000)

  The Contractor shall hold and save the Government, its officers, agents, and employees harmless from liability of any nature or kind,
including costs and expenses to which they may be subject to or on account of any or all suits or damages of any character whatsoever resulting
from injuries or damages sustained by any person or persons or property by virtue of performance of this contract, arising or resulting in whole
or in part from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the contractor, or any subcontractor, their employees, and agents.
                    (End of clause)

18.  52.243-3  CHANGES--TIME-AND-MATERIALS OR LABOR-HOURS (SEP 2000)

  (a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general
scope of this contract in any one or more of the following:
    (1) Description of services to be performed.
    (2) Time of performance (i.e., hours of the day, days of the week, etc.).
    (3) Place of performance of the services.
    (4) Drawings, designs, or specifications when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government in accordance
with the drawings, designs, or specifications.
    (5) Method of shipment or packing of supplies.
    (6) Place of delivery.
    (7) Amount of Government-furnished property.
  (b) If any change causes an increase or decrease in any hourly rate, the ceiling price, or the time required for performance of any part of
the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, or otherwise affects any other terms and conditions of this contract, the
Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in any one or more of the following and will modify the contract accordingly:
    (1) Ceiling price.
    (2) Hourly rates.
    (3) Delivery schedule.
    (4) Other affected terms.
  (c) The Contractor shall assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order.
However, if the Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted
before final payment of the contract.
  (d) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause excuses the Contractor
from proceeding with the contract as changed.
          (End of Clause)

19.  52.246-6  INSPECTION--TIME-AND-MATERIAL AND LABOR-HOUR (MAR 2001)

  (a) "Definitions." As used in this clause--
  "Contractor's managerial personnel" means any of the Contractor's directors, officers, managers, superintendents, or equivalent
representatives who have supervision or direction of--
    (1) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business;
    (2) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at any one plant or separate location where the contract is being performed; or
    (3) A separate and complete major industrial operation connected with the performance of this contract.
  "Materials" includes data when the contract does not include the Warranty of Data clause.
  (b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the material, fabricating methods,
work, and services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made
available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires.
  (c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent
practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect
the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests
in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
  (d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall
require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
  (e) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as
promptly as practicable after delivery, and they shall be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
  (f) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after
acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct
services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (h) of this
clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under the Payments Under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts clause,
but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate
attributable to profit. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without
disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.

correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may--

cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or
      (ii) Terminate this contract for default.
    (2) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute.
  (h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) of this clause, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or
replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is
due to--
    (1) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or
    (2) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial
personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.
  (i) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and
services originally delivered under this contract.
  (j) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do
not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.
  (k) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be
governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.
          (End of Clause)
