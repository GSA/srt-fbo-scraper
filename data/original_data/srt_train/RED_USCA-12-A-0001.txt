DATE (JAN 2003)

M.2.1 Evaluation of Proposals M.2.1.1 General 1. This procurement is being conducted using formal source selection procedures, and contract award(s) shall be made to the Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) conforms to the solicitation, and are determined to be most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the requirements stated below. The evaluation shall be conducted using the evaluation criteria as set forth in this Section. Each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. Proposal clarification/revision requests may be issued which encompass any and all written documentation submitted in response to the RFP as may be deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to fully explore and evaluate the merits of proposals submitted.

M.2.1.2 Evaluation Approach Each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation shall be evaluated for technical excellence and price reasonableness. M.2.1.2.1 Technical Excellence Evaluation The Technical Excellence Factors shall be evaluated based upon the information contained in the Page 48 of 50

COMMUNITY SUPERVISION MONITORING SERVICES

USCA-12-A-0001

Offeror's proposal, as well as any other outside information available to the Government that pertains to the Technical Excellence Factors. The ultimate objective of the evaluation is to determine which proposal offers the best technical value to the government. Although price/cost is considered secondary to technical capabilities, it shall be a significant criterion for award as part of an integrated assessment with the Technical Excellence Section. The proposals shall be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth below: Technical Excellence Factors A. Monitoring Equipment and Services (L.7.2.1) B. Past Experience (L.7.2.2) C. Past Performance (L.7.2.2) With respect to the evaluation of Technical Excellence, Factor A is more important than Factors B and C. Factors B and C are of equal importance, but less important than Factor A. For each factor, the evaluation shall consist of an assessment of the degree to which the services offered in the proposal provide added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk. Additionally, the evaluation shall identify the strengths, weaknesses, and risks in each Offeror's proposal with respect to each evaluation factor. M.2.1.2.2 Price Evaluation The offeror's proposed pricing shall be evaluated for reasonableness. Offers that are unrealistically high or low in price shall be considered indicative of a lack of understanding of the complexity and risk associated with work performed under the resulting contract. Offers that contain unrealistic prices shall not be considered for award. M.2.1.2.3 Operational Capability Demonstration (OCD) The Government reserves the right to conduct an Operational Capability Demonstration (OCD) for any offeror considered for award. This demonstration shall show that the accessories, equipment, supplies and monitoring services proposed can meet the requirements described in Section C. The OCD shall not require a "hands-on" evaluation by Government representatives. The Offeror must perform the OCD using identical accessories, equipment and supplies to that proposed. The OCD shall be conducted at the Offeror's site and a probation office in the area of the Offeror's site. Failure of an apparent awardee to adequately demonstrate a requirement during the OCD may result in elimination from consideration for award. M.3 CONTRACT AWARD

The Government intends to award one or more contracts resulting from this solicitation. Contract award(s) shall be made to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer represents the best Page 49 of 50

COMMUNITY SUPERVISION MONITORING SERVICES

USCA-12-A-0001

overall value to the Government, given the outcome of the Government's evaluation of each offeror's technical proposal and price. In selecting the best overall value, the Government shall consider the quality offered for the evaluated price. The relative quality of offers shall be based upon the Government's assessment of whether the technical excellence offered in the proposal provides added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk. The Government may make tradeoffs in all or some of the evaluated areas and determine that a proposal offers the best overall value to the Government. M.4 DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY (JAN 2003) Guide 3-70

A determination of responsibility shall be made on the apparent successful offeror(s) prior to contract award. If the prospective contractor(s) is/are found non-responsible, that offeror shall be rejected and shall receive no further consideration for award. In the event a contractor is rejected based on a determination of non-responsibility, a determination shall be made on the next apparent successful offeror. [ END OF SECTION M ]
