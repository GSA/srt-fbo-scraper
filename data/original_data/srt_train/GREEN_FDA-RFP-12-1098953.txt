                 (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered
                 by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the
                 restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end
                 products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such
                 products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-
           (1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by
           any Federal agency;
           (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
           against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a
           Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the
           submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false
           statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
           (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
           of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
           (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
           amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
                 (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
                       (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is
                       not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to
                       the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
                       (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax
                       liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action
                       is precluded.
                 (ii) Examples.
                       (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek
                       Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.
                       Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all
                       judicial appear rights.
                       (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been
                       issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting
                       the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of
                       the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior
                       opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the
                       taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
                       appeal rights.
                       (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely
                       payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not
                       currently required to make full payment.
                       (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is
                       stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

|                                                              |                                                              |


           (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this
           provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]
                 [_] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or
                 manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.

                 manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that is has made a good faith effort
                 to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished
                 under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly—
           (1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States
           exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
           (2) [_] Outside the United States.
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with
respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]
           (1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does
           not certify that—
                 (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are
                 sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general
                 public in the course of normal business operations;
                 (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
                 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
                 (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the
                 same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
           (2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that—
                 (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the
                 offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of
                 normal business operations;
                 (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR
                 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
                 (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time
                 (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available
                 hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
                 (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same
                 as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
           (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
                 (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a
                 Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as
                 possible; and
                 (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph
                 (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this

14    EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS

 14.1  52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)


 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
 will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors are listed in descending order of
 importance and shall be used to evaluate offers:


   Factor 1 - Technical Approach
   Factor 2 -Organizational Experience
   Factor 3- Past Performance
   Factor 4- Price


 Technical factors, when combined, are significantly more importance when compared to price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award
 to other than the lowest priced offeror.  Technical factors shall be evaluated qualitatively and categorized as Excellent, Very Good,
 Acceptable, Marginal, and Unacceptable in relation to the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.
 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
 requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
 shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
 specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
 the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
 withdrawal is received before award.


                                                                (End of provision)


 14.2  Factor 1 - Technical Approach


 The government shall evaluate the Offeror’s proposal in terms of the responsiveness to the objectives described in the SOW and in terms of its
 suitability for prescription-medical claim and patient-level research.  This includes but is not limited to the depth, breath, and availability
 of individual data elements, overall size and representativeness of the data resource, the transparency and scientific soundness of the
 Offeror’s data collection, processing, sampling and projection methodology, data flow and management procedures for prescription-medical claim
 and patient-level data and Section 508 compliance.
 Trial Subscription Review: FDA researchers shall use the tool for the duration of the technical evaluation review to conduct drug-, condition-
 or demographic-specific queries.  The product shall be evaluated in terms of transparency, flexibility, ability to accommodate multiple users,
 consistency in results, completeness, efficiency and ease of use. At a minimum, the FDA will review the ability to access prescription-medical
 claim and patient level data ,the ability to select drug products by active ingredient, generic and brand name, to stratify by patient and
 physician demographics, the ability to archive queries and results, the ability to retrieve same (dated) information over time, and the
 timeliness of data retrieval.






 14.3  Factor 2 - Organizational Experience


 The proposal shall demonstrate the relevance of organizational experience and qualifications with prescription-medical claim and patient level
 data; their experience in the development, management, and operation of information systems/databases at high quality and reliable levels.
 Highly relevant organizational experiences will be more highly rated.

 14.4  Factor 3- Past Performance

The Government will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor.

The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood
of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a
list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition
requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's
record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance;
the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-
like concern for the interest of the customer.

If the performance information contains negative information on which the offeror has not previously been given an opportunity to comment, FDA
will provide the offeror an opportunity to comment on it priori to its consideration in the evaluation, and any offeror comment will be
considered with the negative performance information.

The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends
in the offeror's performance.

The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor
disadvantage of the offeror.

 14.5  Factor 4- Price Evaluation



 The Government will evaluate the Contractor’s ability to deliver efficient, low-risk performance at a fair and reasonable price.

The FDA’s evaluation of price realism will consider the extent to which proposed pricing indicates a clear understanding of solicitation
requirements, reflects a sound approach to satisfying those requirements, and is consistent with the approach described in the offeror’s
technical volume. The price realism assessment will consider technical and management risks identified during evaluation of the quote.
Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis
that the offeror either doesn’t understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.

1. Project Title: “Access to Data on Pharmaceutical Sales”



2.  Background


A vital part of FDA and CDER’s mission is to promote and protect the public health.  The mission of the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology
(OSE) is to evaluate drug risks and promote the safe use of drugs by the American people.  The mission of the Drug Shortage Program (DSP) is to
minimize the impact of shortages of drug products, by working to avoid such shortages or to mitigate the effects when shortage is unavoidable.
The mission of the Office of the Commissioner (OC) is to implement the Agency’s responsibilities associated with economic and quantitative
analysis of regulatory policies and other health policy issues.

To fulfill these missions and other program functions, CDER requires access to national-level pharmaceutical sales data and, as needed,
international data to estimate and forecast trends in pharmaceutical sales, pricing and volume of distribution throughout various settings of
care.

 Continued access to these data allows the FDA to respond expeditiously to questions relating to drug safety, the impact of regulatory policies
and to potential drug shortage situations as well as strengthen the FDA’s position in the following critical areas.

The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA,
Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to
ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products.  In early 2005, FDA commissioned the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct
a study to examine the US drug safety system.  In September 2006, the Institute of Medicine Report entitled, “The Future of Drug Safety:
Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public” was released and outlined numerous ongoing and future activities designed to continue to
strengthen the FDA’s drug safety program.  Specific recommendations in the IOM report addressed modernizing the drug safety program and outlined
activities designed to modernize the process of pharmacovigilance, including activities for the expansion of database resources.

In addition, Title IX of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA 2007) contains numerous provisions related to post-
marketing safety and communication of safety information.  A subset of those provisions calls for enhanced authorities for post-marketing
studies, expanded pharmacovigilance, and active surveillance activities.  These include the authority to develop methods to obtain access to
disparate data sources, establish and improve procedures to identify data trends and patterns for pharmacovigilance and active surveillance
activities, and improve transparency of information about drugs by providing access to summaries of data collected by pharmacovigilance systems.
 In furtherance of these efforts and in conjunction with CDER’s missions, FDA seeks to continue access to national-level drug utilization data.

FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the
data.

FDA's authority to fund research projects is set out in section 301 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA 42 U.S.C. 241).


 3. Objectives

                                                APPENDIX E - Data Disclosure Clearance Procedures




PURPOSE:

As provided for at FAR 52.227-14 (Alt II), [Name of Contractor] (“Contractor”) has provided a Limited Rights Notice to FDA (Appendix D)
identifying Limited Rights Data (see definition below). This Limited Rights Notice authorizes FDA to disclose these Limited Rights Data for
public health, safety, and regulatory purposes, provided that the disclosures of these data are made subject to prohibition against their
further disclosure.

In accordance with the Limited Rights Notice, the purpose of this document is to establish timely clearance procedures for the FDA and
Contractor to follow when FDA seeks either (1) to make Aggregated Limited Rights Data (see definition below) publicly available, or (2) to
disclose actual Limited Rights Data to specific third parties subject to prohibition against their further disclosure.

DEFINITIONS:

Aggregated Limited Rights Data -- Any collective or summary presentation of Limited Rights Data that does not disclose any raw data accessed by
FDA from [Name of Contractor] (Contractor) [Database System].

De-identified Data – Data that have had patient, hospital, and physician information removed, e.g., names, addresses, social security numbers,
and dates of birth, so that any user or audience cannot purposefully or inadvertently discover a patient’s identity.

Limited Rights Data – For purposes of these data disclosure clearance procedures, the definition of Limited Rights Data provided at FAR 52.227-
14 is understood to include raw data, accessed by FDA personnel through the [Database Systems].

Public Release – Any communications, meetings, or interactions where FDA personnel make information publicly available, including by disclosing
it: to any private, public, or governmental entity other than in accordance with paragraph 5 of these procedures; at any public event, such as
the public portion of an advisory committee meeting or a public presentation or demonstration; through any publication in any media, such as
scientific and technical articles; or in any agency record that FDA makes available on a non-confidential basis to anyone outside FDA, including
in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.


PROCEDURES:

 These clearance procedures do not apply to disclosure of information, including of Limited Rights Data and/or Aggregated Limited Rights Data,
made in response to an authorized request of Congress or any other government body of competent jurisdiction (see [section of primary agreement
in which such disclosures are discussed]  [Database System]  (“Agreement”).

1. FDA and Contractor shall complete the Clearance Procedure Cover Sheet (Attachment 2 is a blank copy) upon execution of the Agreement.  This
   form provides the names and contact information for individuals who shall serve as the primary contact (Contact) for each party.  Each party
   must update the Cover Sheet any time any of its contact information or its Contact changes.

2. For each proposed disclosure, FDA shall submit a Clearance Request Form (Attachment 2 is a blank copy), a copy of the materials to be
   disclosed, and a copy of the source data files cited in those materials.

3. FDA shall identify Contractor as the data source when disclosing Aggregated Limited Rights Data or Limited Rights Data.


4. Within 24 hours of receipt by the Contractor's Contact of the Clearance Request Form, Contractor shall provide a clearance decision for the
   requested Public Release of Aggregated Limited Rights Data.

5. Disclosure approval applies to the life of the materials as approved.  FDA shall notify the contractor of further release, at the
   contractor’s request.

6. Within 48 hours of receipt by the Contractor's Contact of the Clearance Request Form, the Contractor shall provide a clearance decision for
   disclosure of Limited Rights Data to a third party in accordance with the following conditions:

     a. The third party must be actively engaged in a project initiated by FDA;
     b. Clearance to share the data with the third party shall be granted only for purposes of the FDA initiated project and shall not extend
        beyond the duration of the third party's active engagement in that project;
     c. The third party must execute in a timely manner the required Contractor Third Party Access agreement and agree in writing to return any
        copies of the data provided to, or made by, that party when the third party is no longer actively engaged in such project or at such
        earlier time as FDA may request in writing; and
     d. The third party must agree in writing not to release the Limited Rights Data to any additional party.

7. If a third party that received Limited Rights Data in accordance with paragraph 5 seeks to disclose materials that include Aggregated Limited
   Rights Data, the third party must submit an electronic copy of those materials and of the source data files relied upon to FDA for submission
   to Contractor for clearance approval.

8. Clearance to use Limited Rights Data and/or Aggregated Limited Rights Data does not grant any third party rights to use the (Name of
   Contractor) (Contractor) [Database Systems] software tools.


TERM:

This policy shall be in effect for the calendar year for the length of the contract and thereafter until either party notifies the other of its
termination or Contractor provides to the FDA a different policy.

                                        Note on obtaining copies of proprietary software from contractors

If FDA may wish to receive from a data provider copies of associated proprietary software that was not developed with FDA funds:*

   (1) In addition to cross-referencing FAR 52.227-14, the data access agreement should--

        a. cross-reference FAR 52.227-14 Alt. III (1987) regarding access to "restricted computer software"; and


        b. include the following statement, explaining that such software constitutes "restricted computer software" for purposes of the
           agreement:

           Restricted Computer Software -- For purposes of [Agreement], the definition of Restricted Computer Software provided at FAR 52.227-14
           is understood to include any proprietary computer software the development of which FDA did not fund.

   (2) The Contractor should provide a Restricted Rights Notice to FDA with the software as provided for at FAR 52.227-14 Alt. III (1987). The
      content of the notice can be specified in the agreement. Contact legal counsel if the parties wish to use language in the notice that is
      different from the model language provided at FAR 52.227-14 Alt. III (1987).


      *If FDA paid for development of the software, the software would not be "restricted computer software" and these special provisions and
      procedures would not apply.



                                                                    APPENDIX G
 Exchanging Certificates with the External Individual and FDA Secure Electronic Mail System


1. The external user must obtain his or her own certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) like Digital Signature Trust Co., Thawte
   Consulting, (Pty) Ltd., or VeriSign, Inc.  (Instructions on how to obtain certificates are located at the end of this document.)


2. After he or she has obtained a commercial grade U.S. Domestic 1024-bit key certificate, the user will need to send a signed message to the
   address cert-query@fda.hhs.gov.  The message must have a subject of Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov.  The body of the E-mail may be blank because
   the certificate exchange process ignores it.


   By digitally signing this message, the user is providing his or her certificate to the Tumbleweed E-mail Firewall (EMF) system.  The address
   in the “To” field directs the message to an auto-responder built into the Tumbleweed EMF system.  EMF responds to the cert-query@fda.hhs.gov
   by returning the proxy certificate of the person specified in the “Subject” field, according to the alias name or username. Initially all
   secure testing is completed with Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov. However, all external users will need to complete these same steps with each
   person they need to correspond with at FDA to enable secure e-mail communications. Please make sure that you use the
   firstname.lastname@fda.hhs.gov ONLY.


A. The external user should simply double-click on Tumbleweed EMF’s certificate.  This will open the “Certificate” window.  Click on the
   “Details” tab to view this certificate’s details.


B. Click the “Install Certificate...” button at the bottom of this window’s “General” tab.  This will begin the Certificate Manager Import
   Window.  Click the “Next” button to continue.


C. Choose to “Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate” when prompted.


D. Click the “Finish” button to complete the wizard.  A warning will appear, asking if you want to add the certificate to the root store.  Click
   “Yes” to add it.  A message saying that the certificate has been added should appear.  Close the “Certificate” window by clicking “OK.”


1. By this time, the external user should have gotten a response to his or her certificate query.  The query response should appear to have come
   from the user that was queried.  In Outlook, a reddish ribbon and a blue lock will appear on the e-mail message showing that the message has
   been digitally signed and contains the sender’s certificate.  The user should right-click on the “From” address to add this sender (and his or
   her certificate) to the contacts list.  The external user should make sure to EXPLICITLY TRUST the certificate. This is a very important
   PROCEDURE.  If this step is not completed, any message sent to this user will not be readable.


2. Now that the certificate exchange has been done, the external user must e-mail the Tumbleweed EMF administrator-- so he or she can verify the
   external user’s certificate. The address is Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov. At this point the external user should be sending a SIGNED AND
   ENCRYPTED message.


3. Now that both the Tumbleweed EMF root certificate and the external user’s certificate have been exchanged and verified, the external user and
   the EMF administrator (through the Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov account) will VERIFY that the exchange test messages are being signed/encrypted
   and decrypted/verified.


   When sending E-mail to Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov, the external user must click on the “To...” button and choose Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov from
   the contacts list.  Outlook will not associate Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov proxy certificate with the E-mail if the external user just types
   Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov address in the “To...” field.  E-mail addressed by typing the address in will not go out encrypted.  (A “Non-Secure
   Recipients” alert will be displayed.)


A. For the external user to view his or her certificate, he or she must select “Options...” from the Tools menu of Outlook main window.  He or
   she will have to view the “Security” tab under the Options window.  Finally, he or she will click the button labeled “Encrypted e-mail...” in
   this section the external user will need to select either “add digital signature or encrypt contents and attachments or both.”


B. [pic]


C. A new window titled “Change Security Settings” will appear.  A section called “Digital Signature” will be a little more than halfway down the
   window.  In this section is a button labeled “Choose...”  The external user will have to click on this button to bring up a list of his or her
   certificates.  (Note:  there is another section called “Encryption.”  This should contain the same certificate that the “Digital Signature”
   section has.)


D. In the new window, the external user must choose the certificate he or she is working with by double-clicking it.  This opens the
   “Certificate” window.  The certificate’s thumbprint is under the “Details” tab.  (Note:  Microsoft products display the thumb/fingerprint
   using the SHA1 algorithm while EMF uses the MD5 algorithm.  The external user should explicitly state to the EMF administrator that the
   thumb/fingerprint being read is from SHA1.)










How OUTLOOK Users Obtain Certificates

External users of S/MIME clients must obtain a certificate from a CA and import it into their E-mail client.  This client must be configured for
commercial grade 3DES encryption when communicating with FDA/HHS, as that is a specification mandated by FIPS 140-1.  Although a certificate may
be obtained from any CA, these instructions show how to acquire one from VeriSign, Inc. and import it into Outlook with Internet Explorer.


1. Open the Outlook client program.


2. Pull down the “Tools” menu and select “Options.”


3. Click on the “Security” tab in the “Options window.”


4. Select “Get a Digital ID.”  This will automatically load VeriSign’s web page.


5. From VeriSign’s web page, select “Class 1 Digital ID.”


6. Fill out the form with payment information.  Press the “Submit” button.


7. E-mail from VeriSign Inc. should shortly arrive.  This E-mail has embedded hypertext markup language so that it looks like a web page.  Links
   in this E-mail will lead one through the final steps in importing the certificate.

Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or
offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  “SUBCONTRACT,” as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-
employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor requesting supplies or services required for
performance of the contract or subcontract.

If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Small Business Specialist (SBS) supporting the OPDIV.  SBS contact
information is located on the OSDBU website (http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/staff.html) or you may contact the OSDBU headquarters at (202) 690-7300.

HHS current subcontracting goal is 39.9% for small business, including 8(a) Program Participants (hereafter referred to as SB), 5.00% for Small
Disadvantaged Business, including Alaska Native Corporations (ANC) and Indian Tribes (hereafter referred to as SDB), 5.00% for women-owned
business and economically disadvantaged women-owned business (hereafter referred to as WOSB), 3.00% HubZone business (HUBZone) and 3.00% service
disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed
subcontracting plans to contain at a minimum the aforementioned percentages.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total
estimated subcontracting dollars.  Zero goal statement removed.

Note:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will indicate whether a subcontracting plan is required.  Due to the nature and complexity of many HHS
contracts, particularly the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), the contractor may not be required to submit its subcontracting reports
through the eSRS.   The Contracting Officer will confirm reporting requirements prior to the issuance of an award.  For more information,
contact Teneshia Alston, Agency Coordinator-eSRS (Teneshia.Alston@HHS.GOV).

7.  Record keeping

FAR 19.704(a) (11) requires a list of the types of records your company will maintain to demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the
requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  The following is a recitation of the types of records the contractor will maintain to
demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  These records will include, but not be
limited to, the following:

     a. SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone and SDVOSB source lists, guides and other data identifying such vendors;

     b. Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone and SDVOSB sources;

     c. On a contract-by-contract basis, records on all subcontract solicitations over $100,000, which indicate for each solicitation (1)

8.  Timely Payments to Subcontractors

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your
subcontracts with small business concerns, 8(a), SDB, women-owned small business, HubZone and service disabled veteran-owned small business
concerns.

Your company has established and used such procedures:  ________ yes _________ no


9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, 8(a), small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone small and service disabled veteran owned concerns as
subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make
a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that
liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, SDB,
WOSB, HubZone and SDVOSB small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with
the contracting official prior to approval of the plan.

      independent contractors, and all others who have any access to [     **     ] to abide by the confidentiality and proprietary provisions of
      this Agreement.  All obligations under this paragraph will expire upon termination of the trial subscription unless FDA  purchases  a  full

           in [     **     ].

5. Limitation of Liability: To the fullest extent permitted by Federal law, in no event shall [     *     ] be liable to the FDA  for  any  loss,

   and all copies thereof, together with all documentation related to the [     **     ], unless FDA purchases a  full  subscription  thereafter.
   In the event that a party hereto violates or is in default of any material provision of this Agreement or  the  FDA  is  legally  required  to
   disclose information to a third party, this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice.  Either party  may  terminate  the  Agreement
