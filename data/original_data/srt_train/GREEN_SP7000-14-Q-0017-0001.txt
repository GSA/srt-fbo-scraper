The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-- (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes.

The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

(2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. (h) Patent indemnity. The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final decisions.

(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-- (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 52.212-05 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS COMMERCIAL ITEMS (SEP 2013) FAR (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

52.211-9011 BUSINESS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION (BSM) DELIVERY TERMS AND EVALUATION (MAY 2006) DLAD 52.215-9023 REVERSE AUCTIONS (NOV 2012) (DLAD) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply. (a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation. (b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction. (c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing. (d) The lowest offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction. (e) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted, the "Not Lead" offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; it will be ineligible for award if the final price in the auction is the tie offer price. (f) An offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction. (g) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted. (1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic Agency's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.

(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is embedded within the email notification sent by the on-line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator. (3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other offerors' pricing in confidence until after contract award. (4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control. (5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection. (6) Training: (i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means. (ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a 'trained offeror.' Only trained offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that offerors provide an alternate offeror employee to become a 'trained offeror.' The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the 'trained offeror' designation from any trained offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.

Within 5 business days of the issuance of a task order, the contractor shall deliver the proposed MFDs for each proposed model to DLA Document Services HQ, Bldg. 410, NSA Mechanicsburg, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 for testing, at no cost to the government. The point of contact for the testing will be provided upon award. Estimated time for testing is 15 business days. Testing shall be performed by the DLA Document Services Information Technology Division in coordination with the contractor's assistance. The Contractor shall provide at no additional cost, onsite engineering assistance and other support necessary to configure, setup, and test the equipment as needed. The contractor will collaborate with DLA Document Services to develop the testing evaluation package. If all MFDs pass the testing identified for the Air Force Network Printer and Multifunction Printer Settings and Requirements and in accordance with our COTS Hardware Certification Process, DLA Document Services Contracting Office will provide the Contractor with a Memorandum of Compliance for the applicable MFDs. In the event that not all proposed MFD's pass the testing, DLA Document Services reserves the decision to not recommend the devices to be submitted for award. Prior to the completion of the DLA Document Service's testing period, the contractor will develop and provide the MFD Implementation Guide. The Implementation Guide provides for step-by-step instruction and screen shots to configure the MFDs in accordance with the testing results per the Air Force Network Printer and Multifunction Printer Settings and Requirements.

Any change to a system (to include enclaves) must be reviewed by the IAM (IAWDODI 8510.01). References: DODI 8510.01, November 28, 2007 ˇ The DOD IS IAM has primary responsibility for maintaining situational awareness and initiating actions to improve or restore IA posture. ˇ The IAM continuously monitors the system or information environment for security relevant events and configuration changes that negatively impact IA posture and periodically assesses the quality of IA controls implementation against performance indicators such as security incidents, feedback from external inspection agencies (e.g., IG DOD, Government Accountability Office (GAO)), exercises, and operational evaluations. In addition the IAM may, independently or at the direction of the CA or DAA, schedule a revalidation of any or all IA controls at any time. ˇ The IAM shall annually provide a written or DOD PKI-certified digitally signed statement to the DAA and the CA that indicates the results of the security review of all IA controls and the testing of selected IA controls as required by Reference (a). The review will either confirm the effectiveness of assigned IA controls and their implementation, or it will recommend: changes such as those described in subparagraph 6.3.4.2.; a change in accreditation status (e.g., accreditation status is downgraded to IATO or DATO); or development of an IT Security POA&M. The CA and DAA shall review the IAM statement in light of mission and information environment indicators and determine a course of action that will be provided to the concerned CIO or SIAO for reporting requirements described in Reference (a). The date of the annual security review will be recorded in the SIP. A DAA may downgrade or revoke an accreditation decision at any time if risk conditions or concerns so warrant. The IAM must assess the change to determine if any change in the security posture of the system has occurred. If the change negatively impacted the security posture the IAM must initiate the re-accreditation process for the system (or enclave). If the change does not negatively impact the security posture the IAM must document the change and state that there is no effect on the security posture and sign a letter attesting to that fact. This letter or communication must be included in the current C&A package and be made available to the AF-DAA and the AF-CA for informational purposes. ˇ DODI 8510.01 the IAM shall annually provide a written or DOD PKI-certified digitally signed statement to the DAA and the CA that indicates the results of the security review.
