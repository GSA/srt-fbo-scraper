SECTION B -  SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES


B.1.   PRICING TERMS

Prices are firm and not subject to increase for each fiscal year performance period under this Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  Contract period
shall be for one base year with three (3) one-year option periods.

Prices, services, terms and conditions found in catalogs or brochures do not apply to the extent that they modify or conflict with the prices,
services terms and conditions of this BOA.

FEDLINK customers may sign basic software, database, or electronic publication license agreements for products or services acquired under this
contract; however, terms and conditions of this contract, Federal Law, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) take precedence over any
such license or other agreement.  The rights and obligations provided by the contract shall take precedence over the rights and obligations set
forth in any licensing agreements provided to FEDLINK customers by the vendor.  The Library’s incorporation of a licensing agreement into a
contract via contract modification excludes terms of the licensing agreement that contravene, modify or conflict with the contract. 
Furthermore, even if the Library agrees to incorporate a licensing agreement into the contract, the Library does not agree to provisions that
incorporate the following issues:  Indemnification, compliance with industry standards not imposed by law, choice of law provisions, interest
penalty payments, choice of venue or forum provisions, arbitration clauses, and provisions mandating alternate dispute resolution.

All goods and services acquired through FEDLINK are for official government use only.  It is the customer agency's responsibility to ensure that
its employees (and contractors) are aware of and follow agency rules for using and safeguarding personally identifiable information - including
information accessed through commercial products.

Multiple awards will be made as BOAs.  Delivery orders will be competed among BOA holders.  The Government reserves the right to reopen
competition to new potential BOA holders annually.

All products and pricing offered must be associated with the appropriate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).   The template below is provided as
guidance to Offerors on how to submit a pricing proposal.  Offeror shall recreate the template when preparing their price proposal, if needed.

SECTION C - STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1.  STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1.1.  OBJECTIVE:

To meet the goal of creating foundational foreign language skills, federal agencies must have on-demand, commercially developed language courses
to improve foreign language capability across the government world-wide.   This solicitation is issued to establish a Basic Ordering Agreement
(BOA), a procurement vehicle which defines the terms, conditions and pricing for service from Contractors, for the acquisition of and access to
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Web-based Foreign Language Courseware for FEDLINK member agencies.  Under these Agreements, the government is
not obligated to order, nor the Contractor to furnish, any products and services. However, issuance and acceptable of an order does constitute a
binding agreement between the parties, subject to the terms of the order and the BOA.   The Library anticipates issuing multiple BOAs.

C.1.2.  BACKGROUND:

FEDLINK is a nationwide interagency consortium sponsored by the Library of Congress (LC or The Library) through its Federal Library and
Information Center Committee (FLICC).  FEDLINK offers federal libraries, information centers and other federal activities information retrieval
and library support services to help them fulfill their crucial mission of keeping the Government and the nation informed.  Under the revolving
fund created by the Library of Congress Fiscal Operations Improvement Act, P.L. 106-481, Section 103 (2 U.S.C. §§ 182c.), LC uses its extensive
knowledge of the information industry and library operations to establish contractual agreements for commercial library/information products and
then makes these agreements available to other federal libraries, information centers and other federal activities.  LC/FEDLINK contractual
agreements are established through formal procurement processes that meet the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and
follow the guidance provided by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).  FEDLINK contracting for computer-based services began in 1974
with a delegation of procurement authority (DPA) from the General Services Administration to the Library.  Both the Office of Management and
Budget and the General Accounting Office encouraged the program's development and use by federal agencies.

LC/FEDLINK agreements are available to federal offices in the executive branch (including the department of defense), the legislative branch,
the judicial branch, and independent agencies.  In addition, contractors to government agencies who are authorized to use federal sources of
supply are able to purchase through FEDLINK.  Although the contracts meet the standards demanded by librarians and other information
professionals, LC/FEDLINK customers are not limited to libraries.  Legal offices, laboratories and information centers, analysts, scientists and
other end-users in federal agencies may acquire their electronic publications through FEDLINK.  FEDLINK contracts are negotiated to achieve the
lowest possible price and most favorable terms and conditions.  Vendor sales volume is considered to be an important element to achieve maximum
discounts in each contract.

FEDLINK customers may choose a direct express/invoice relationship with vendors or a “transfer pay” option.  FEDLINK provides fiscal support to
FEDLINK “transfer pay” customers.  When establishing a purchase agreement with LC to use FEDLINK services, the customer may choose to transfer
funds to LC to pay invoices for products/services ordered through the purchase agreement.  Under this "transfer pay" option, the vendor sends
invoices to FEDLINK, where FEDLINK Fiscal Operations (FFO) staff examines them, pay the vendor electronically, and send the customer a statement
of account with copies of the paid vendor invoices.  With transfer pay, the vendor only has to deal with one government financial office and the
customer is relieved of the invoice processing workload.  Terms for the direct express or transfer-pay options, information on delivery
order/purchase order and invoice procedures are described in Section G of this contract.

C.1.3. QUALIFYING CONTRACTORS.  Contractors shall be capable of providing products/services for ordering agencies with multiple organizational
levels and geographic locations nationwide and/or worldwide.  The Contractor shall also be capable of handling multiple purchase orders
simultaneously. Contractors who qualify for the FEDLINK program will be those who demonstrate a thorough understanding of the technical
requirements of the foreign language services described herein; who have the required experience and facilities to provide efficient, quality
services; whose past performance demonstrates reliability and professionalism; and whose prices represent cost savings for the Government and
the FEDLINK membership.

C.1.4. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSALS.  Detailed instructions for the format of proposals are given in Section L - Instructions, Conditions and
Notices to Offerors. Through the proposal, the contractor shall demonstrate understanding of the technical requirements and the capability to
provide the services offered. Contractors may supply sample materials (catalogs, management reports, invoices, etc.) to illustrate the narrative
description of their services required by Section L, but shall not submit such materials in lieu of narrative description.

C.3.  SUMMARY OF CONTRACTING PROCESS

C.3.1. Process for award of a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA)
      a. FEDLINK issues a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the award of single or multiple Agreements for Web-based Foreign Language Courseware
      and related services.
      b. Contractors respond to the RFP with proposals in accordance with the Statement of Work and the Solicitation provisions. (see Section L)
      c. FEDLINK performs Cost and Technical Evaluations and Financial Responsibility Determination.
      d. FEDLINK awards a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) to qualifying Contractors in accordance with
           Section M criteria.

C.3.2. Requests for Quotation (RFQ) Process.
Customers provide preliminary requirements to FEDLINK for Transfer Pay or their local contracting office for Direct Express.  A Request for
Quotation (RFQ) is issued to all Contractors who have been issued BOAs.  Contractors may respond with a Quote in accordance to the terms of the
Request for Quotation.  Quotes are evaluated in accordance with the terms of the RFQ.  Contractors are notified that they are selected for an
order.  Upon receipt of funding, not to exceed (NTE) orders are issued to the recommended Contractor(s) whose Quotation is judged as the best
value to the Government. Final arrangements and any other specific terms are arranged between the Contractor and the Customer.

C.3.2.1.    Pre-Order Competition.  Contractors shall be required to provide price estimates, indicating level of service available, to
registered FEDLINK users for purposes of evaluation before the appropriate Contractor(s) is (are) selected and orders placed.

C.3.2.1 (a)  Request for Quotation (RFQ).  RFQs expected to exceed the micro purchase threshold must be initiated by the Library of Congress
Office of Contracts and Grants Management (LC/OCGM) for transfer pay customers, or by the designated contracting official for direct express
customers.  When federal libraries and offices register for Web-based Foreign Language Courseware services under the FEDLINK program, they will
submit a brief description and specifications required for price quotes from the companies with established FEDLINK foreign language BOAs.
Contractors are not required to respond to each Request for Quotation (RFQ) received under this Agreement.


C.3.2.1 (b)  Contractor Quotation.  Price quotes in response to the RFQ will indicate Contractor’s price at the time of the quote. Volume
discounts should be included as separate prices and will be binding as quoted

C.3.2.1 (c)  Contractor Selection.  The agency’s delivery orders will subsequently be awarded to that Contractor able to provide the required
services for the lowest overall price while meeting the agency’s technical requirements for service.  Contractor shall be evaluated on past
performance, relevant experience, technical comprehension and other factors related to the agency’s special requirements.

C.3.2.1 (d)  Option Years for Agency Orders.  If the Library exercises option years for the overall FEDLINK BOA, transfer pay Agencies may
exercise option years with their previously selected Contractors.  Direct Express agencies are invited to exercise option years for their
orders, but must abide by their local procurement policy.

C.3.2.1 (e)  Multiple Contractors.  Agencies may reserve the right to establish delivery orders with multiple Contractors.  However, in such
cases, RFQs must indicate the intention to select multiple Contractors.  If multiple delivery orders are intended and the aggregate of business
authorized across Contractors would exceed the micro purchase threshold, RFQs shall be used to select Contractors, by LC/OCGM for transfer pay
or by the designated contracting official for direct express accounts.

G.2.  CUSTOMER USE OF FEDLINK CONTRACTS.

The FEDLINK program provides both contracting and accounting support to federal agencies and organizations authorized to use federal sources of
supply.

G.2.1.  ORDERING PROCEDURES.   Customers shall review all products and services offered and shall determine which products and services best
meets the customer agency’s requirements for each order.

G.2.2.  FEDLINK SERVICE OPTIONS.  LC/FEDLINK offers customers two service options for FEDLINK Services:

G.2.2.1.  Transfer Pay.  Under the transfer pay option, a Customer transfers both FEDLINK administrative fees and estimated annual service
dollars to LC via a signed Interagency Agreement authorizing the transfer of funds to LC.  On behalf of the Customer, OCGM issues a delivery
order to the Vendor in the amount specified on the Interagency Agreement.  After receiving the delivery order, the Vendor provides
products/service to the Customer and submits the Customer’s invoices to FEDLINK.  FEDLINK reviews the invoices, rejects improper ones, and pays
acceptable ones from the Customer’s account.  FEDLINK sends the Customer copies of rejected invoices, copies of all paid invoices, and a regular
account statement.  The Customer reviews the invoices and reports any irregularities to FEDLINK, who resolves them with the Vendor.  Transfer
pay processes are described in detail in section G.3.

G.2.2.2.  Direct Pay.   Under the direct pay option, a Customer transfers FEDLINK administrative fees to LC and receives authorization to use an
LC/FEDLINK BOA, but does not transfer service dollars to LC.  Instead,  the Customer Agency’s Contracting Office generates a local purchase
order made out to the Vendor and returns both the signed IAA and the Agency purchase order to LC/FEDLINK.  When the signed IAA and/or purchase
order are received, OCGM generates an authorization to provide products/services under the FEDLINK BOA and forwards the authorization and the
Customer’s purchase order to the Vendor.  The Vendor provides products/services and invoices the Customer directly against the local purchase
order.  Purchase order modifications shall be forwarded to the Vendor through OCGM.  Direct pay processes are described in detail below at G.4.

G.2.2.3.  Vendor Option.  The Vendor is required to offer the transfer pay option to FEDLINK customers.  The Vendor is not required to make
products/services available under the direct pay option.

G.3.  TRANSFER-PAY PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS

G.3.1.      REGISTRATION.  Customers indicate their intent to use LC/FEDLINK contracts by completing the online registration form on the FEDLINK
website at www.loc.gov/flicc , indicate how they intend to transfer service dollars to LC, and establish the funding level for their
products/services by submitting an annual FEDLINK registration form.  Prospective customers may register any time during the fiscal year until a
cutoff date specified by FEDLINK.

G.3.2.      CUSTOMER INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS.   Customer agencies initiate interagency agreements with LC for products/services through the
registration process.  To constitute valid agreements all documents must be signed and accepted both by the requiring agency and by LC/FEDLINK.
After LC signs and returns the interagency agreement, the LC Office of the Chief Financial Officer (LC/OCFO) invoices the agency for the funds
obligated to LC.  LC/Contracts issues delivery orders to the vendors listed in the amounts specified on the interagency agreement.  Upon receipt
of the delivery order the vendor may initiate service for the customer.  Customers may request amendments to their interagency agreement orders
during the year (until a cutoff date specified by FEDLINK), and thus may add or delete products/services and/or change funding levels.
LC/Contracts issues delivery order modifications accordingly.

G.3.3.      INITIATING TRANSFER PAY SERVICE.

G.3.3 (a)  FEDLINK Delivery Order.  LC/Contracts issues a delivery order to the vendor for each FEDLINK customer using the vendor's service in
the transfer pay mode under the LC/FEDLINK contract.  LC/Contracts may also issue delivery order modifications that reflect amendments to
customers' interagency agreements - to change products/services or adjust funding levels, for example.  Upon receipt of the official LC delivery
order, the vendor may begin service for the customer under the terms of the current contract.  The vendor shall not begin, renew, cancel, or
convert to the LC/FEDLINK contract any service for any FEDLINK customer until a delivery order for that customer for that service for the
current fiscal year has been received.  The vendor shall not provide products/services to the customer in excess of the "not to exceed" (NTE)
dollar amount indicated on the original delivery order or as amended by any delivery order modification.  The Government is not liable for
products or services provided which exceed the NTE dollar amount.  Vendors shall invoice only for supplies delivered or services performed --
the NTE amount on the delivery order may be an estimated price and not the final price for supplies or services ordered.  Authority to provide
service under an LC delivery order expires on September 30 of each fiscal year unless specifically stated otherwise on the delivery order.

G.3.3 (b)  Order Acceptance and Notification.  The vendor shall inform FEDLINK Fiscal Operations (FFO) in writing of any account identification
or user identification the vendor has assigned to the customer within a reasonable time from receipt of delivery orders from LC/FEDLINK
Contracts.  This notification confirms the vendor’s acceptance of the order under this contract.  Performance under any FEDLINK delivery order
constitutes Vendor’s acceptance of all contract terms and conditions.  Upon receiving the order, the vendor shall contact the customer
immediately to begin service.  If the vendor questions an order, the questions shall be noted on the delivery order and the delivery order
returned to LC/FEDLINK Contracts within ten (10) days.  Send customer identification via fax or email to the following address:

      The Library of Congress
      FEDLINK Fiscal Operations
      ATTN:   James Oliver, Vendor Services Coordinator
      John Adams Bldg., Room LA-224
      101 Independence Ave., SE
      Washington, D.C.  20540-4935
      Fax #:  202-707-4999;  Email:  joli@loc.gov

G.3.3 (c)  Customer Identification.  FEDLINK assigns a unique four-character FEDLINK ID to each customer.  After receiving the delivery order,
all vendor correspondence and oral communications with FEDLINK regarding customers shall identify the customer by the FEDLINK ID and delivery
order  number for the customer as indicated on the delivery order .  The vendor may also assign its own account numbers, user IDs or other
identifiers to customers, but may not use these identifications instead of the FEDLINK ID.

G.3.4.      FEDLINK INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS.     An invoice is the vendor's bill or written request for payment under the delivery order for
supplies delivered or services performed.  The vendor shall invoice only for the amount of supplies delivered or services performed as the NTE
amount on the delivery order may be an estimated price and not the final price for supplies or services ordered.   FEDLINK's transfer pay
accounting service is intended to help FEDLINK customers manage the Government funds entrusted to them legally, efficiently, and effectively.
FEDLINK simplifies processing and achieves economies of scale for both customers and vendors.  However, with centralized, third party processing
there can be delay in reporting to the customer.  Therefore, it is important that the vendor cooperate with FEDLINK Fiscal Operations (FFO) to
ensure that invoices, usage reports, credits, and refunds are submitted within 30 to 45 days and are complete and accurate.   The vendor shall
prepare invoices and submit them to FFO Invoice Processing, as addressed on the delivery order, for review and processing.   FFO will forward
approved invoices to LC/FSD for payment.  All proper invoices (except summary invoices) and all detailed usage reports shall include the
information specified below and be formatted as specified below.  Invoices that do not meet these specifications are defective.  FFO will reject
them and return them to the vendor without payment.  Invoices for products/services that exceed the funding level authorized on the delivery
order will be rejected for insufficient funds and returned to the vendor without payment.  FEDLINK will not make partial payments to accommodate
customer funding levels.  Rejected invoices will be accompanied by a form indicating the reason for rejection.  The vendor shall promptly
resubmit the invoice when the condition(s) causing the rejection have been corrected.  All inquiries relating to FEDLINK vendor payments should
be directed to:

           Fax:  (202) 707-4961
            Email:  locfliccap@loc.gov

G.3.5.      INVOICE INFORMATION.  The vendor shall supply the following information on all invoices:

G.3.5 (a)  Invoice Data Elements.
      (1)   Vendor identification:
            •  Name and address of the vendor.
            •  LC/FEDLINK Contract Number.
            •  Two-character FEDLINK Service ID assigned to the vendor.
            •  Name and address of the vendor official to whom payment is to be sent via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) (shall be the same as
                       designated in the Contract).
            •  Contact information for person to be notified in event of defective invoice.
      (2)   Customer identification:
            •  FEDLINK ID
            •  Name and address of agency using service
            •  FEDLINK Delivery order number
      (3)   Order information:
            •  Delivery  order/task order date in mm/dd/yyyy format.  Delivery order/task order date is the date the delivery order/task order
                       was signed.
            •  Invoice number.   Invoice number should uniquely identify the invoice.
            •  Invoice date in mm/dd/yyyy format.
            •  Contract line item number, where practicable, or descriptive information sufficient to identify  Schedule B item which
                       corresponds to invoiced item.
            •  Description, quantity, unit, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.
            •  Discount applicable to individual FEDLINK customers, either by line item or against the invoice total, as appropriate.
            •  Any prompt payment discount.
            •  Any other information or documentation required by other specific requirements elsewhere in the Contract (such as evidence of
                       shipment, receipt or prepayment)
            •  An invoice copy submitted as replacement for an original shall be certified as a duplicate original.

G.3.5 (b)  Invoice Number.  Individual invoices shall have unique numbers.  Any invoice (including credit invoices) with a number which
duplicates another invoice's number is defective and will be rejected.

G.3.5 (c)  Fiscal Year of the Invoice.  An invoice reflects individual items/services ordered by the customer in accordance with an authorized
delivery order .  The fiscal year to which an invoice must be charged is governed by the delivery order number, not by the vendor's invoice
date.  Thus, items ordered on September 30th against a current delivery order will be charged to the current fiscal year, even though they may
not be delivered and invoiced until after the next fiscal year has begun.  It is therefore extremely important that the delivery order number
and order date be clearly identified on the invoice and that it correctly reflect the fiscal year with which the particular item orders are
associated.  Invoices for subscriptions shall be clearly distinguishable from reports of usage under the subscription (for which no additional
payment is due.)  The vendor shall not combine charges from separate fiscal years on a single invoice.

G.3.5 (d)    Discounts.  Discounts earned by individual customers shall be calculated on the individual invoice or institution detail for the
FEDLINK customer.  FFO is not responsible for any recalculations to distribute discounts due individual customers.  Prompt payment discount
options approved in the Contract shall be specified on invoices. The option to take a prompt payment discount shall be exercised at the
Government's option.

 G.3.5 (e)  Pagination.  Each page included as part of the invoice(s) must be numbered to indicate their sequence. (Example:  1 of 5, 2 of 5,
etc.)

G.3.6.      INVOICE TYPES.

G.3.6 (a)  Individual Invoices.  The vendor shall supply a separate invoice for each FEDLINK customer as represented by a FEDLINK ID.  The
vendor shall clearly distinguish between an invoice for a subscription for which payment is due from a report of usage under the subscription
(for which no payment is due.)

G.3.6 (b)  Summary Invoices.  The vendor may submit a summary invoice with line items for each FEDLINK customer.  Summary invoices must be
supported by customer-specific detail that enables FFO to review the charges and confirm the amount due from each customer and enables the
customer to confirm that goods/services have been received and that the charges are accurate.

G.3.6 (c)  Usage Detail.  The vendor shall provide detailed information that allows the customer to track use of the vendor's system.  Such data
enables the customer to charge back to agency units for whom access is being administered centrally, to monitor activity levels under a
subscription pricing arrangement, or otherwise to promote effective use of the vendor's products/services.  This data shall be provided in
computer-readable form. Computer-readable usage data supplements, but does not replace, invoice information.  See B.1.3.2 (e) E-metric Usage
Data; FEDLINK is working towards electronic invoicing, with its attendant security requirements.

G.3.6 (d)  Refunds, Credits or Other Adjustments.  All invoice adjustments for transfer pay customers shall be processed through FFO.  FFO shall
determine whether a credit to the customer's account is acceptable or whether a refund is required.  Where credits are acceptable, the vendor
shall issue separate credit invoices for all accrued credit on an individual customer's account and shall indicate on the credit the information
specified above, plus the following:  reference to the original invoice number, original order date, description of credit, credit total.
Invoice adjustments shall have a unique invoice number; the invoice number of the original invoice being adjusted shall not be re-used.  Where
refunds are required, the vendor shall promptly remit amounts due.

G.3.6 (e) Duplicate Invoices.  The vendor shall certify that it has not already received payment for duplicate invoices submitted as
replacements for original invoices as follows:

            Duplicate Original
            Payment Not Received
            Signed ______________________
            Date  _______________________

G.3.6 (f)  Faxed, Emailed and Altered Invoices.  In cases when an invoice is faxed, emailed or altered, the vendor shall certify that it has not
already received payment for the faxed, emailed or altered invoice(s) submitted as replacement of original invoice(s) as follows:

I certify that this is a copy of the original invoice in which payment has not been received.

           Signed___________________Date____________________

Note:  Faxed and Emailed invoices are accepted on a case by case basis only.  We recommend that you submit all invoices via mail as outlined in
G.4.7 (f)

G.3.6 (g) Resubmitted Invoices.  The vendor shall promptly resubmit a rejected invoice when the condition(s) causing the rejection have been
corrected.  The vendor shall resubmit the original invoice and shall clearly identify that the invoice is a resubmission for payment.

G.3.6 (h)  Electronic Invoicing.  As FEDLINK expands the capabilities of its automated accounting system, it may be possible to accept invoice
data electronically via Internet file transfer.


G.3.7.      INVOICE SUBMISSION.

G.3.7 (a) Promptness.  The vendor shall invoice FEDLINK within thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days after providing authorized service to the
customer.  Receiving prompt, current financial data to help them manage the information services they provide their agencies is very important
to FEDLINK customers.  Withholding invoices for authorized users (especially at the beginning of the fiscal year) is not acceptable.

G.3.7 (b)  Frequency.  The vendor shall invoice FEDLINK on a regular cycle.  Exceptions are allowed only by prior written  mutual agreement
between the customer and vendor.

G.3.7 (c)  Sort Order.  The vendor shall submit invoices sorted first by fiscal year, then alphabetically by FEDLINK ID, followed by invoice
number order.  Mixing invoices for different fiscal years, not sorting by FEDLINK ID or other data elements slows FFO processing and is not
acceptable. Invoices will be rejected and returned to the vendor unprocessed.

G.3.7 (d)  Number of Copies.  For each FEDLINK transfer pay customer, the vendor shall provide FFO not less than one original and one copy of
each invoice and not less than one original and one copy of each detailed usage report (in support of the invoice).

G.3.7 (e) Physical Format.  Individual invoice sets shall be attached so that all copies and/or pages of the original invoice remain contiguous.
 If the vendor supplies photocopies of any pages (e.g., to supplement a multi-part invoice), then all invoice photocopies shall be attached to
the original invoice.  Invoices printed on continuous paper sets shall be stripped of letter edge perforation guides.  Invoices shall be
stripped of any interleaved carbon inserts.

G.3.7 (f)    Invoice Address.  The vendor shall submit invoices to the following address:

            The Library of Congress
            FEDLINK Fiscal Operations
            ATTN:  Invoice Processing
            101 Independence Ave. SE
            Washington, DC  20540-4935
            Fax: (202) 707-4927

G.3.7 (g) Final Invoice Call.   FEDLINK is required to close customer accounts for prior fiscal year obligations against appropriations and
funds scheduled for retirement.   FFO issues a final invoice call to vendors each fiscal year to initiate the close-out of prior year contracts.
  Vendors must submit the final invoices to FFO within 90 days from notification.

G.3.8.   INVOICE REVIEW AND PAYMENT.   For purposes of this clause, "invoice payment" means a Government disbursement of monies to a vendor
under a contract or other authorization for supplies or services accepted by the Government.  This includes payments for partial deliveries that
have been accepted by the Government and final costs or fee payments where amounts owed have been settled between the Government and the vendor.
 Payment shall be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or an electronic funds transfer is made.  All days referred to in this
clause are calendar days.  The designated billing office for transfer pay accounts is LC/FEDLINK.

G.3.8 (a)  Return of Improper Invoices.   If the invoice does not comply with requirements herein, then the vendor shall be notified of the
defect within 25 days after receipt of the invoice at the designated billing office.  Untimely notification by the Government shall be taken
into account in the computation of any interest penalty owed the vendor in the manner described in paragraph G.4.9 of this contract.  Rejected
invoices shall be accompanied by a form indicating the reason for the rejection and may be resubmitted when the condition(s) causing the
rejection is corrected.

G.3.8 (b)  Invoice Adjustments.  The Government may adjust invoices to remove charges not valid and not payable under this Contract, such as
line items for excluded products/services, sales tax, freight charges, and prior month billing.  FEDLINK will not make partial payments to
accommodate customer funding levels.

G.3.8 (c)  Payment Due Date.  The due date for making invoice payments shall be the later of the following two events:

      (1)  The 30th calendar day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the vendor.  If the payment due date
      falls on a weekend or holiday, payment will be made on the following business day.

      (2)  The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed by the vendor.  On a final invoice where the
      payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract
      settlement.  However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment
      due date shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the date the vendor's invoice is dated, provided a proper invoice is received and there
      is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or vendor compliance with contract requirements.

G.3.8 (d)   Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) (FAR 52.232-34, MAY 1999).  In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act, all FEDLINK
payment to vendors shall be made via electronic funds transfer (EFT).  The vendor shall complete the "Vendor Survey Form" obtained from LC
FEDLINK Contracts to provide the information necessary to transmit payments to the vendor's financial institution.  Payment shall be considered
as being made on the effective date of the EFT.

G.3.8 (e)  Remittance Advice.  FFO shall provide the vendor contact identified in this Contract with a remittance advice that details the
invoices for which payment covered by LC/FEDLINK payments.  Currently, FFO e-mails the remittance advice to the vendor's Accounts Receivable
contact a few days before the EFT payment is completed.  The vendor should use the remittance advice to update its accounts receivable records.
If an e-mail address is not on file, the remittance will be faxed.

G.3.9.      INTEREST PENALTY PAYMENTS.

G.3.9 (a)  Conditions for Interest Payment.  An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request
from the vendor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in this clause are met, if applicable.  An interest penalty
shall not be paid on agreements issued to foreign vendors outside the United States for work performed outside the United States.  Conditions
for interest payments are:

      (1)  A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office in a timely manner.

      (2)  A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no  disagreement  over  quantity,
      quality, or vendor compliance with any contract term or condition.

      (3)  In the case of final invoice for any balance of funds due the vendor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not
      subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the vendor.

G.3.9 (b)   Interest Rate.  The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 USC 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is prescribed by
other governmental authority.  This rate is referred to as the "Renegotiation Contracted Interest Rate," and is published in the Federal
Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1.  The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice principal payment amount
approved by the Government and shall be compounded in 30-day increments through the payment date, with the first 30-day period beginning the
first day after the due date.  That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period shall be added to the approved invoice principal
payment amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.  If the designated billing office failed to
notify the vendor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed above, then the due date on the corrected invoice shall be adjusted by
subtracting from that date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period, as set out below.  Any interest
penalty owed the vendor shall be based on the adjusted due date.  Adjustments shall be made by the designated payment office for errors in
calculating interest penalties, if requested by the vendor.

G.3.9 (c)  Acceptance for Interest Purposes.  For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the vendor, Government
acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 15th day (unless otherwise specified in the agreement) after the vendor
delivered the supplies or performed the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement, unless there is a disagreement
over quantity, quality, or vendor compliance with a contract provision.  In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive
acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance.  The constructive acceptance
requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make
payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

G.3.9 (d)  Periods Not Subject to Interest.  The following periods of time shall not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:

      (1) The period taken to notify the vendor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this shall not exceed 25 days.

      (2) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the vendor.

      (3) For incorrect EFT information, in accordance with the EFT clause of this agreement.

      (4) Interest penalties shall not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the FAR clause at 52.233-1,
      Disputes, or for more than one year.  Interest penalties of less than $1.00 need not be paid.

      (5) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and vendor over the payment amount or
      other issues involving contract compliance or the amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract.
      Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, shall be resolved in accordance with the FAR clause at 52.233-1, Disputes,
      as amended by the Library.

G.3.9 (e)  Interest on Discounts Taken Improperly.  An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the designated payment office
without request from the vendor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly.  The interest penalty shall be calculated as described
above on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when
payment is made to the vendor, if the underpayment is not corrected within 15 days of the expiration of the discount period.

G.4.   DIRECT  PAY PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS

G.4.1.   REGISTRATION.    Customers indicate their intent to use LC/FEDLINK BOAs by completing the online registration form on the FEDLINK
website at www.loc.gov/flicc , indicate that they intend to use the direct pay method and transfer administrative fee to LC by submitting an
annual FEDLINK registration form.  Prospective customers may register any time during the fiscal year until a cutoff date specified by FEDLINK.

G.4.2.  CUSTOMER INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS.   Customer agencies initiate interagency agreements with LC for products/services through the
registration process.  OCGM issues direct pay notifications to vendors authorizing the amounts specified on the interagency agreement and
purchase order.  Only upon receipt of the direct pay notification and the Agency’s purchase order, may the Vendor initiate service for the
Customer.  Customers may request amendments to their interagency agreements during the year (until a cutoff date specified by FEDLINK), and thus
may add or delete products/services and/or change funding levels.  OCGM issues modifications accordingly.

G.4.3.   FEDLINK DIRECT PAY NOTIFICATIONS and AGENCY PURCHASE ORDERS.  The purchase order shall reference the LC/FEDLINK BOA number and the
Customer’s FEDLINK ID, and shall indicate the purchase order funding level.  Any orders sent directly to the Vendor shall not exceed $100,000.
For all orders over $100,000, LC/FEDLINK will forward the Customer’s purchase order to the Vendor concurrent with the LC/FEDLINK direct pay
notification.  Purchase order modifications shall also be forwarded to the Vendor through LC/FEDLINK.

Upon receipt of the official LC direct pay notification and agency purchase order, the Vendor may begin service for the Customer under the terms
of the current BOA.  The Vendor shall not begin, renew, cancel, or convert to the LC/FEDLINK BOA any service for any FEDLINK Customer until a
direct pay notification for that Customer for that service for the current fiscal year has been received.

The Vendor shall not provide products/services to the Customer in excess of the “not to exceed” (NTE) dollar amount indicated on the purchase
order or as amended by any purchase order modification.  The Government is not liable for services or products provided which exceed the NTE
dollar amount.

Authority to provide products/services under an LC direct pay notification expires 12 months after the notification has been issued, unless
specifically stated otherwise.

G.4.3.1. Customer Identification.  FEDLINK assigns a unique four-character FEDLINK ID to each Customer.  After receiving the LC/FEDLINK direct
pay notification, all vendor correspondence and oral communications with FEDLINK regarding customers shall identify the Customer by the FEDLINK
ID and direct pay notification control number for the Customer as indicated on the notification.  The Vendor may also assign its own account
numbers, user IDs or other identifiers to customers, but may not use these identifications instead of the FEDLINK ID.

G.4.4.  INVOICE PAYMENT FOR DIRECT PAY.  The Vendor shall invoice Customer directly as specified on the Customer Agency’s purchase order.
LC/FEDLINK shall not process invoices for direct pay customers.  Review FAR 52.204-7 and FAR 52.232-33 regarding Central Contractor Registration
(CCR) at:  http://www.acquisition.gov/comp/far/current/html/52_200_206.html




G.5.  EXAMINATION OF VENDOR RECORDS BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS


The vendor agrees that the Library of Congress or any duly authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any books,
documents, papers and records of the vendor involving transactions related to this contract for over-billings, billing errors, and compliance
with the Program Funding Fee clause of this contract. This authority shall expire 3 years after final payment.

G.6.  FEDLINK SERVICES TO VENDORS.

G.6.1.      PUBLICITY.   LC/FEDLINK shall inform FEDLINK customers about the products/services available under the program.  Currently, the
FLICC/FEDLINK World Wide Web site has a section devoted to products/services available to FEDLINK that includes brief descriptions of the
products and services offered by FEDLINK vendors, vendor contact information, and active links to vendor e-mail and websites.  The vendor is
invited to submit its contact and link information for inclusion in this web-based FEDLINK products/services catalog.

G.6.2.      MAILING LISTS.    A mailing list of FEDLINK customers can be provided to the vendor upon request to the address below.

G.7.  CONTACT FOR CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION.  The vendor shall designate a person to serve as the contract administrator for the contract and
orders placed under the contract both domestically and overseas.  The contract administrator is responsible for overall compliance with contract
terms and conditions.  The contract administrator is also the responsible official for issues concerning the FEDLINK Quarterly Sales Reports and
the Vendor’s Report of Direct Express Sales, and the FEDLINK Funding Fee, including reviews of vendor records.  The vendor’s designation of
representatives to handle certain functions under this contract does not relieve the contract administrator of responsibility for contract
compliance.  The name of this individual, along with the person responsible for questions concerning the FEDLINK Funding Fee, must be provided
by the vendor prior to the award of a contract or an order under the contract. Any changes to the designated individual must be provided to the
Contracting Officer in writing, with the proposed effective date of the change.

SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

H.1.  CONTRACTING OFFICER’S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE.   A Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may be designated to represent
the Contracting Officer for the purpose of coordinating with the Vendor in administering the technical aspects of performance for a particular
Customer's account.   For Transfer-Pay Customers, the Interagency Agreement (IAG) point-of-contact as identified on the delivery order will
serve as the COTR for the requiring agency unless otherwise notified.  For Direct Express Customers, the COTR shall be as designated on the
direct-pay notification or Customer agency purchase order.  The COTR may issue written or oral instructions to fill in details in the scope of
work set forth in the contract via the Contracting Officer.  The COTR is not authorized, however, to make any changes that affect the contract
amounts, terms and conditions of the BOA or any order issued under the BOA.  The LC Contracting Officer is the only party authorized to make any
changes that affect the terms and conditions of either the BOA or orders or to bind the Library of Congress.


H.2.   USE OF LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NAME OR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP IN ADVERTISING.
The Vendor agrees not to refer to awards from or contracts with the Library of Congress and/or the FEDLINK program in commercial advertising in
such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service provided is preferred by the Library of Congress or is superior to other products
or services.  The Vendor also agrees not to distribute or release any information that states or implies that the Library of Congress endorses,
uses, or distributes the Vendor's product or service.


H.3.   NEWS RELEASES.   News releases pertaining to this BOA and resultant delivery orders shall not be made without LC/FEDLINK approval, as
appropriate, and then only upon written approval received from the contracting officer.


H.4.   MOST FAVORED CUSTOMER PRICE.   The Offeror warrants and agrees that the prices charged LC/FEDLINK users under this BOA will not exceed
the prices charged by the vendor to its most favored customer for the same item or services in like or comparable quantities; and further
agrees, that any payments received for charges made in excess of prices paid by such most favored customers will be returned to the Government.


H.5.   PROMOTION OF BOA.   The vendor shall promote this BOA to all current FEDLINK customers and federal libraries, as well as other eligible
customers during the life of the BOA.  The offeror’s goals shall be to: (a) make customers aware of this procurement vehicle; (b) make customers
aware of all available products and services; and c) assist customers in creating timely and accurate delivery order/purchase orders.  The
FEDLINK Logo may be used for this purpose in accordance with the provisions of Section H.2.


H.6.    COPY OF BOA AND PRICE SCHEDULE.   Upon request, the vendor shall provide customers with at least one copy of the vendor’s current
LC/FEDLINK BOA or Price Schedule.  Electronic accessibility to price schedules is required.  All BOA and pricing information supplied to
customers shall be identical to the current BOA.


H.7.   CUSTOMER  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REGARDING VENDOR PERFORMANCE.    This clause applies to all contracts estimated to exceed $25,000.
Customer agencies are required to submit a past performance evaluation form at the completion of each fiscal year or contract performance period
(see attachment J.2).  The contracting officer will provide copies of any reports received to the Vendor, and the Vendor will have 30 calendar
days from receipt to submit a rebuttal and/or a report of corrective actions taken.   The past performance evaluation will be placed in the
Vendor’s past performance file and will be available to any federal agency upon request for a period of 3 years.

H.8.   VENDOR  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

H.8.1. Quarterly Summary of FEDLINK User Activity.  The vendor shall submit quarterly the agency name, point-of-contact (POC), and total dollars
obligated for the services provided under this BOA.  The vendor may use the sample FEDLINK Quarterly Summary Report Forms provided (see
attachment J.1.) or develop a computerized report as long as it provides the information identified below.  Reports shall be suitable for import
into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and shall be sent via email to the Contracting Officer as listed in section G.1.  To facilitate FEDLINK
reporting of usage, reports shall provide the following information:

           ( Agency name

H.8.2.  Deadline.  The reports shall be received in the FEDLINK Contracts Office within forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of the
particular reporting fiscal year quarter.

H.8.3.  Failure.  Failure on the part of the vendor to comply with this requirement shall constitute an "incomplete package" for invoicing
purposes for transfer pay customers and no payment shall be made to the vendor until the reports are received.


H.9.    COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 508.    Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C.§794d), federal agencies must give disabled employees and members of the
public access to technology that is comparable to the access available to others.  The law applies to all federal agencies when they develop,
procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology.  Inaccessible technology interferes with an individual's ability to obtain and
use information quickly and easily.  Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new
opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals.  Vendors are
responsible for providing federal customers with all necessary information as reasonably requested regarding product compliance with Section 508
requirements.


H.10.   LICENSE AGREEMENTS.    Vendors frequently have license agreements for their electronic products and services.  Some licenses are for the
vendor's proprietary products; other licenses simply pass-through terms established by the original publisher.  LC/FEDLINK contracting officers
shall not sign license agreements for the products/services that agencies acquire through LC/FEDLINK contracts.  The products/services are used
in the requiring agency and the licenses are signed and enforced by the requiring activity itself.  This means that licenses shall be reviewed
by the agency's attorneys, contracting officers, or other appropriate officials.  Licenses that are ill-suited to federal customers are likely
to have difficulty being approved.

Customers and vendors are free to negotiate licenses separately.  Such individual licenses shall only pertain to the customer for whom they were
negotiated.  When negotiating redistribution rights, vendors must consider that individuals legitimately associated with the requiring activity
must be able to use the information resources the agency intends to provide for them. Upon request, FEDLINK shall assist vendors and FEDLINK
customers in negotiating licenses to be applied in their local environments.  Licenses presented when users logon to a system that instruct the
user to "Click here to accept" or otherwise interactively agree to a standard license, do not supersede the terms of this BOA.

FEDLINK requests that vendors adapt their commercial licenses for FEDLINK customers by modifying the relevant clauses, by including a special
section for the federal market, or by prefacing the license with language such as the following:

All of the terms and conditions set forth in this license agreement are governed by the language of FAR 52.212-4, as well as the terms of the
FEDLINK contract.  In the event any language in the terms and conditions of this license conflict with the governing FAR clauses or other
federal law, the FAR clauses and federal law take precedence.

The rights and obligations provided by the contract shall take precedence over the rights and obligations set forth in any licensing agreements
provided to FEDLINK customers by the vendor.  The Library’s incorporation of a licensing agreement into a contract via contract modification
excludes terms of the licensing agreement that contravene, modify or conflict with the contract.  Furthermore, even if the Library agrees to
incorporate a licensing agreement into the contract, the Library does not agree to provisions that incorporate the following issues: 
Indemnification, compliance with industry standards not imposed by law, choice of law provisions, interest penalty payments, choice of venue or
forum provisions, arbitration clauses, and provisions mandating alternate dispute resolution.

      (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.
(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the
increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or
negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.
(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the
increase in the applicable established price.
(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor’s written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any
undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.

Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001 and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  All days referred to
in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified.

                       contract settlement.

                   ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with
                 the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the
                 Contractor’s invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over
                 quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements.

liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.

contracting officer’s decision, to the Government Accountability Office Contract Appeals Board, 441 G Street N.W., Room 7182, Washington, D.C.
20548.  Facsmile:  202-512-9749;   E-Mail:  CAB@gao.gov.

(g) Interest Penalty.  Claims shall not be assessed interest penalty.

      SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1.  EVALUATION CRITERIA

M.1.1.      Vendor selection will be based on evaluation of proposals in accordance with the responses received to the criteria outlined in
      Section L, Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors and the Schedule of Prices.  Award will be made to those offerors whose
      combination of technical and price proposals represents the lowest price that is technically acceptable, however, the degree of importance
      of cost could become greater depending upon the similarity of services offered in the technical responses.

M.1.2.      The Library of Congress reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received and/or request for clarification or modification
      of proposals.  The Library reserves the right to determine a competitive range for negotiation based upon the technical and cost
      acceptability of proposals.  In addition, the Library reserves the right to award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) without discussions.

M.1.3.      Technical evaluators will not have access to cost data until such time as they present to the Contracting Officer a final technical
      ranking of all proposals.  A merger of the two evaluations, cost and technical, will then be conducted to select the optimum proposal or
      proposals on which further negotiations will be conducted.

M.1.4.      Price evaluation will include an analysis of the total pricing and pricing elements of the base and option years, (if applicable) to
      perform the required work.  The total prices supplied by the offeror shall be submitted on a copy of Section B in the spaces provided and
      shall constitute the total firm-fixed unit price for that service or deliverable.

M.1.5.      Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unreasonably low or high in cost or price will be deemed
      reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk involved in the
      requirements for a BOA and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.  Evaluation factors for award are listed below in descending order
      of importance.

M.2.  EVALUATION FACTORS

M.2.1.   Technical Factors

(a) Comprehensiveness of Technical Approach.  The offeror’s responses must be based on an adequate description and justification for the overall
      methodology for services as described in Section C.

(b) Understanding.  The offeror must understand the requirements and problems associated with the delivery of Web-based Foreign Language
      Courseware services to federal libraries and information centers world-wide, including consortia arrangements and differing needs of
      various agencies, as well as, other requirements needed to support federal libraries and information centers globally as specifically
      outlined in Section L.3.1.

(c) Past Performance.   Offeror’s response must address the quality, soundness, completeness, and feasibility of the offeror's project approach,
      including quality of staff, utilization of staff, and plan for continuity.   The offeror shall provide evidence of substantial recent
      experience in providing Web-based Foreign Language Courseware services.

(d) Management.  The offeror’s response must indicate evidence that their firm employs substantial personnel capable of handling all phases of
      service as required by Section C - Statement of Work.

(e) Sample Reports and Invoices.  The offeror shall provide samples of all required reports and include all pertinent information required by
      the government.

M.2.2.   Cost Factors.  See M.1.1. through M.1.5. above.

(a) Cost Reasonableness.  The Government may reject an offer if it is materially unbalanced as to prices for the basic requirement and the
      option quantities.  An offer is unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices that are
      significantly overstated for other work.


M.3.  PRICE EVALUATION

M.3.1.      Cost or price will not be assigned a numerical weight, point score, or adjectival rating.  Price evaluation will include an analysis
      of the prices (inclusive of the option year pricing) to determine whether it is reasonable and to determine the Offerors’ understanding of
      the work and ability to perform the required work.
