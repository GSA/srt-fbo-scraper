INTRODUCTION

The NRC was created as an independent Agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected. It regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection and enforcement of its requirements. The NRC's headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and it has a number of other offices around the United States. The NRC currently uses a U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Seat Management services contract task order to provide agency-wide Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and support services. The final option year for the order ends on September 27, 2010 (with the potential of being extended until December 27, 2010).

Table 1 - Current Contracts providing ITISS Services at the NRC

It is the intention of the NRC to consolidate all of these services into the Information Technology Infrastructure and Support Services (ITISS) contract. Some of the additional tasks describe activities that are not currently being performed at the NRC. It is the NRC's expectation that some of the additional tasks will be awarded within months of initial contract award. Assuming the offeror demonstrates a high-level of performance in delivering the core tasks and initial additional tasks, the NRC intends to award the remaining additional tasks. Offerors intending to propose solutions that will be hosted external to NRC-owned facilities for either core or additional services must clearly demonstrate that they have experience providing such solutions adhering to all of the security and performance requirements of the Federal Government and the NRC. In order to provide an accurate account regarding the current state at the NRC, the SOW provides significant detail on current inventory and corresponding management practices. While this level of detail may appear to dictate specific technologies or solutions in many places, the NRC is very open to the proposal of innovative technologies and/or solutions that would provide greater efficiencies (including "green improvements" which would decrease the environmental impact of NRC work practices) and/or better service. In proposing innovative improvements, the NRC is also interested in timeframes and roadmaps to migrate from "as is" to the proposed "to be." The NRC is not flexible about IT security requirements or performance requirements; all innovative proposals must adhere to security and performance requirements of the Federal Government and the NRC. The offeror shall provide hardware and software used by the offeror in the performance of work under this contract (e.g. personal computers for the offeror's staff, network management software tools, etc.) and incorporated into the price for the proposed services.

Page 4 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
The NRC also expects the offeror to comply with all requirements set forth in NRC Management Directives (MD) (see http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doccollections/management-directives). The offeror should review and understand the following specific MDs related to Information Technology at the NRC: MD 2.3 Telecommunications; MD 2.6 Information Technology Infrastructure; MD 2.7 Personal Use of Information Technology; MD 2.8 Project Management Methodology; MD 12.1 NRC Facility Security Program; MD 12.2 NRC Classified Information Security Program; MD 12.3 NRC Personnel Security Program; MD 12.5 Automated Information Security Program; MD 12.6 NRC Sensitive Unclassified Information Security Program; and MD 12.7 NRC Safeguards Information Security Program. MDs may be periodically updated during the course of this contract, and the offeror shall comply with updated versions. It is also expected that prospective vendors consider the agency's goals and objectives, which include identifying and implementing green improvements, when planning for innovative solutions.

C.3.5

Intent for Mutual Cooperation between Offeror and NRC Staff

The NRC wishes for the chosen offeror to mutually cooperate with NRC staff. Such cooperation would meet the needs and desires of both the offeror and the NRC in a costeffective way. For example: 1. The NRC desires an offeror that will leverage technology in their proposal to provide excellent service at a reasonable cost to both the offeror and to the NRC; 2. Throughout the course of the contract, the NRC intends to actively solicit suggested changes in behaviors or the environment that will result in cost savings that can be reinvested in improved service or additional services; 3. The NRC is interested in continual improvement of service delivery using an Information Technology Infrastructure Library version 3 (ITIL v3)-based service delivery model. The offeror shall provide service delivery using appropriate ITIL v3 best practices and assist the NRC in maturing its overall service delivery; 4. Within this document, occasional reference is made to the offeror providing their "best effort" to accomplish a service that is difficult to predict (e.g. support of printers that are not owned by the offeror, but rather are owned by the NRC). For the purposes of this document, "best effort" will include such activities as: ˇ ˇ ˇ Installation of software/hardware/drivers Testing to verify software/hardware works Limited troubleshooting

When problems are identified, a "best effort" service support would include using the following resources to try and resolve the problem: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Internal resources ­ technicians, developers Internet Manufacturer Support Attempt work around

Page 5 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
If none of these attempts are successful, the problem shall be returned to the NRC for resolution. The offeror shall not apply Service Level Requirements (SLRs), as outlined in Appendix A ­ Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, A.4 Service Level Requirements, to "best effort" service provisioning, other than to issue a ticket that will be logged into the service desk system for the Agency's use in tracking whether or not the problem has been resolved. Open "best effort" tickets are not to be included in calculating any performance-based SLRs. All offerors will be required to provide references on their past performance with previous clients.

C.3.6

NRC Reserved Rights

NRC reserves the right to refuse the introduction of solutions proposed by the vendor if they are inconsistent with either Federal or NRC policy. This is of specific concern in the area of IT security where the NRC must comply with the Federal Information Security Act (FISMA) and the FISMA standards provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The NRC also reserves the right to inspect any part of the ITI at any time. Specific NRC staff with IT security responsibilities shall be granted access to all components of the NRC ITI at all times to facilitate these inspections. 1. NRC will perform periodic reviews to ensure that the systems produce audit records that contain sufficient information to, at a minimum, establish what type of event occurred, when (date and time) the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome (success or failure) of the event and the identify of any user/subject associated with the event; 2. NRC will have unrestricted access to IT system audit tools and generated audit log information; and, 3. NRC will monitor and independently validate the implementation of NIST 800-53 security controls. NRC will be able to monitor data flow and will be able to investigate through the use of NRC approved tools any instance or areas where suspicious or abnormal activity occurs.

C.3.7

C.4

NRC ENVIRONMENT

This section provides detailed information on the current environment, the existing hardware/software infrastructure, and the expected ITI user levels at the NRC. The staff levels are approximate and may vary over time. The environment and software/hardware infrastructure are provided as guidelines to assist in creating an appropriate proposal. The NRC is seeking proposals that address the requirements of this SOW. The offeror's proposed solution can be different than the current solution for those requirements. C.4.1 Staff Levels The current NRC level of 5,500 personal computer users (including both NRC employees and NRC contractors) is expected to grow at a rate of 3% per annum. This growth is not guaranteed but should be incorporated for planning purposes. C.4.2 NRC Locations Information on the NRC locations can be found on the website at http://www.nrc.gov/aboutnrc/locations.html. The NRC has its Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, and a number of other offices around the United States. ˇ The six-building headquarters complex (http://www.nrc.gov/aboutnrc/locations/hq.html) in Bethesda and Rockville, Maryland, houses our headquarters staff and our Public Document Room (http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/pdr.html). There are approximately 4000 ITI users at these locations. During the ITISS period of performance, four of these buildings will be consolidated to a single new building that will be constructed (See paragraph below and section C.6.12 Extraordinary Move Support). The offeror shall provide the services described in this SOW both in the current headquarters buildings and the future headquarters building. It is expected that there will be some reduction in cost for some services once those buildings have been consolidated into a single building adjacent to the White Flint headquarters complex. ˇ The Region I Office (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/locations/region1.html) in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, oversees our regulatory activities in the northeastern United States. There are approximately 211 ITI users at this location. The Region II Office (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/locations/region2.html) in Atlanta, Georgia, oversees our regulatory activities in the southeastern United States. There are approximately 175 ITI users at this location. The Region III Office (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/locations/region3.html) in Lisle, Illinois, oversees our regulatory activities in the northern midwestern United States. There are approximately 189 ITI users at this location. The Region IV Office (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/locations/region4.html) in Arlington, Texas, oversees our regulatory activities in the western and southern midwestern United States. There are approximately 160 ITI users at this location. The On-Site Representative High-Level Waste Management Office (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/locations/hlw-office.html) in Las Vegas, Nevada, maintains information associated with the proposed high-level waste repository (http://www.nrc.gov/waste/hlw-disposal/reg-initiatives/review-site-

recommend.html).There are approximately 20 personal computers supported at this location. ˇ The NRC Technical Training Center (http://www.nrc.gov/aboutnrc/locations/training.html) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, provides training for the staff in various technical disciplines associated with the regulation of nuclear materials and facilities. There are approximately 28 ITI users at this location. The NRC also has onsite inspectors permanently stationed at each reactor licensee that it regulates (http://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/reactor/). These Resident Inspectors require broadband access to the NRC network and use applications that are hosted at NRC Headquarters, the Regional Offices, and on the internet. There are currently over 100 locations that must be supported. The NRC ITI is extended to an application support facility. This facility is provided by an application development support contractor. The work performed under that contract is outside the scope of ITISS. The application support contractor supplies the Wide Area Network (WAN) connection from this facility to NRC Headquarters and provides the network router at the application facility end of that connection. The application support contractor manages that router. A domain controller and personal computers shall be supplied by the ITISS offeror. In addition, the ITISS offeror shall supply help desk support, desk-side support, and network monitoring for the equipment provided and the network at the application support facility. There are approximately 75 ITI users at this location.

ˇ

ˇ

From Fiscal Years (FY) 2013 ­ 2015, the NRC will centralize all headquarters staff not currently located in One White Flint North or Two White Flint North into a new building in Rockville, Maryland. The NRC anticipates 1500 staff moves in FY 2013, and 6000 extra staff moves in each of FY 2014 and FY 2015 to achieve consolidation (some people will be moved more than once). These moves are in addition to the current average annual moves of 1000. Appendix C provides square footage and descriptions of the space that will be available to the ITISS offeror's staff. While the primary computing and support facilities are located at the Headquarters campus, each regional office also maintains local computing and support capabilities, including some local email functions (Exchange satellite servers) which are provided by the incumbent ISSC contractor. The offeror shall provide dedicated system administration support at the Regional Offices to maintain network components and servers. The offeror's staff will be primarily responsible for the management of the Regional Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Network (WAN) interfaces. In addition, they will provide Tier 2 Help Desk support as well as desk-side support as requested by a Regional Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR). Currently, user support is primarily provided by NRC Regional staff or non ITISS contractors. During the ITISS period of performance, there will be additional remote sites that will be added to the ITI due to the construction of new nuclear power facilities. The offeror shall provide network devices (local router, etc.), personal computer equipment for the site, and network management for that segment of the network as if it were a Resident Inspector site. It is unknown precisely when each new power plant will be constructed, but there is information available about the locations of the proposed sites (http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/col/new-reactor-map.html) and the current licensing schedule (http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/new-licensing-files/new-rx-

licensing-app-legend.pdf). However, only the licensee will determine if and when construction will begin. C.4.3 NRC Business Hours Currently normal working hours are 6am-9pm Eastern Standard Time/Eastern Daylight Time (EST) Monday thru Friday excluding Federal Holidays. Maintenance and production changes typically shall not be made during normal working hours. However, it should be noted that new organizational changes allow users to report to work as early as 5am. As such, through results from trending and analysis, it may be necessary to adjust these hours either way throughout the life of the contract. Some specific functions require 24 x 7 x 365 support ­ these are noted within the SOW. C.4.4 Existing Information Technology Infrastructure The following diagram provides an overview of the existing technology infrastructure for the Core functionality and the two Data Center additional tasks. All information provided in this section of the document is intended for informational purposes only and should not be construed to dictate preference.

C.4.4.1 Personal Computing Environment (Desktop/Laptop Computers)

C.4.4.1.1 Hardware For the current base of approximately 5,500 personal computer users the NRC currently has: ˇ ˇ ˇ 5,450 desktop computers furnished by the incumbent ISSC contractor; 310 laptop computers that are managed under the current IT infrastructure and furnished by the incumbent ISSC contractor; Approximately 1000 Government-furnished laptop computers that are not managed by the current incumbent ISSC contractor. These Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) laptop computers are in the process of moving from non-managed to managed under the current ITI contract; and, 100 High-performance computing workstations furnished by the Government.

ˇ

All computers provided under the current contract are supported on a 3-year refresh cycle. These personal computers are distributed in approximate proportion to the number of NRC staff located in our Regional Offices and satellite offices as outlined in section C.4.2 NRC Locations. C.4.4.1.2 Software The following (Table 2) are a sample of the typical software found on current NRC personal computers (PCs) (Desktops/Laptops). In some cases a mix of previous generation products and newer generation products exist (e.g. Microsoft Office). Under the new contract the NRC expects to license current generation products. Note, the Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) is a Government-owned system. ADAMS is a document management system written in Visual Basic, based on IBM FileNet and includes a client-based software component.

c) PowerBuilder 8 supports specific legacy applications. This application is not part of the standard image. Support requirements only include installation on an as needed basis and minor troubleshooting. d) The current operating system (OS) is Windows XP. The NRC has currently elected not to upgrade to Windows Vista, but will upgrade to Windows 7. The NRC shall have the option to upgrade to a new OS within 6 months of release, but may elect not to upgrade if it is deemed unwise. C.4.4.2 General Server Environment The NRC general server environment consists of network servers, file servers, and those servers used within the NRC which support the general network environment (shared storage, electronic mail, network management). These servers are primarily owned by the incumbent ISSC contractor. C.4.4.2.1 Hardware The NRC general server environment currently consists of one-hundred seventy-five (175) servers. These servers consist of machines with one to four central processing units (CPUs) or in the case of dual-core or quad-core processors, one to four processing cores. None of the current servers utilize more than four CPUs or a total of four processor cores. The majority of servers in the general server environment run Windows; however, some run a Linux kernel. Specifically, the current general server breakdown is as follows: ˇ ˇ Wintel Servers with 1-4 CPUs: One-hundred sixty-five (165) servers; and, Unix/Linux Servers with 1-4 CPUs: Ten (10) servers.

The offeror will propose a server refresh cycle. The NRC is flexible, but in general believes no server should be allowed to forego support. C.4.4.2.2 Software The following is a sample of the typical software found on current NRC Servers in the general server environment. The environment is evolving, and specific applications may vary at the time of contract award. The intent of this list is to define the general types of software currently in use. ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Active Directory; Asset Management System (WiseTrack); BlackBerry Enterprise Server; CiscoWorks; Citrix; Finjan; Helpdesk Ticketing System (BMC Service Desk); IronPort; LANDesk Management Suite; Microsoft Exchange Enterprise;

Application Hosting Server Environment (Additional Task)

The Application Hosting server environment (also referred to as NRC Data Center Environment) consists of those servers that generally are used for hosting specialized applications. These servers are currently primarily owned by the NRC. The NRC would prefer that all components of the ITI eventually be offeror-supplied as the GFE reaches the end of its useful life. C.4.4.3.1 Hardware The NRC Data Center environment currently consists of 323 servers. As with the general server environment hardware described in Section C.4.4.2.1 General Server Environment: Hardware, all of the Data Center servers consist of machines with one to four CPUs or in the case of dual-core or quad-core processors, one to four processing cores. The agency also takes advantage of processor time on an NIH mainframe server for some of its legacy applications. There are printers located within the NRC that are connected to these NIH systems which the incumbent Data Center Facilities Operations contractor maintains and manages both the printers and the printout sorting. In addition, the incumbent Data Center Facilities Operations contractor occasionally works with NIH personnel and contractors to troubleshoot connection problems as directed by the NRC PM. C.4.4.3.2 Software Other than custom software or applications developed specifically for the purpose of meeting NRC requirements, the software expected in the Data Center environment is similar to that described for the general server environment in Section C.4.4.2.2 General Server Environment: Software, with the addition of VMWare. C.4.4.4 Network Appliance, Printers, and Other Hardware Appendix B ­ NRC WAN Connections provides a diagram of the basic topology and link speeds of the NRC network. The offeror is not responsible for providing the WAN links, but is responsible for coordinating with the Provider to troubleshoot incidents and determine root cause. The offeror is not responsible for the links between buildings or the cabling plant itself.

Page 14 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
In addition to the desktop/laptop, general server, and data center server environments, the NRC has other hardware components and devices that serve as part of the IT Infrastructure. This additional hardware consists of: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Network appliances including routers, switches, gateways; Network security appliances and firewalls; Tape back-up devices; Redundant Array of Independent Disk (RAID) devices and/or Storage Area Networks (SAN); Network Printers (both color and black & white); Local printers; and, Scanners and plotters.

The following table (Table 3) provides a current list of hardware that falls in this category. It is expected that an ITISS vendor will initially manage this existing hardware and then as required, replace components with suitable current-day replacements. By "current-day" the NRC means current as of the date of replacement.

C.5

CORE SERVICES

This section describes services to be provided under the Core ITISS contract. These services consist of basic infrastructure support services (e.g. messaging, file and print) in alphabetical order, followed by a further description of the NRC's and offeror's service delivery and management responsibilities. The responsibilities are structured in terms of the ITIL v3. It should be noted that the offeror shall include a transition schedule and pricing in the proposal which is described in Section C.7 Transition Considerations. Within this SOW, there is a description of the building space provided by the NRC to the incumbent ISSC contractor's staff (See Appendix D: Space Currently Used by Contractors Performing ITISS Core and Additional Tasks). The offeror shall be responsible for providing staff to address all of the requirements described in this SOW, even if the number of staff required to do that exceeds the office space allocated by the NRC for those offeror staff. The offeror shall include in their proposal how they intend to use NRC provided space as well as how they intend to use any additional office space (provided by the offeror) to fulfill the SOW requirements. The offeror's proposal shall include any connectivity that a facility will require to the NRC ITI, and how it addresses Federal and NRC requirements for physical security, personnel security, and IT security. Any costs associated with an offerorsupplied facility shall be incorporated into the offeror's cost proposal. C.5.1 Basic Infrastructure Support Services Each of the following subsections describes a core service to be provided under the base contract. As a general rule, the services in this section are primarily describing "what will be managed." Taken together with the ITIL-based services described in Section C.5.2 Service Delivery and Management Responsibilities, they should be considered the main body of work to be included in the core tasks. Also, the Service Level Requirements found in Appendix A ­ Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, A.4 Service Level Requirements were designed to correlate with technical requirements of the SOW and should be referred to when the offeror is developing its proposal. C.5.1.1 BlackBerry The contractor shall be responsible for providing blackberry service for NRC staff located in the United States and outside of the United States within the parameters described below. The NRC currently furnishes approximately 1000 BlackBerrys. The current device and service providers are Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T. Mobile access to email, the Web, and mobile applications has become increasingly important as the mission of the Agency has expanded, the Agency workforce has changed, and flexibility in the workplace has increased. Many Agency users are regularly away from their offices but still have a need to stay connected to their co-workers to meet mission objectives. Other users are required to attend meetings and still respond rapidly to staff decision requests. Some Agency users frequently travel outside of the country and need to maintain access to the same functionality on their BlackBerry that they have locally. There are other users that only travel oversees occasionally, but require that same continuity of service internationally. Since NRC users are based all over the United States, it is also important that service plans provide availability where the staff member is located. In addition, the offeror shall:

Page 17 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
1. Manage BlackBerry accounts and the interface with corresponding Microsoft (MS) Exchange email accounts according to optimization standards recommended by Research In Motion (RIM) Corporation; 2. Maintain the high-availability BlackBerry infrastructure within the NRC so that a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) failure will not result in loss of availability to BlackBerry users; 3. Monitor BlackBerry infrastructure for any events and manages capacity of the service; 4. Provide all BlackBerry capabilities available by the device and service plan providers that meet Federal IT security policy requirements and NRC-specific security requirements as requested and approved by the NRC; 5. Enforce secure access to BlackBerry devices through a strong device password policy; Remotely erase data contained on BlackBerry devices that have been lost or stolen at the request of the NRC. 6. Minimize the amount of time that a user is without a blackberry unit (due to either provisioning or repair); and, 7. Minimize the length and frequency of service outages. Currently BlackBerry support is performed under two separate contracts. Support under the core services is limited to: 1. BlackBerry Integration with Exchange 2. BlackBerry Enterprise Server(s) (BES) Management: Manage accounts for BlackBerry users and links between e-mail device and BlackBerry devices. 3. BlackBerry Services Monitoring 4. User Support for account issues and minor device issues 5. BlackBerry Policy Management 6. BlackBerry Device Firmware Upgrades and Management 7. BlackBerry Device and Function Testing: Evaluate new BlackBerry devices and/or functions and test them to ensure appropriate security and functionality. Other BlackBerry support is included in the additional wireless services task in Section C.6.4 Wireless Communications Services. The following services are not included in the Core Services and are listed in this section only to provide clarity around BlackBerry support. The services included in the additional task are: 1. Inventory and reconciliation of the wireless inventory of services and hardware in the Office of Information Services (OIS) Infrastructure and Computer Operations Division (ICOD) Computer Operations and Telecommunications Branch (COTB) NRC Space and Property Management System (SPMS) property account and the telecommunications expense management (TEM) tool; 2. Property storage and control of on-hand wireless hardware;

Page 18 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
3. Service request processing using both the Government provided service desk ticket request system and the TEM tool to process and fill the appropriate orders to meet the Government's approved requirements; 4. Offeror acquisition of BlackBerry devices for lease to NRC; 5. Property distribution/return; 6. BlackBerry server support in the area of assisting the Government in identifying service problems for the end users that may make their appearance known on the server; such as a missing PIN, etc; 7. User device/service training to ensure that the user is familiar with the device they are issued; to allow them to place and receive cellular calls; unlock their BlackBerry, the procedures for charging and caring for the devices, etc; 8. Coordinating with the wireless carriers and the Government customer on the movement of a cellular number from one device to another using the same carrier or between carriers; 9. Pairing Bluetooth hardware (headsets, vehicle mount, vehicle charger, and GPS navigation utility, etc.) with cellular devices when requested; and 10. Preparing cellular phones and BlackBerry devices for issuance in the fulfillment of an authorized work order. Currently, the NRC is satisfied with BlackBerry devices and the interconnections with the agency's email system. The NRC is open to other mobile computing devices over time (See C.5.1.4 Personal Computing and Related Software Licensing). However, the NRC would like to maintain a standard with a manageable set of devices and does not want to incur significant costs or complexity associated with managing too many mobile platforms. C.5.1.2 Electronic Mail (Email) and Messaging

The NRC currently uses Microsoft Exchange 2007 and Outlook 2007 for delivering its email service. Generally users are allocated one (1) gigabyte (GB) of network storage space for mail. Outlook Web Access is also available for users to access their email remotely. Electronic mail services have been integrated with both NRC customized and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software applications (i.e. Microsoft Office, Microsoft SharePoint, ADAMS, etc.) to allow for collaboration and storage of official records. The offeror shall evaluate the current use of e-mail storage at the NRC and make recommendations about appropriate per user e-mail storage allocations. These recommendations will include definitions of distinct user classes which may have different email storage allocation requirements. The offeror shall also recommend an appropriate incremental increase in e-mail storage allocation per user/per year. The offeror shall provide pricing for this incremental storage. The offeror shall: 1. Manage, operate, maintain, administer and support NRC email services including internal email as well as Internet email capability; 2. Define and maintain users, distribution groups and system profiles; 3. Develop and maintain workflow definitions for the mail system environment;

Page 19 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
4. Monitor mail statistics such as inbound and outbound mail flow; 5. Provide metrics on system-related incidents and events; utilize this data to detect and resolve systemic problems; 6. Monitor email system utilization and disk space usage and enforce Agency email size limitations; 7. Track and remove messages at the request of the NRC operational security staff when classified or Safeguards information spills occur or when data leakage occurs; 8. Review systems logs, email and performance data to ensure optimum system operation; 9. Respond to and resolve all user issues related to internal email services or Internet email service; 10. Provide software updates and security updates for the email desktop client as well as the back-end email applications, following NRC Release and Deployment Management Plans; 11. Perform nightly E-mail back-ups and maintain them in accordance with NRC retention requirements; 12. Monitor electronic mail storage and provide increased capacity (up to 10%) as appropriate on an annual basis; 13. Provide, manage, operate, maintain, administer and support a secure instant messaging (IM) service between users within the NRC ITI (the NRC is currently integrating Microsoft Office Communication Server into its production environment ); 14. Provide, manage, operate, maintain, administer and support a unified messaging service that will provide NRC users with a computer-based interface for email, voice mail, PBX, and messaging (the NRC does not currently use unified messaging); 15. Restore email from back-up as requested; 16. Manage replication of e-mail from NRC headquarters data center to a designated disaster recovery site to ensure continuity of e-mail once NRC initiates a Continuity of Operations (COOP) event; 17. Manage the interface between Microsoft (MS) Exchange email accounts and their corresponding BlackBerry accounts according to optimization standards recommended by Microsoft Corporation; 18. Minimize the amount of time that a user is without an e-mail account/client (due to either provisioning or repair); 19. Minimize the length and frequency of service outages; 20. Minimize the time necessary to periodically backup data, and to restore electronic messaging data from backups; and, 21. Minimize the time necessary to provision increased storage capacity when requested The offeror shall provide upgrades to Outlook and Exchange (e.g. Exchange 2010) as these products become available and when they are approved by the NRC. The offeror shall

Page 20 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
ensure that no additional cost is incurred by the NRC for upgrades providing comparable services. When NRC determines that it is appropriate to upgrade to a newer version of the software, the offeror will manage a complete upgrade of not only the software, but migration of individual user data. As new releases become available, there may also be opportunities for new features to be utilized by the NRC. The offeror shall make recommendations about new feature sets and will work with the NRC to select the best features for the NRC environment. Please see section C.5.1.4.3 Software License Management of this SOW for more information about software license management and upgrades. The offeror shall provide an e-mail encryption solution for the transmission of electronic mail outside of the Agency. This encryption solution must meet all Federal Government and NRC-specific requirements for security. For externally bound e-mail, the offeror shall provide encryption at the e-mail gateway that will be decrypted at the recipient's desktop. For internal e-mail, the offeror shall provide a solution that will utilize existing VeriSign electronic certificates. The offeror shall also supply a mechanism to ensure non-repudiation of emails sent from or to the NRC. C.5.1.3 File and Print

C.5.1.3.1 File Management Information is by far the most significant product that the NRC produces. As a result, the Agency's data files and the ones provided to us by our stakeholders have a great deal of value. Agency users require mechanisms to store and share large volumes of information with each other and their stakeholders. There is also an ever increasing demand to collaborate on electronic files. The core storage consists of file servers at each of the regional offices as well as the NRC Storage Area Networks (SAN). (Two other SANs exist in the data center and are part of the additional tasks). Generally users are allocated two-hundred (200) mega-bytes (MB) of network storage space for files across three mapped drives. Overall, there are more than ten (10) terabytes of storage currently supporting the core tasks, including storage allocated for email. The offeror shall evaluate the current use of storage at the NRC and make recommendations about appropriate per user network file storage allocations. These recommendations will include definitions of distinct user classes which may have different storage allocation requirements. The offeror shall also recommend an appropriate incremental increase in network file storage allocation per user/per year. The offeror shall provide pricing for this incremental storage. All storage services for the core bid shall be proposed utilizing expandable solutions that will scale up cleanly should additional tasks be exercised for the data center support. The data management strategy must align with the Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy articulated in Section C.5.2.2.5 IT Service Continuity (and Backup and Recovery). Data Storage Demand Management - A variety of multi-media requirements have emerged that have increased the demand for shared network storage such as the use of digital images for and video recording of inspections, and the need for video training-on-demand. There is an expectation that the need for shared space will grow each and every year. The offeror shall provide a storage solution that can be seamlessly expanded over time.

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
Data User Class Management - All NRC users do not require the same level of space allocation for Network storage. The offeror shall recommend user storage levels based on roles and responsibilities of the user and an analysis of current storage usage. Access to network storage will be allocated based on user roles. Upon approval of the offeror's recommendations, the offeror shall provide the requested storage volume for each user class and monitor and report on those allocations to ensure network storage needs are met. Data File Availability Management - It is critical that the files stored in both personal and shared network storage are both protected and backed-up so that they can be restored when necessary. The offeror shall back-up data files with appropriate frequency to meet the file restoration service level requirements outlined in Appendix A: SM-SLA-03: File and Print Management. The offeror shall maintain the back-ups for a minimum of four weeks. In addition, as the Agency's users have become increasingly dispersed, more mobile, and are working more flexible work hours, there is a need to access files from anywhere at any time. The offeror shall provide a storage solution that will allow users to access their files from within the ITI and also from remote locations. In addition, the offeror shall provide and operate data management tools with the ability to scan for Personally Identifiable Information (PII). PII is information that can be used to identify or contact a person uniquely and reliably or can be traced back to a specific individual. That is, PII is a person's name, in combination with any of the following information: relatives' names, postal address, email address, home or cellular telephone number, personal characteristics, Social Security number, date or place of birth, mother's maiden name, driver's license number, bank account information, credit card information, or other information that would make the individual's personal identity easily traceable. Note that personal identity is distinct from an individual's professional identity; that is, an employee's name, title, work telephone number, official work location, and work email address are not considered to be PII. Currently the agency retains electronic files indefinitely in shared locations, but is interested in archival solutions to reduce cost for files that have not been used recently. The offeror shall provide a recommendation concerning best practice for archiving and retiring electronic files and if accepted, will assist the NRC in developing a policy for archiving and retiring electronic files after the recommended period of time. C.5.1.3.2 Print Management The offeror shall provide and maintain ability to print electronic documents across the NRC enterprise. The offeror's proposal shall include pricing based on NRC inventory information provided and the offeror's prior experience. Upon award, the offeror shall provide an initial assessment of printer use throughout the Agency and make recommendations for how and what type of printer devices should be used. The offeror shall then make periodic assessments to ensure that an appropriate ratio of printers to users is maintained to meet the Agency's business objectives. In addition, the offeror shall: 1. Provide all hardware and software supporting the file and print services; 2. Implement automation to allow pro-active, remote monitoring of print devices; 3. Implement secure printing, requiring the physical presence of the user at the printer for the print job to continue;

Page 22 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
4. Secure and dispose of all print devices installed with data-bearing drives according to NRC IT security requirements and processes; 5. Maintain print queues; 6. Minimize the amount of time that a user is without access to a given print device (due to either provisioning or repair); 7. Minimize the length and frequency of service outages; and, 8. Minimize the time necessary to provision increased printing capacity when requested by a specific user or when addressing agency-wide requests. Personal Printer Support ­ The offeror shall provide best effort support to local printers that are not provided by the offeror. See section C.3.5 Intent for Mutual Cooperation between Offeror and NRC Staff (Item 4), for more information on best-effort. Upon completion of their initial assessment, the offeror shall recommend which black & white and color printers are most appropriate for the Agency's business requirements. The offeror shall provide specification recommendations to the NRC Project Officer and a determination will be made by the Agency about which recommendations will be accepted. The offeror will be required to work with the NRC Project Officer and the Office of Administration/Division for Space Planning and Consolidation to make final determinations of printer locations as there are constraints based on power and physical space availability. Printers must be supported on a three (3) year refresh cycle by the offeror. Offeror-supplied printers will be capable of printing on 8 ˝ x 11 and 8 ˝ x 14 paper and provide double-sided printing at a minimum. Additionally the offeror shall provide access to printers that are capable of printing 11 x 17 no further than 100 feet from every end-user's on-site workspace. Printer supplies are provided by another (non-ITISS) contractor. To ensure that this nonITISS contractor has time to get supplies in stock, the ITISS offeror shall provide the first 90 days of printer ink/toner cartridges when new models are installed and shall not be required for providing any consumables thereafter. Ninety day supplies shall be calculated as sufficient supplies to handle three times the monthly printing capacity of the printer during normal working hours. C.5.1.3.3 Network Attached Devices Management Additional, approved, government-owned devices (copiers, digital senders, etc.) currently exist in the environment and are likely to continue during all or part of the ITISS period of performance. The offeror shall provide best-effort support for these devices and shall troubleshoot interface issues between the device and the network. Maintenance of copiers is maintained under a separate contract, and the ITISS offeror is not being required to perform general copier maintenance. However, the offeror shall assist the NRC in identifying and/or correcting problems if a user is unable to use an otherwise-functional, networkattached copier for printing or scanning. Digital senders, or other similar devices will be treated the same as personal printers; the offeror shall install these devices and make besteffort attempt at repairs. See section C.3.2 Intent for Mutual Cooperation between Offeror and NRC Staff, Item # 5 for more information on best-effort.

C.5.1.4 Personal Computing and Related Software Licensing

C.5.1.4.1 Personal Computing Personal computing devices are the way in which the vast majority of NRC users gain access to the NRC ITI and all of the services that it provides. Due to the high level of automation at the Agency and the fact that information is at the core of our business, these personal computing devices are also the primary tools used to complete the mission of the Agency. For the purposes of this document, "Personal Computer (PC)" refers to the industry standard terminology for laptops and desktops and similar devices and not to equipment owned personally by NRC employees for their own use. In other words, the PCs referred to in this section are provided by either the offeror or by the NRC for work purposes, not to PCs purchased for home use by NRC users which may remotely access the NRC ITI. PCs will not be purchased by the NRC through this ITISS contract. Different users require different types of PC devices in order to access ITI and other services. Some users are office-bound and a more traditional desktop computing device with a monitor serves their needs. Another group of users spends most of their time traveling, either performing inspections or meeting with global partners. This second group requires a mobile computing solution, but still requires access to many of the services that are available to the office users. Yet another group of users may regularly work in an office, but also works away from the office multiple days a week and requires all of the same services in both locations. Currently, some remote users access ITI services through the NRC's Remote Access System, which is described in more detail in Section C.5.1.6 Remote Access. In addition, The incumbent ISSC contractor currently provisions and maintains an inventory of encrypted MXI Stealth MXP Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives to users to transfer files from one personal computing device to another, including foreign devices. These drives are currently being procured by the NRC through a separate contract. The offeror shall include a proposal to acquire and provide these drives or ones with similar specifications. These personal computing devices provide a way for each NRC user to access all of the Agency's enterprise services. However, especially when considering mobile computing, these devices also pose several risks to the ITI which must be mitigated in order to protect the Agency's data and infrastructure. Secure computing is of significant importance to the Agency and will drive many decisions about the type of computing devices used and how those devices can be implemented into the infrastructure. Security controls must also include protections to prevent unauthorized computing devices connecting to the NRC ITI. Additionally, as a Federal Government entity, the NRC is required to follow specific security directives and legislation (i.e., Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Federal Information Processing Standards, Committee on National Security systems issuances, Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), etc.). Please see section C.5.2.2.6 Information Security Management for additional information on operational IT security requirements. The NRC also recognizes that personal computing evolves over time, causing at least two significant impacts. The first impact is that the cost of existing computing functionality goes down over time. The second impact is that new personal computing functionality is developed over time which can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our users in completing the Agency's mission.

Page 24 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
It is expected that moving forward, the ratio of desktops and laptops will change as the NRC supports a more mobile workforce. For laptops, an option must be provided with a suitable port replicator, external flat-panel monitor, mouse, and keyboard. The total number of mobile computers versus stationary computers used by the NRC will, in part, be dependent on what is proposed by the offeror. Prior to award of the ITISS Contract, the NRC is in the process of standardizing to a common laptop program, managed by the incumbent ISSC contractor. The goal of the program is that all personal computing devices in the agency will be managed through the ITISS contract. All PCs must be supported on a three-year refresh cycle and any new PCs introduced by the offeror during the refresh must be of sufficiently powerful specifications (CPU, random access memory (RAM), hard drive space, etc.) such that they will be viable during their three-year service life, handling typical corporate applications such as Microsoft Outlook mail, productivity applications (e.g. MS Office) as well as typical web-based applications. Multiple classes of computing devices shall be supplied by the offeror, which will support each of the user types discussed in the paragraphs above. These devices should be comparable to above-average computers that are available at the time they are placed into service. Personal computing could encompass a wide range of devices including desktops, laptops, thin clients, smart phones, and future technologies that are not currently available on the market. For portable computing devices, the offeror shall offer multiple form factors to meet differing business uses. Currently, personal computers are provided by the incumbent ISSC contractor through three-year leases. The inventory provided with this SOW provides data on personal computers that are currently in the ITI and when they were last refreshed. The offeror shall include in their proposal provisions for how they will accommodate the transfer of these leases to the ITISS contract or how they intend to absorb the cost of lease termination as a part of their proposed personal computing solution. Users shall have a reasonable approach to: 1. Record data to portable media (compact discs (CDs), digital video discs (DVDs), etc.) 2. Listen to sound (media files, conferencing, etc.) 3. Attach peripheral equipment (USB ports, etc.) 4. Some users (approximately 1000 currently) require dual monitors in order to complete there work effectively and efficiently. 5. Personal printers are currently purchased as GFE in most cases, however some users (approximately 100 currently) shall be provided personal printers. The offeror shall provide full lifecycle management of personal computing assets from procurement, configuration, delivery, maintenance, refresh, and retirement. The NRC reserves the right to select the ultimate software configurations to be provided. Currently, Regional users receive the majority of their IT infrastructure support through Regional NRC IT staff and not the incumbent contractor. Although it is desirable that the Offeror shall provide IT support to all NRC users, this will not be the case when the ITISS contract is initially awarded. The Offeror shall provide separate headquarters and regional

Page 25 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
pricing for each of the recommended personal computing solutions for each year of the contract. In addition, the offeror shall: 1. Provide PC devices, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, thin clients, smart phones, peripherals, and other devices requested by users, approved by the NRC Project Officer, and connected to the NRC network; 2. Manage PC device leasing arrangements with third-party hardware vendors; Maintain license agreements with third-party software vendors; 3. Provide on-site maintenance and replacement for all PC devices managed under the contract; 4. Maintain and manage an inventory of all PC devices (both offeror-supplied and Government furnished) managed under the contract; (Note: There are currently Government furnished PC devices, including such things as laptops and monitors, and it is expected that there will be new Government furnished computing devices that will be purchased during the period of performance for this contract which the offeror shall maintain and inventory) 5. Provide a standard environment for NRC employees through the creation, deployment and maintenance of standard workstation images and standard peripheral configurations; 6. Monitor to ensure conformance to the standard environment and report violations; 7. Provide anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-spam, Trojan, and worm detection and prevention software on personal computers and keep virus signature lists up to date. Copies of anti-virus/anti-malware software will be provided to NRC users for working at home use; 8. Provide firewall for PC devices; 9. Maintain patch levels for PC devices and software (all patches must be tested before deployment); 10. Purge data from decommissioned PC devices; devices will be disposed of in an environmentally sound way and based on the security, sensitivity, and associated NRC computer security policies and guidance; 11. Provide PC refresh on a three-year cycle; 12. Provide a pool of encrypted, loaner laptops configured for NRC mobile use per NRC security policies. When the ITISS contract is awarded, it is expected that there will be 100 loaner laptops at headquarters and 80 in the Regions (mostly Region 1), with rebalancing in the Regions over time from current GFE equipment. Laptops with docking stations will also be provided in place of current desktops which will likely impact the total number of loaner laptops to some extent. Alternative solutions suggested by the offeror for managing remote personal computing resource are welcomed; 13. Provide new PC devices over time as needed based on new business requirements and as technology advances to fulfill existing business requirements;

Page 26 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
14. Provide global support for hardware maintenance and replacement for NRC users who are traveling abroad with NRC computing devices; 15. Minimize the amount of time that a user is without access to a given hardware unit or software (due to provisioning, repair, replacement, distribution of loaner equipment, or moves ­ includes account-related incidents/problems). Note that this objective is valid for both offeror-supplied equipment, and for government-furnished equipment (GFE); 16. Minimize time to resolve software uninstalls, and other software-related issues; and, 17. Minimize the length and frequency of service outages.

C.5.1.4.2 Office Productivity Software Deployment Based on NRC requirements and direction, The offeror shall provide full lifecycle management of office productivity software and other personal computer software to include: procurement, configuration, delivery and retirement. Office Productivity software shall be licensed by the offeror so that NRC users can obtain a copy for installation on a home computer for business use. C.5.1.4.3 Software License Management The offeror shall provide software licenses for office productivity software, and manage the procurement and upgrades to that software. The offeror shall also verify that any software requested to be installed on offeror-supplied PC devices is properly licensed. The offeror shall maintain an inventory of all software installed on offeror-provided PC devices and the associated software license information. The offeror shall report on the use and compliance of all software licenses as requested. The current process (which is expected to continue upon award of this contract) for obtaining and installing user requested software on Agency personal computers is as follows: 1. A user identifies software that they require for meeting a business requirement. 2. The user's manager approves the software purchase. 3. The software is obtained. 4. The user's IT Coordinator makes a formal request to have the software installed. 5. A review is made to determine that the software will not harm the ITI. 6. If approved, the offeror installs the software on the user's workstation. In addition, the offeror shall procure, supply and manage operating system licenses for all personal computing devices, and keep them patched with current patches. The offeror shall also upgrade to current versions when requested by the NRC. The option to upgrade will be available to the NRC (tested against the NRC environment and ready for migration) within six months of release of the upgrade. Once given approval to upgrade the OS or other offeror-supplied software, the offeror shall manage the entire upgrade, including a clear communications plan, training plan, and customer support. It is expected that the offeror will incorporate the cost of these upgrades into their proposals.

Page 27 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
The offeror shall be responsible for ensuring that the software on all offeror-supplied computing devices (desktops, laptops, servers, BlackBerrys etc.) is fully licensed. The offeror shall be financially responsible for any license non-compliance for offeror-supplied software packages. Audits of software licensing will be performed on these devices by an independent verification and validation contractor. The offeror shall bring licenses into compliance for any discrepancies identified in those audits for offeror-supplied software packages. C.5.1.4.4 Personal Computer Risk Management The offeror shall manage personal computer risk environment through virus and malware scanning. In addition, the offeror shall: 1. Provide up-to-date patching for operating systems and productivity software; 2. Provide support of Card Readers for logical (and not physical) access to personal computers in support of HSPD-12; 3. Provide a solution for recovery of lost or stolen hardware (such as Computrace LoJack) to recover equipment that is missing from inventory; and, 4. Provide encryption for data at rest on personal computing devices. C.5.1.5 Network Components Disruptions in the network infrastructure are costly, therefore reliable and manageable network components are expected to ensure that enterprise services are available when they are required. Requirements for training through video-on-demand, virtual meetings, and other media-rich collaborations to reduce travel costs and increase productivity also increase the demands on the network infrastructure. All network support functions are to be provided 24 x 7 x 365, including holidays. Unlike other tasks in the core services section, the network monitoring and asset management tasks require the complete and unified management of all offeror-supplied and Government-furnished assets attached to the network, including those initially managed under existing contracts outside of the scope of the core ITISS contract. The offeror shall clearly describe how such complete and unified management would be achieved through coordination with other on-site vendors. This shall include the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC). See section C.5.2.3.3 Service Asset and Configuration Management of this SOW to obtain a greater understanding of the NRC's requirements related to asset management. The offeror shall propose a refresh cycle for the components which make up the network backbone. The network backbone consists of all "network devices." There are many components of the existing NRC ITI which straddle the worlds of networking and system administration. For the purposes of this document, network devices includes: hubs, switches, routers, firewalls, network filters, load balancers, network accelerators, and devices introduced in the future that are required to manage the NRC ITI. The offeror shall be responsible for maintaining and patching these devices and all of the software running on these devices. This proposal shall ensure that all of the components are maintained at all times and provide adequate network support. The offeror shall include pricing which is consistent with this network backbone refresh approach.

Evaluate trends to determine opportunities for improved performance, provide recommendations for improvements, and implement those changes as requested by the NRC; 10. Monitor for changes to security configurations, service pack applications, etc. that could have security implications and report them to the security group for investigation (See section C.5.2.2.6 Information Security Management for additional requirements related to security monitoring and incident response); 11. Provide capacity and performance monitoring and trending reports on all the infrastructure components, and monitor traffic on the Agency non-secured data networks; 12. Ensure that all network events are recorded and filtered, and that the appropriate staff members are notified of the event; 13. Minimize the length and frequency of service outages; 14. Minimize the time necessary to provision increased network bandwidth upon request; and, 15. Minimize the time between a change in ITI status and notification of appropriate NRC personnel. C.5.1.6 Remote Access Currently, remote users can access specific application resources from their home computers through a Citrix gateway. Going forward, the NRC anticipates an environment in which remote computing will be achieved through a combination of the current Citrix gateway and NRC-controlled laptops tunneling into the network securely. The remote computer shall employ a suitable standalone/personal firewall installed that supports NRC connection policies. There shall be a mechanism for a minimum critical update level and an associated quarantine area where systems are patched before permitting connectivity. Third-party products are available which can automatically update computers to ensure compliance with a defined security policy even when not connected to the NRC network and should be considered.

Page 32 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
The connection between the remote computer and the NRC network must be made through a secure, encrypted Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel. The tunnel must be consistent with Federal IT security policy. The VPN shall be configured to require a hardware authenticator (i.e. a hardware "token") which generates a unique key on a timed schedule (approximately every sixty seconds). The remote computer user must enter the generated key along with their password to gain access to the encrypted VPN tunnel. Split-tunneling, which allows users to access both corporate and local resources simultaneously (such as using the VPN to access the NRC network and in parallel using home-office resources such as local internet access) will not be allowed. By tunneling all internet access through the NRC firewall, security standards related to internet access will be enforced. Access to some applications is also provided through Citrix to both NRC-owned and homeowned computers. The offeror will not be required to physically visit or maintain homeowned computers, but will be required for providing email and telephone support to allow users working from home computers to access Citrix-based applications. In addition, the offeror shall: 1. Minimize the amount of time that a user is without access to remote connectivity (due to either provisioning or repair); and, 2. Minimize the length and frequency of service outages. C.5.1.7 Integration IT Services are continually evaluated and updated at the NRC. New services can be generated by customer requirements and modifications to existing services can occur through continual service improvement. The offeror shall work with the NRC to introduce changes to the ITI and manage them for the remainder of the contract. Integration does not include regular patching and updates and shall be provided by the offeror and included in the pricing of the personal computing, network component or server administration unit costs. C.5.1.7.1 Project Management As an Agency largely made up of engineers and scientists, it is vital that up to date IT services are provided to the users to attract and retain the talent we need to accomplish our mission. Designing and implementing new technologies requires thorough project management discipline. The NRC uses its own Project Management Methodology (PMM ­ see MD 2.8 http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/managementdirectives/volumes/vol-2.html). The offeror shall use the NRC PMM for projects performed throughout the life of this contract. In addition the offeror shall: 1. Track project status using NRC Enterprise Project Management (Microsoft Project Enterprise); 2. Follow a proven and documented standard systems Change Management methodology, approved by the NRC for all changes to be made to the NRC ITI; 3. Attend regular NRC meetings to review project schedules, status and resource allocations;

Implement and coordinate the use of NRC Project Management Methodology (PMM) for all IT infrastructure programs and efforts; 6. Minimize time between when a given project update occurs, and the time in which their status in MS Projects is updated; and, 7. Minimize the discrepancy between the milestones defined in MS projects, and the actual delivery of these project milestones. C.5.1.7.2 Research Emerging technologies being implemented into existing infrastructure environments requires extensive and thorough research development and testing. The offeror shall perform as the IT systems engineer for the NRC ITI and will provide recommendations, planning, coordination, design and engineering for the IT infrastructure as required for current and future NRC programs, systems, and services. In addition the offeror shall: 1. Be responsible for providing assessments of the IT infrastructure and making recommendations for new and enhanced systems; 2.

Network tomography is the study of a network's internal characteristics using information derived from end point data. The word tomography is used to link the field, in concept, to other processes that infer the internal characteristics of an object from external observation, as is done in magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography (even though the term tomography strictly refers to imaging by slicing). The field is a recent development in electrical engineering and computer science, founded in 1996. Network tomography advocates believe that it is possible to map the path data takes through the Internet by examining information from "edge nodes," the computers where data is originated and requested from. - Yardi, Y. (1996). "Network Tomography: estimating source-destination traffic intensities from link data". J. Am. Statistics Association 91: 365­377.

C.5.2.2.6 Information Security Management C.5.2.2.6.1 NRC Responsibilities At the core of the Agency's mission is to ensure the safe and secure handling of radioactive materials. Since its creation, the NRC has always sought to appropriately protect its information resources. The increase in computerization has caused the majority of that information to exist in electronic form as data records and files. The sophistication and frequency of malicious activity targeting the Agency has also increased. These forces combined with the need for Agency users to stay connected with our stakeholders and partners through the Internet pose a significant risk to the Agency if left unmitigated. A thorough, aggressive strategy must be instituted to protect the Agency's information resources. It is expected that this strategy will need to be adjusted and enhanced over time as the sophistication of malicious activity increases. The NRC is ultimately responsible for Information Security Management, but the offeror will play a vital role in helping to achieve the NRC's goals described in the next section C.5.2.2.6.2. C.5.2.2.6.2 Offeror Responsibilities IT Security Program Management The offeror shall advise on, deliver and manage a wide-ranging IT security program to prevent, detect, and respond to IT security incidents.

Secure and unsecure assets shall be combined in the CMDB. The NRC recognizes that there is a great deal of complexity associated with this task. The agency seeks an offeror that has proven experience in developing and maintaining a comprehensive Configuration Management (CM) strategy. The NRC is focused more on the quality of the CM approach than on how rapidly it can be implemented. The offeror shall provide, configure, populate, and manage a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) providing the foundation for many services and IT support processes associated with this contract. The CMDB will, at a minimum, identify all assets supporting NRC services with an appropriate level of starting detail. Initial detail shall include, at a minimum, unique identifiers, location, and description of the hardware or software with appropriate level of completeness. Appropriate linkages between key components and services need to be identified and implemented by the offeror. The offeror shall establish and enforce standard configurations (and images) that fulfill the business needs of NRC personnel and conform to security policies while recognizing that the workforce of the future expects a certain minimum level of technological sophistication. Verification and reporting shall be enforced by the offeror - automated discovery tools are quite mature and shall be utilized by the offeror to generate and ensure the accuracy of the basic asset list. The offeror shall utilize discovery tools to scan desktops weekly and report unapproved software on a monthly basis. The offeror shall provide a simple, cost effective process by which legitimate software can be considered for the approved list.

Upon award of the ITISS contract, the offeror will describe a Release and Deployment Management approach that is substantially in alignment with the processes and procedures described in Section 4.4 of the ITIL v3 Service Transition publication. The offeror shall provide and manage appropriate tools to manage the overall transition process. C.5.2.3.5 Knowledge Management C.5.2.3.5.1 NRC Responsibilities The NRC is responsible for furnishing existing knowledge to the offeror in bulk at the beginning of the contract and as requested thereafter. The NRC is also responsible for attending quarterly meetings led by the offeror to analyze data, synthesize information based on that data, identify any knowledge gaps that exist, and help to fill those gaps. Furthermore, the NRC is responsible for identifying rules concerning what functional roles should have access to what knowledge. C.5.2.3.5.2 Offeror Responsibilities The offeror shall provide and maintain a document repository accessible by all support staff and select NRC staff of processes, procedures, and technical manuals. A subset of information shall be available for users to search and resolve minor incidents. In addition to this document repository, there is a need for a knowledge management and dissemination approach that balances reasonability and ease of maintenance with the obvious benefits of having the right training, communications, and historical knowledge in the hands of offeror and NRC staff when they are needed. The NRC is aware that over-engineered Knowledge Management efforts frequently sacrifice the "good enough" to the quest for perfection and can become costly failures as a result. Vendors shall suggest reasonable knowledge management processes, procedures, and technologies that have been proven to work at other clients. Information already included in the service desk description need not be repeated in response to this section. The offeror will be responsible for maintaining the original versions of documents.

In addition, the offeror shall maximize the availability of the document repository (containing processes, procedures, technical manuals, and other relevant documentation in support of NRC services) C.5.2.4 Service Operation Service Operation is the business of achieving the delivery of agreed levels of services both to end-users and the customers (where "customers" refer to those individuals who pay for the service and negotiate Service Level Agreements (SLAs)). Service Operation is the part of the lifecycle where the services and value are directly delivered. Service Operation also includes monitoring problems and considers the balance between service reliability and cost. Topics include balancing conflicting goals (e.g. reliability vs. cost, etc.). This section also includes a discussion of the service desk Function, which spans a great deal of the Service Operation topics. C.5.2.4.1 The Service Desk Function The current service desk implementation includes multiple service desks at headquarters (Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System - ADAMS, Time and Labor, Enterprise Project Management - EPM, etc.) as well as Local service desks within the regions. There is also not a central shared ticketing system, although Magic (now a BMC tool) is utilized by some desks. The user experience today is primarily as follows: ˇ ˇ The user dials "1234" on their telephone and reaches an automated voice system asking if their topic is ADAMS, HRMS, EPM, etc.; Once the user selects their choice, a recorded message concerning any known problems is played if appropriate. The user is then put through to support personnel who begin a ticket; If the user unwittingly picked the wrong choice, they are transferred to another individual; If the Help Desk Level 1 support cannot answer the question, the user's ticket is recorded and forwarded to Level 2 support for resolution; and, Escalation is not always done according to crisp rules.

ˇ ˇ ˇ

In general, service desk support utilizes a modified 15 x 7 dedicated support plus on-call hours of operation model, with 15 x 5 Monday through Friday and 12 x 2 on weekends. All other hours are on call for Chairman and Commission staff (approximately 40 users). A predominant number of the Local service desk staff are budgeted by, and paid for by the regions and are not managed by or coordinated through the Centralized service desk. IT Coordinators serve as the liaisons between each NRC Office and the Network Operations and Customer Service Branch (NOCSB). IT Coordinators must approve requests for network access and access to server-based applications, remote access, software installation, moves or removals of desktops, software or peripherals acquisitions, and desktop upgrades. IT Coordinator responsibilities include: 1. Email and coordinate user requests to the Customer Support Team; 2. Approve and submit Electronic Move Requests for all microcomputer equipment moves and network account moves;

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
3. In some cases, procure non-infrastructure hardware and software using the NRC Bankcard program if a Bankcard holder; 4. Communicate changes in IT Coordinator personnel to the Office of Information Services; 5. Attend OIS briefings on IT issues Serve as Office liaison between office staff and the OIS to coordinate Agency-wide software upgrades; and, 6. Inform the OIS about any changes to the office computing environment. To the extent possible, the NRC would like to consolidate service desk functions at headquarters into a single centralized service desk with shared ticketing, procedures, and specialized support at Tier 2 (one of the service desks is currently outsourced to a thirdparty vendor and may not lend itself to consolidation). The NRC wishes to share resources, tools, and procedures between the Central and Regional service desks. Because of the sensitive nature of some of the information handled by the NRC, off-shoring this function is not a viable solution. There is not a requirement for service desk staff to be co-located with NRC staff beyond the need to maintain sufficient staff at local sites for providing deskside support. Local staff may report to and be dispatched by the centralized service desk. If the offeror proposes an off-site Help Desk, they must also propose a viable, federally-approved, secure mechanism for remote access to user workstations for providing support. The offeror shall balance the staff skills and levels of staffing to address the service level requirements found in Appendix A: SM-SLA-11: Service Desk. The offeror shall manage and enforce policies and procedures across all service desk staff. Dedicated offeror staff shall be available business weekdays 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., weekends 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. EST, and on-call services available at all other times, including all holidays. Procedures and tools shall be established by the offeror to increase resolution of incidents and fulfillment of request at Level 1. The offeror shall collect, review, and provide metrics to validate appropriate staffing levels and adjust as needed. Procedures and SLRs for on-call response times need to be documented by the offeror and agreed upon by the NRC, including "special circumstances processes" to invoke immediate response when required. Clear communications of current known incidents and known problems and workarounds shall also be provided by the offeror. A knowledge database with "known fixes" shall be implemented by the offeror. The offeror shall make self-help tools, including password reset, available to NRC users. It is essential that these self-help tools address all NRC and Federal security policy. The offeror shall provide standard industry software to accept, manage, and resolve user incidents. The offeror shall provide access to this software to appropriate NRC staff members. The tool shall have the capability to provide self-service submission of incidents as well as the ability for the user to check status on any open ticket. Technology should be leveraged to allow service desk staff to take control of a remote computer to troubleshoot/repair issues. The offeror shall recommend an approach for NRC approval in each of the following areas: 1. Three-tier incident severity ratings shall be established with clear criteria; 2. Escalation procedures and criteria shall be established; 3. Training programs for new service desk personnel shall be described; and

Page 64 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
4. Knowledge Base for continuous improvement shall be established. The offeror shall describe a cost-effective approach to providing an integrated, highlyeffective service desk function that receives acceptable customer service ratings. The offeror shall provide real examples from existing customers including customer service ratings and customer contact information. In addition, the offeror shall: 1. Report all verified or suspected computer security and/or unauthorized PII release incidents immediately to the NRC CSIRT; 2. Minimize the time from when a phone call enters the Service Desk queue to when a live agent takes the call and works with the user; 3. Maximize the number of calls/contacts that are reasonably resolved upon "first contact" (i.e. resolved without warranting additional calls to the Service Desk) 4. Minimize the number of Service Desk calls that are disconnected (abandoned) before reaching a live agent; 5. Minimize the time in which a user is on hold, prior to either reaching a live agent or abandonment; 6. Minimize the percentage of tickets that need to be reopened to complete resolution; 7. Minimize the time from when an e-mailed request for assistance is sent to when the service desk responds to the request; 8. Minimize the time from when request for assistance is sent through the web portal to when the service desk responds to the request; 9. Maximize the number of incidents that are correctly escalated; 10. Maximize the availability of live agents and of customer-facing applications (e.g. Customer Service Portal); and, 11. Maximize customer satisfaction.

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
C.5.2.4.7 Other Service Operation Considerations The NRC regularly adds and changes technologies in the NRC ITI. However, as existing IT services are vital to the day-to-day productivity of NRC users, it is essential that the introduction of these changes does not disrupt normal Agency operations. Therefore, all modifications to the NRC ITI must be thoroughly tested in the Agency's test environment and appropriate precautions must be taken to mitigate any disruptions that they might introduce. This test environment must appropriately replicate the actual production environment so that the tests can be as accurate as possible and real problems can be identified and corrected. Although individual IT system owners must take the responsibility to move their systems through this process, the offeror shall help them to succeed in this endeavor. The offeror shall propose a risk management approach that includes a set of Key Risk Indicators and a risk management and measurement plan. Examples of Key Risk Indicators might include (the NRC is providing these as examples, not guidance or requirement): ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Turnover rate of personnel managing critical systems Critical system downtime due to environmental disruption Critical system downtime due to IT security breaches Critical system downtime due to IT change Number of planned IT changes at different levels of severity Time between gap closures Risk of maintaining the status quo

The offeror shall also perform all database activities described in the additional task in Section C.6.3.4.2 Database Support for all databases related to the core and any additional services. C.5.2.5 Continual Service Improvement (CSI) All NRC employees require timely, reliable, and accurate information in order to make decisions. Shared information about the NRC ITI, ongoing project schedules, security incidents, emerging trends, external suppliers, incident status, and accomplishments help to build trust and allow for a shared ownership in successes and failures alike. In addition to the reporting described below, the offeror and the NRC will meet quarterly to review at least one new area selected by the NRC for Service Improvement to develop a plan for improvement and to review results in ongoing improvement plans. The NRC will agree with the offeror on the area for improvement no later than the third week of the quarter. The offeror shall review solutions and improvements that they have implemented for other customers and make recommendations for how similar improvements could be made at the NRC. If approved by the NRC, the offeror shall implement these improvements. Vendors are free to propose other programs for Continual Service Improvement (CSI).

Emergency Response Data System (ERDS) Operations and Maintenance

This section describes the specific requirements, using the NRC ITISS contract vehicle, for operations and maintenance of the Emergency Response Data System (ERDS) solution to authorized NRC Headquarters and regional users and evaluates external access policies and procedures for access by Federal, State and local agencies, and Licensees. C.6.8.1 General The Emergency Response Data System is one of the Information Technology (IT) systems that are used in the Operations Center after a nuclear emergency is declared at a U.S. nuclear plant. The system is Federally Regulated through 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50.72.A.4, which states that the licensee must activate ERDS within one hour after the licensee declares an emergency at an emergency class level of "alert" or higher (higher means the declaration of a "site area emergency" or "general emergency"), and it is a system that is designed to collect nuclear plant performance and environmental data for analysis by NRC and State emergency response personnel. ERDS is also used in the HOC at times when the NRC and licensee participate in planned drills. ERDS is currently implemented at NRC Headquarters (HQ), the four (4) NRC Regions, the NRC Technical Training Center (TTC) and is used over the web by twenty-two (22) States who qualified to use ERDS because their State boundary falls within the 10-mile Emergency Protective Zone (EPZ) of a specific plant or group of plants and they have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the NRC. Additionally, NRC modems are installed at every operating nuclear power plant in the country (65 plants, 104 units) so that the required ERDS data can be transmitted. During declared emergencies and planned drills, the ERDS receives an automated feed of digital data from nuclear power plant operators over long distance analog telephone circuits. The type of information sent by the nuclear power plant allows the NRC to assess the overall adequacy of licensee actions, provide recommendations for mitigating accident consequences and to protect the public. Data such as system temperatures, pressures, water levels, flows, radiation levels, wind speed and direction are all transmitted by the plants. The offeror shall maintain continuous availability of key personnel who are required to successfully perform the work required in this statement of work. The offeror shall ensure that both key and backup personnel are committed in performing these services during the NRC's official hours of operation and shall provide a minimum one (1) hour response to any NRC calls during all other times.

Microsoft SharePoint Support

The NRC SharePoint program structure consists of several components designed to support the SharePoint technical environment, extend SharePoint to serve business needs, and educate and support users so that they can leverage SharePoint features. A few of these components that are integral to the success of this task include: SharePoint Program Management ­ is responsible for developing and implementing the SharePoint vision using the resources available to the program and for compliance with applicable IT/IM/information security regulations and requirements. The SharePoint vision supports and complements the ECM program vision. The NRC SharePoint Manager for this contract is part of the SharePoint Program Management. Project Teams ­ are temporary, integrated teams responsible for rolling out SharePoint and for delivering a unique SharePoint product or service. Project teams are lead by NRC project managers using the NRC Project Management Methodology (PMM) and the SharePoint extensions to manage the project. SharePoint Administrators ­ a permanent team serving as a forum for knowledge exchange between Primary SharePoint Site Administrators. Initially, the team will consist of Office level Primary Site Administrators, but will expand to division-level Primary SharePoint Site Administrators over time. The NRC end user will first contact their respective SharePoint Administrator for support. If their SharePoint Administrator is unavailable or is unable to adequately address the end user's need, the end user will then call the Tier I Help Desk for support. The offeror shall provide NRC Microsoft SharePoint end users with Tier I Help Desk support. At a minimum, the offeror shall: 1. Provide Tier I Help Desk support to NRC MS SharePoint end users on the 18 out-ofthe-box features. 2. Utilize the NRC service desk tracking system (provided under the Core task) to track requests and ensure that all requests for service and problems are responded to in a timely manner and properly closed out in the tracking system when completed. 3. Address end user questions concerning the features, functions, and operation of MS SharePoint. The offeror shall make a first attempt to resolve the end user's SharePoint problem directly over the phone. The Help Desk staff member shall apply remote Service diagnostics to try to resolve the request directly if possible. If not, the request will be dispatched for face-to-face resolution. 4. Develop and maintain MS SharePoint Help Desk support policies, procedures, and practices as needed. 5. Develop and maintain MS SharePoint training guides and support materials as needed. 6. Track and maintain Help Desk metrics for inclusion in the Help Desk Metrics Report. The NRC SharePoint Manager and the offeror shall agree on the type of metrics to include in the report.

The deliverables shall be submitted to the NRC SharePoint Manager on or before the scheduled due date; completely address the NRC's requirements; be free of formatting and spelling errors; be clearly written; and have no incomplete sections. As each deliverable is usually the end result of a series of activities, prior to starting on each task, it is vital that the offeror and the NRC agree on the approach for the deliverable, the activities involved to develop it, and expectations for the final product. C.6.11.2 Ad-Hoc Meetings The offeror shall be available to attend Ad-Hoc meetings in person requested by the NRC SharePoint Manager. The offeror will be given 24 hours notice before an Ad-Hoc Meeting will be convened. C.6.12 Extraordinary Move Support From 2013 ­ 2015, the NRC will centralize all headquarters staff not currently located in One White Flint North or Two White Flint North into a new building in Rockville, Maryland. The NRC anticipates 1500 staff moves in 2013, and 6000 extra staff moves in each of 2014 and 2015 to achieve the consolidation (some people will be moved more than once). These moves are in addition to the current average annual moves of 1000. The offeror shall bid two separate additional tasks to support the extraordinary moves. In the first task, the offeror will support the approximate 1500 moves to the planned building located adjacent to the main headquarters building at 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville from the current four headquarters buildings at 6003 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, MD; 7201 Wisconsin Ave, Bethesda, MD; 12300 Twinbrook Parkway, Rockville, MD; and 21 Church Street, Rockville. The offeror shall move all computer equipment (including GFE equipment) within a short time frame (4-8 weeks). These moves could occur as early as 2012.

TRANSITION CONSIDERATIONS
Initial Transition

Within their bid, the offeror shall provide a detailed schedule for how they intend to assume management of the NRC ITI, including: 1. providing adequate security cleared staff 2. transfer and/or procurement of ITI components 3. management tools (software, etc.) procurement, installation, and training 4. transfer of ongoing integration projects from the incumbent ISSC contractor The current environment is a mix of assets leased by the incumbent ISSC contractor, assets owned by the incumbent ISSC contractor, and assets owned by the Government. The majority of the assets in the core tasks are leased by the incumbent ISSC contractor. The incumbent ISSC contractor estimates that they own 1/3 and lease 2/3 of all equipment provided to the NRC under their contract. Further, the incumbent ISSC contractor values the 1/3 of owned equipment between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000. The incumbent ISSC contractor will, upon award of the ITISS contract, provide a report of all assets that make up the ITI, designating if they are leased or owned. The offeror will perform a physical inventory and inventory valuation within sixty (60) days of Contract award. It is anticipated that the new Contract and the current Contract will overlap for 180 days. The offeror will use the first 90 days of this period to prepare for the transition (inventory, hiring, security clearances, etc.) and the remaining 90 days will be to transition infrastructure services from the incumbent ISSC contractor. Two equipment leases will extend into the initial year of the base period for the ITISS contract. One additional lease will extend several years into the base period of the ITISS contract (see Table 4 ­ Existing Equipment Leases That Extend into ITISS Contract Base Period, below).

* The precise quantity of laptop computers was unknown at the time of RFP release, so approximations are provided  Table 4 ­ Existing Equipment Leases That Extend into ITISS Contract Base Period

The Offeror shall choose one of two options in how to manage these existing leases: 1. The Offeror can negotiate and assume these leases with the hardware leasing company and

Page 129 of 217

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
complete the term of each lease; or, 2. The Offeror can terminate these leases and absorb the termination cost in their proposal cost. The incumbent ISSC contractor may still be utilizing other leased equipment at the time of ITISS contract transition. The Offeror will also have the option of transferring these leases as well. These leases will be for beyond the current 36-month term of the original lease. Upon award of the ITISS contract, the offeror will select the assets to be purchased from the incumbent ISSC contractor. For the valuation of owned assets being transferred from the incumbent ISSC contractor to the offeror, a formula has been established. This formula takes into account the age of the equipment and the Government's monthly cost. Upon legal transfer of the assets from the incumbent ISSC Contractor to the offeror (no more than 90 days after notice to proceed with the new ITISS contract), the incumbent ISSC Contractor's responsibility for ITISS services shall terminate. All incumbent existing assets should be less than three (3) years old unless the asset has a demonstrable ongoing life or the life has been extended at the request of the NRC. The offeror shall be responsible for all costs associated with providing, maintaining, and operating the NRC ITI. All costs of inventory and transfer will be the responsibility of the offeror. C.7.2 Other Transition Considerations The NRC will, at all times, retain the ownership of any data provided by the Government to the offeror during the period of performance of the ITISS Contract. At the expiration of the contract and at any point during the contract, the offeror shall provide the NRC with all data in an easily portable format that maintains any relational information. C.7.3 Transfer of End User Assets to a Successor Offeror or the Government The offeror will propose an asset transfer plan to be enacted at the end of the ITISS contract. The offeror's proposed Transition-out Asset Transfer approach shall specify the transfer of assets back to the Government or successor offeror using a comparable wholesale market value basis upon termination or expiration of the Contract and transfer of leases on leased equipment as requested. The plan will state that the successor offeror will have the option to select assets for transfer. Upon expiration of the ITISS contract, the offeror shall transfer ownership of all installed hardware, software, maintenance agreements, operational data (including CMDB data, incident data, and known error/knowledge data), and associated documentation to the Government or successor offeror. This transfer shall be accomplished in accordance with terms and conditions mutually agreed to upon award, and utilizing an independent third party valuation. In no case shall the asset transfer cost exceed the current wholesale market value of the installed assets as established by an independent third party. All leased or owned assets that are not selected for transfer will be the responsibility of the offeror. Under no circumstances will the NRC or the successor offeror be liable for any leases extending beyond the end of the contract, or for disposal of the assets.

Appendix A: Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
A.1. INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is designed to support the Information Technology Infrastructure Services and Support (ITISS) contract by providing the principles associated with award surveillance. The purpose of this plan is to recognize the responsibility of the offeror to carry out its quality obligations and provide measurable inspection and acceptance criteria corresponding to the quality of the offeror's performance of the standards detailed in the statement of work. This QASP shall focus on the level of performance required by the statement of work, rather than the methodology used by the offeror to achieve that level of performance. Furthermore, this QASP will be used as a government document to enforce the inspection and acceptance clauses stated in the ITISS Statement of Work (SOW). Note that several of the Service Level Requirements (SLRs) that are associated with core tasks (as described in C.5.1 Basic Infrastructure Support Services) also apply to additional services (as described in C.6 Additional Services). For example, the "Availability of Service (Availability)" SLR, as listed in Section A.4.5, is relevant to the entire NRC data network and is not specific to those portions of the network that affect core services. As such, all SLRs for the basic infrastructure support services apply to additional services, as they are awarded.

A.2.

SURVEILLANCE

Depending of the specific sub-task, the NRC staff members that are responsible for ITISS quality assurance (such NRC staff members are hereafter collectively referred to as "the QAs") may inspect task performance via the following methods: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Reviewing logs generated from automated Performance Monitoring Reviewing automatically generated statistics Reviewing records/reports Reviewing user input/feedback Watching actual performance and/or direct interaction with offeror's staff/management

In all cases, surveillance shall not be so intrusive as to impact the offeror's successful accomplishment of the responsibilities associated with each ITISS subtask. Surveillance observations/inspections made by the QAs will be recorded weekly, and reported monthly, in order to track the offeror's performance. These monthly reports become an official NRC record of the offeror's performance. When surveillance detects unacceptable service, the offeror shall be notified. In such cases, the deficiency will be considered to be sub-par performance, and will be documented as such.

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work

A.3.

UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE

Performance for a given ITISS subtask is deemed unacceptable for a given month if the offeror fails to meet the required performance level for any Service Level Requirement (SLR) associated with that subtask (detailed in Section A.4 of this document). The QAs will monitor the degree to which the offeror meets each SLR per the surveillance methods outlined in Sections A.2 and A.4 of this document. When this surveillance detects unacceptable adherence to any of the SLRs, the offeror shall be notified, and the deficiency will be documented. A financial disincentive will be used to compensate the NRC for the loss in productivity caused by performance below the required Service Level. The payment for every invoice will be reduced by the Disincentive Fee (5% or a greater value proposed by the offeror), regardless of offeror performance. At the end of every contract quarter 2 , the NRC Contract Officer (CO) and NRC Project Officer (PO) will meet to evaluate the documented SLR deficiencies for that quarter and assess appropriate damages for each deficiency. Payment of the withheld Disincentive Fee, reduced by the total damages assessed, will then be provided to the offeror.

2

The periodicity of this evaluation may be renegotiated after base year 1 of the contract.

Appendix E: Reporting Requirements
THIS SECTION SUMMARIZES THE OVERALL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REQUIRED ACROSS ALL ITISS TASKS. AS SUCH, THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION ARE INTENTIONALLY REDUNDANT WITH THOSE DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT SECTION C OF THIS DOCUMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS "ADDITIONAL" REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The offeror shall recommend to the NRC the appropriate media for these reports to be provided. In general, the NRC would like to have electronic versions of the reports that can be accessed at any time by a wide variety of potential users. Ideally, many of these reports will be dynamic and will provide summary information and allow a reviewer of the report to "drill down" into the report to obtain additional data on a specific area within the summary. This will allow both executives and contract monitors to be able to identify information to assist in the overall management of the contract. A variety of reporting will be required for all of the different service areas. Some specific service area reporting is listed below. Most reports are required on a set frequency such as the Monthly technical status report; however the frequency of many of the reporting requirements will be identified later. Throughout the life of the contract reporting requirements may change based on changes in the services. The intent of this list of reports is to identify more specifically the information that must be included in the reports. There are 7 general types of reporting for the ITISS contract: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Daily Weekly Bi-Weekly Monthly Quarterly Ad Hoc Situational

For most service areas daily reports will be required and will consist of issues or items of interests that have occurred in the past 24 hours. Daily reporting will also include current or resolved outages in the past 24 hours, the services impacted, and the resolution for the outage. It shall also include any scheduled maintenance or major changes to the infrastructure or services in the past 24 hours or the upcoming 48 hours. Pricing associated with reporting requirements should be included in the offeror's Price Schedule for each projected delivery period under the "Management Services" service type for each sub-task that the specific reporting is associated with.

1. Executive Summary
The IT Roadmap provides a vision and summary-level plan for establishing the information technology (IT) tools and systems to meet the needs of the NRC staff and external stakeholders over the next three plus years. In alignment with agency strategic plans, the IT Roadmap provides information to agency offices and IT staff regarding current and planned capabilities related to the business needs most important to the agency, and how these needs are or will be met through current and planned enhancements to productivity tools, applications, and the underlying NRC IT infrastructure. This revision of the IT Roadmap was developed with an emphasis on the five major IT Themes from the 2008 IPT Report and 2009 IT Summit, and incorporates the contributions of crossagency working groups with representatives from the various NRC Offices and Regions. As summarized in Table 1 below, for each theme the IT Roadmap outlines the business challenges, business needs, strategies and solution sets to meet those needs, and the value the NRC might achieve through addressing the business challenges and needs. IT Roadmap Themes
Working from Anywhere NRC employees will increasingly perform work remotely such as at home, inspection sites, or different NRC buildings, and while on travel. Working with Anyone With a dispersed and mobile workforce, newer strategies are needed to bring employees together to collaborate and share ideas. Universal Access Users can securely gain access to the IT systems and information they need through a single or minimal points of entry. Easy Information Retrieval Once connected to the NRC network, employees should easily find the information they need to do their jobs effectively.

2. Introduction
2.1 Purpose and Goal
The IT Roadmap provides a vision and summary-level plan for establishing the information technology (IT) tools and systems to meet the needs of the NRC staff and external stakeholders over the next three plus years. This document supports the overall strategic direction described in the NRC Strategic Plan and IT / Information Management (IT / IM) Strategic Plan, and is designed to help guide IT planning activities across the agency. The IT Roadmap provides information to agency offices and IT staff regarding current and planned capabilities related to the business needs important to the agency, and how these needs are or will be met through current and planned enhancements to productivity tools, applications, and the underlying NRC IT infrastructure. The goal of the IT Roadmap is to enable greater levels of business efficiency and use of common IT solutions, support collaboration and information transparency, and promote more effective use of agency IT assets, resources, and investments.

2.2 Background
In the spring of 2008, the Executive Director of Operations (EDO) led a group of senior managers in a team assessment of whether the NRC's support infrastructure was sufficiently flexible and adaptable to meet future program requirements. Many IT improvements were recommended to the EDO in the resulting Infrastructure Planning Team (IPT) Report (ML081090327). These recommendations were organized into five business-oriented IT themes, which reflect the capabilities and technology areas most important to the agency: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Working from Anywhere Working with Anyone Universal Access Easy Information Retrieval Business Enablers

Following this effort, the Office of Information Systems (OIS) built on the IPT's work by refining the associated business needs and identifying the most important initiatives that would directly support the NRC's mission. In 2009, OIS hosted a day-long IT Summit to engage in discussions with offices and regions to foster a better understanding of the agency's IT program and to increase awareness of the crucial planning activities needed to properly execute IT projects. During the summit, the five business-oriented IT themes were discussed and prioritized by the offices. Based on the prioritized IT themes, OIS developed an action plan to address feedback gathered and engaged program and regional offices to define and validate the NRC's technology-related business needs, strategies and solution sets, as well as target timeframes for implementation. The IT Roadmap summarizes the results of these agency-wide planning activities and serves as the primary means for communicating the vision and IT direction of the NRC.

2.3 Organization of the Document
This revision of the IT Roadmap was developed with emphasis on the five major IT Themes from the IPT Report and IT Summit, and incorporates the contributions of cross-agency working groups with representatives from the various NRC Offices and Regions. The document is organized by themes to help focus and align planning efforts, improve IT communication, and more effectively address common business needs within the NRC. As illustrated in Figure 1, the IT Investment Pyramid shows how this planning translates business challenges into business needs, strategies and solution sets to meet those needs, as well as the value the NRC might achieve through addressing the business challenges and needs. The IT Investment Pyramid represents the organization of information documented in the IT Roadmap, which can then further support additional planning efforts that drive project investments, scheduling, contracts, and other details, as maintained separately by the relevant project teams. Section 3 within this document details each IT Theme and is aligned to the layers within the IT Investment Pyramid as follows:

2.4 How to Use the IT Roadmap
The IT Roadmap, in conjunction with Enterprise Architecture (EA) guidance, standards, and frameworks for IT investments, should be used by office and regional stakeholders for IT investment planning to help align technology investments and decisions to the strategic agency IT themes. As a communication and planning tool, the IT Roadmap provides information about common technology solutions, describes a standard set of considerations for IT investment owners to follow, and outlines dependencies and planned implementation sequencing between technology initiatives.

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
2009 The NRC IT Roadmap

Version 1.0

Offices that conform with the NRC's EA guidance and the strategies and plans outlined in the IT Roadmap can take advantage of agency-wide IT efforts and shorten business case preparation and approval for IT investments, as well as reduce solution delivery timeframes. Using proven and established IT capabilities and standards will help offices to streamline the process for acquiring and building IT systems and applications to meet their business needs and support efforts for consolidation and modernization of IT systems. It will also enable using newer and more flexible technology capabilities, such as applications that can be accessed from mobile devices. The following table reflects how the IT Roadmap can help office staff when considering new IT investments. These questions are examples of considerations based on the strategic needs identified in each of the IT Themes.

IT Theme
ˇ

Considerations
Will my application need to be accessible from a mobile device (e.g., Blackberry)? Will my application need to be accessible remotely using a secure network connection? Is there standard guidance to help me incorporate this capability? Should my initiative take advantage of collaboration tools? Do I need to integrate collaboration capabilities into my application? Do I need to share information or conduct working sessions with a distributed work group or external participants? Should my initiative or communication effort be facilitated using virtual meetings? How should I manage user access to my new application to increase security and reduce duplicate passwords? What shared security capabilities or services should I plan to use? Will my new system need to interface with an existing information or content repository? How will users easily find and access the information in my application? What tools will I be able to take advantage of to more easily find information I need? Since I am automating a business process, what tools and services can help? What technology transition or process improvement efforts are currently planned or underway that I could take advantage of for my business needs? Are common infrastructure services available or planned that I should consider using? If my application is critical, how can I ensure that it will be available and accessible when it is needed?

3. IT Themes
This section of the document details each of the five IT Themes which support the NRC's business needs over a multi-year timeframe. They have been organized and documented to include the business needs, strategies and solution sets, implementation timeframes, and business value propositions for each IT Theme.

3.1 Theme--"Working from Anywhere"
The NRC workforce has become more dispersed and mobile. As a result, employees require flexible ways to connect to the information and systems needed to complete their work, regardless of where they are working. To meet these changing needs, the agency is expanding current mobile access capabilities and using new technology solutions to satisfy business needs. The goal of the NRC's IT theme of "Working from Anywhere" is to give individuals secure access and use of the systems and information resources they need to do their work, at the same level of productivity, regardless of their physical location. The concept of a "virtual workplace" capability for a single user is central to this vision.

3.1.1 Business Needs
Although the NRC currently has some capabilities to support remote access, there are additional capabilities required to achieve the business goal desired for working from anywhere. These capabilities include the following: ˇ Distributed Working Locations--NRC staff needs to work remotely, when they are located in different buildings and geographic locations. ˇ Mobility--Using mobile devices and secure network access is essential for a highly mobile staff, such as resident inspectors who travel routinely. ˇ Disaster Management and Continuity of Operations--Being able to work from anywhere is necessary to support Disaster Recovery (DR), Continuity of Operations (COOP), and pandemic scenarios when offices may be closed or access may be limited ˇ Employee Retention / Work-Life Balance--Support for telecommuting and work-life balance initiatives is needed to help attract and retain a highly qualified workforce. ˇ Accelerated Implementation of Information Technologies--Accelerate the adoption of newer technologies (e.g., virtual private network (VPN) / laptops) that allow for greater levels of connectivity and access to applications and files, both inside and outside the NRC network. ˇ Managing Software Licensing and Version Control--Establish and control investments in desktop software to create a standard workstation configuration (software and product versions) that supports remote access to the NRC's applications and resources, and also makes it possible to automate remote installation of software updates for laptops and workstations. ˇ Improving Communication--Increase user awareness of existing work from anywhere tools and technology transition plans. ˇ Establishing and Communicating IT Policy--Establish, review and communicate the NRC policy early to increase user awareness and ensure an appropriate balance of business needs to managing security risks (e.g., use of secure wireless technology to connect to home networks).

ˇ Enhancing the NRC's IT Infrastructure--Provide secure and enhanced IT infrastructure to increase flexibility and improve system and information reliability and security, as well as communication capabilities at the NRC. The following table describes the types of mobile users at the NRC. Users may fall into one or more of these types depending on their role and work needs. For instance, a user could be both an Intra-NRC Traveler and a Domestic Traveler. Using these types, we can group and evaluate the mobile capabilities needed by the NRC workforce more effectively.

User Type
Intra-NRC Traveler

Description
User who accesses the NRC network while attending meetings or training at other NRC buildings or facilities. User who regularly works and accesses the NRC network from public and semipublic locations within the United States, such as airports, hotels, external training sites, conferences, contractor sites, and licensee sites. User who routinely works from home and is comfortable using remote access technologies such as Citrix. User who works from home occasionally, such as during weather emergencies, pandemic events, of for special project requirements. User who travels and works at locations outside of the United States. This includes individuals who frequently travel to work with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). User who accesses or manages the NRC systems and resources during a disaster or emergency event. This includes incident responders, facilities coordinators, key personnel involved in a COOP scenario, and IT system administrators. Table 4: NRC Mobile User Types

3.1.2 Strategies and Solution Sets
The following strategies and solution sets have been identified to address the business needs associated with working from anywhere. These have been characterized at a high-level to describe the phased delivery of new capabilities within this IT Theme. Over time, these will evolve as the needs of the NRC workforce change.

Working from Anywhere Strategies and Solution Sets Description
The laptop program focuses on large-scale improvements to deliver secure, standard laptops to meet the needs of the NRC's remote workers. This program will include: ˇ Increasing security controls (such as encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection and remote patching) for the standard laptop

configurations. Gradual replacement of existing workstations with laptops for designated staff so that mobile workers will have all of their data and applications no matter where they go. Currently, access to the NRC environment from a non-NRC computer is via a remote "virtual desktop" technology (e.g., Citrix). While this results in a secure connection to the NRC, only a select set of common applications are available on Citrix and access is limited to files on shared drives. Some of the additional capabilities Remote Access planned to enhance remote access include: ˇ Making additional commonly used productivity tools, such as Adobe, Microsoft Visio, and Microsoft Project available through Citrix. ˇ Evaluating centralized software licensing to support commonly used tools. The NRC has issued mobile devices such as Blackberrys for users to access their e-mail and schedule remotely, and thumb drives to work with their files. The strategy for improving these services includes: ˇ Reviewing Blackberry policies to allow use of currently disabled BlackBerrys features (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS)). ˇ Exploring the use of simplified web sites to help users find information "on the go" (e.g., internal "mobi" page for Blackberry users). ˇ Procuring additional NRC-provided removable thumb drives to transfer files securely between workstations including home computers.  Some behind the scenes IT infrastructure improvements include: ˇ Expanding storage space for network shared drives to allow 1 gigabyte (GB) per user. ˇ Upgrading and standardizing Microsoft Office versions to better   integrate with Outlook 2007. Behind the ˇ Implementing new secure network connection capability to allow Scenes users with NRC issued laptops to access the NRC network from Improvements public locations such as hotels, home networks, etc. and have the same access to applications, tools and information as they do while in the office. ˇ Supporting additional wireless capabilities such as using home wireless networks. Table 5: Working from Anywhere Strategies and Solution Sets The table below describes the capabilities that are planned to fulfil the requirements and business needs of working from anywhere. These capabilities are described as they exist today, and are also described as they will be implemented and matured in the future. The planning horizon of FY11 and beyond is predicated on availability of funding and adequate resources. Changes in the later timeframes may also be influenced by emergent business requirements.

3.2 Theme--"Working with Anyone"
The 2009 IT summit and cross-agency quick strike working groups revealed that the NRC staff faces significant challenges in effectively connecting and collaborating with other staff and external stakeholders across ever-increasing geographically dispersed offices and work sites. This includes collaboration with staff located within the NRC's offices, as well as with individuals in other Federal agencies, academia, industry, and the general public. The subject of these collaborative efforts ranges from publicly available information to sensitive material that must be controlled. The goal is to identify and implement appropriate collaboration and communication technology to improve the staff's productivity and effectiveness. This technology also supports business needs for increasing communication and transparency with external stakeholders such as licensees, the public and prospective employees who may use different collaboration and communication capabilities (e.g., various social networking tools).

3.2.1 Business Needs
The following diagram and table describes the types of relationships existing among different groups, both internal and external to the NRC, which are the foundation for supporting greater collaborative capabilities for these interactions. Relationships describe those we work or communicate with and the type of interactions conducted with that group.

3.3 Theme--"Universal Access"
Currently, the NRC's users must remember multiple login IDs and passwords, which sometime follow separate rules for different systems and applications. Each system or application follows its own method of controlling user access and verifying permissions. A user whose daily activities involve access to multiple application systems often needs to spend extra time managing login ID and password information (called credentials), by changing passwords based on unique schedules and rules, or calling the help desk to reset forgotten passwords. The common solution of writing down the login information poses security risks to the NRC and is not allowed. It is critical that the NRC use a common set of services and infrastructure for managing user access to applications and information resources. The goal is to provide ease of use to the staff while properly protecting applications and data. Key business drivers for enabling universal access include the following: ˇ User demand for simplified access, such as reducing the number of separate login actions to the systems that support their daily activities. ˇ Reducing the number of passwords that users must remember and separately manage by reusing the standard network ID and password. ˇ Making it easier for system owners and the IT security team to comply with Federal, OMB, and the NRC's policies, regulations, and mandates requiring secure access controls. These include Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, the newly published Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) roadmap, and other Certification & Accreditation (C&A) requirements. ˇ Centralizing access management controls and management of user access.

3.3.1 Business Needs
System users, system owners, and those responsible for IT security often have unique concerns and, sometimes, conflicting business needs. Users currently need help in remembering and managing multiple login names and passwords, as well as following the different rules each system requires for password creation and renewal. Users need fewer logins, more consistent password rules, and the ability to reset their passwords easily themselves. System owners want simpler ways to manage their user accounts, allowing them to easily add and remove users, or to set and change user permissions. System owners also need to ensure adequate access controls to protect their data are not overly burdensome. Staff at the Office of Information Systems (OIS) and the Computer Security Office (CSO) is responsible for overseeing that systems comply with regulations for IT security and access to IT systems and information. This includes coordinating and implementing a strategic NRC solution in response to government-wide initiatives, such as the use of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards. The following business and technical needs have been identified for universal access to support greater efficiency and security management of access to the NRC's resources: ˇ User Access-- o Providing self-service capabilities for routine security functions (e.g., reset password and removing user lockouts), making it easier for users to do this anytime, from any location. o Leveraging the standard network identification and password for system access.

24

33-11-325 Attachment A: Statement of Work
2009 The NRC IT Roadmap

Version 1.0

ˇ Use of Common Solutions-- o Providing a standard infrastructure set of tools and services to make it easy for system owners to access their applications by using the standard network id and password o Providing common solutions that make it easier for system owners to comply with Federal security requirements (e.g., HSPD-12) and to ensure a strong security posture for systems. ˇ Management of User Access-- o Providing the ability to more easily add, manage, and remove users' access to multiple systems (also called provisioning). o Making it easier to ensure user access to systems and information is at the required level. ˇ Audit and Compliance--Providing easier tracking and review of user access to systems and classified information across IT systems.

3.3.2 Strategies and Solution Sets
The following strategies and solution sets have been identified to address the business needs associated with universal access. These have been characterized at a high-level to describe the phased delivery of new capabilities within this IT Theme. Over time, these will needs and capabilities will evolve as the demands of the NRC workforce and standard security requirements change.  

Universal Access Strategies and Solution Sets Description
The primary goal of the RSO efforts is to standardize sign-on methods for agency systems and applications to the extent possible, to reducing the user burden of remembering and maintaining multiple usernamepassword combinations. This must be accomplished without compromising system-specific authentication requirements and while preserving appropriate unique access controls and security requirements of system owners. The ability to combine an existing password mechanism with another depends on many factors, including the underlying structure of the application, the age of the application, its adherence to industry standards (e.g., active directory awareness, webbased, integration with SharePoint), and degree of customization. Applications over which the NRC has limited or less control (e.g., E-Gov services) will present specific challenges but are more likely to adhere to modern industry standards. Some legacy applications may not be easily integrated with other sign-on processes until they are modernized or replaced. Password resets make up a large portion of all help desk calls and frustrate users who need quick access to their systems to do their work. This is vital for remote or mobile users who require password resets outside of business hours. While not all systems or applications are compatible with self-service resets, the goal is to identify applications and user circumstances where a simplified password reset can be automated quickly.

Universal Access Strategies and Solution Sets Description
Although Federal legislation (HSPD-12) for introducing physical PIV card credentials provided the initial impetus for this effort, this technology allows credentialing services to be integrated with the application signon process. The robust credentialing provided by a PIV card infrastructure can support not only user sign-ons but also digital signatures in systems where this level of confidence is either required or desirable. However, strict rules for PIV card management will present new challenges (for example, dealing with remote users who forget or lose their cards). The NRC is developing an identity and access management strategy and architecture to provide standard common authentication methods when implementing new and migrating existing applications. The enhanced Managed Public Key Infrastructure (MPKI) will simplify secure access to the NRC environment and support applications and initiatives such as the National Source Tracking System (NSTS) and Web-based licensing (WBL). Table 10: Universal Access Strategies and Solution Sets There are additional considerations for implementing these capabilities at the NRC to help ensure these tools can be used effectively and realize the established goals. These considerations include the following: ˇ Most applications have a custom built user authentication mechanism for managing user access and related information. These mechanisms often differ from application to application based upon application-specific requirements for managing and controlling user access. ˇ The most widely used applications will be a small subset of those used at the NRC, so enabling the most popular applications to use the common infrastructure services for user access and management will deliver the greatest benefit agency-wide. ˇ The Federal ICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance was issued in November 2009. It provides a common framework for use within the federal government, and supporting guidance and requirements for program managers, leadership, and stakeholders. OIS will review this material to determine alignment of the NRC activities in this area and identify appropriate areas to be addressed. System owners should work with OIS to plan for a transition to use common services as they are made available. This should be incorporated early into system planning processes. Some recommendations to assist with this planning include the following: ˇ Plan for transition to standard security services as part of new investment implementations, modernization efforts, or during upgrade cycles. ˇ For legacy systems, program offices and system owners must take the lead in identifying candidate systems for the transition to common services, and establishing priorities for systems to be modified. ˇ Determine transition requirements and the size of the user community for each application.

ˇ Rank applications by the size of the user community and similarity of transition requirements. This can further be refined by identifying similarities in transition requirements. For example, transition requirements for one application may be a subset of what is required for another, therefore implementing combined transition requirements facilitates integration of both applications. ˇ Transition applications with the largest user community first. The table below describes the capabilities planned for delivery to fulfil the requirements and business needs of universal access. These capabilities are described in terms of what is currently available and what will be implemented and matured over a 3+ year timeframe. The planning horizons of FY11 and beyond are predicated on availability of funding and adequate resources to conduct the work. Changes in the later timeframes may also be influenced by emergent business requirements.

FY 2011 and Beyond
 Transition users to PIV authentication for workstations and further expand the number of applications linked to PIV authentication.  Develop suggested architecture for RSO.  Examine implications of Federal Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) initiative.

Log into systems and applications using fewer or simpler user ID / password combinations

[Reduced Sign-On (RSO) Efforts] Three scenarios exist after a user logs into the NRC network to access an application:  Does not need to log in again, such as when accessing in Microsoft Outlook or a few SharePoint sites.  Needs to log in again but uses the same user ID / password combinations, that were used initially such as when accessing ClearQuest.  Needs to log in again using a different set of ID / password combinations than those used initially, such as for ADAMS, iLearn, and Time and Labor (T&L).

 Begin deployment of PIV card readers to workstations and training personnel. [Logical Credentials (HSPD12)]  Procuring contractor services for producing PIV cards and card reader.

 Develop processes and procedures and begin distributing HSPD-12 PIV cards.  Research the possible leverage of HSPD-12 PIV card technology to applying digital signatures to documents, including internal forms such as timesheets and various other forms.  Users will have the option of using their card or their password to access the systems.

3.4 Theme--"Easy Information Retrieval"
The NRC requires an integrated IT approach to support the quality, efficiency, and security of its regulatory and administrative business processes, with appropriate and straightforward access to information when needed, regardless of the user's location or access device. The NRC's vision of "Easy Information Retrieval" allows for greater discovery, access to, and retrieval of the NRC's information through enhanced search, information access, management, and integration capabilities. This vision is based on several agency drivers including: ˇ Designing workflows to support more standardized and efficient processes requires information standardization and simplified methods of access. ˇ Records management and retention requirements, such as e-Records Management, are driving the need for improved management of official agency records and information throughout its lifecycle. ˇ Agency technology transformation roadmaps and initiatives, such as Enterprise Content Management (ECM), are driving how information and content will be managed, requiring a simpler information access model and automating compliance with many Federal records requirements.

3.4.1 Business Needs
According to program office and OIS participants in the 2009 IT Summit and quick strike meetings, the NRC's personnel face challenges in finding and accessing the information they need to do their jobs. The following list outlines these business needs: ˇ Information Accessibility--Improving the ability to ensure appropriate and current information is available for sharing. Improving organization of information to make it easy to locate and use through a common set of directories that create a standard file structure (i.e., taxonomy) for better "accessibility and find-ability" of information. ˇ Integration of Information Sources--Improving sharing and integrating between multiple content sources (e.g., Tomoye, SharePoint and ADAMS, e-mail, and network drives) to ensure current information is available from its primary source. This will reduce issues and confusion with multiple copies and versions of information content being distributed and used. ˇ Electronic Routing/Faxing--Sending or receiving electronic vs. paper forms for review and approval. Sending or receiving electronic faxes from a workstation or email box. ˇ Improved SOPs/Best Practices--Promoting best practices and SOPs for how organizations and teams should collaborate more effectively when creating documents to avoid problems such as duplicates of work products present in different locations. This will help ensure the NRC's staff find accurate and authoritative information and avoid using extraneous and possibly outdated copies. ˇ More Effective Search--Improving search functions and capabilities to be more productive and effective by providing the ability to search multiple content sources and allowing more detailed searches to get the most relevant information quickly. ˇ Better Update of Web Content--Maintaining and updating content on the NRC public web site (www.NRC.gov) and other Web accessible sites to provide a "single point of truth" for consistent information, and improve the maintenance processes for published information to ensure its accuracy and quality.

3.4.2 Strategies and Solution Sets
The following strategies and solution sets have been identified to address the business needs associated with easy information retrieval. These have been characterized at a high-level to describe the phased delivery of new capabilities within this IT Theme. Over time, these will needs and capabilities will evolve as the demands of the NRC workforce changes.

Easy Information Retrieval Strategies and Solution Sets Description
Improved and transparent organization and definition of information classification (taxonomy) is essential to simplify information retrieval and enable users to easily find necessary and relevant information to do their jobs. By consistently organizing information, it is easier to navigate through web sites and other information repositories to find what is needed. Improving information organization will increase staff efficiency and reduce learning time by making it easy to locate information across organizations and repositories. Improved quality, efficiency, and security of the agency regulatory and administrative business processes through appropriate and straightforward access to information and records when needed, regardless of a user's location or access device. This will be accomplished through programs such as Enterprise Content Management (ECM). A new Web-based interface for capturing and managing data and information, with an improved search capability to find relevant information easily and quickly. New features of rule-based automatic email capture and streamlined profiling and classification will help find the information via a "one-stop shopping" experience. The NRC public Web user interface will be redesigned to improve usability. An integrated search and retrieval capability will be designed for unstructured content from all sources (e.g., ADAMS, Intranet, SharePoint, Tomoye, G Drives, etc.). The NRC will improve accessibility to include digitizing hardcopy records into electronic files in compliance with statutes and regulations. Providing improved workflow automation for sharing information using collaborative tools will also be part of the improvements.

Have better categorized information and content

[Better Taxonomy & Organization]  Some descriptions of content exist, but limited information (metadata) to describe content to facilitate searching and discovery of information across the agency.

[Enterprise Content Management]

Standardize information structures and repositories

 Variations in the definition and attributes of similar information sets, sources, and repositories across the NRC make it difficult to access and share information. This applies to all information sources that may require access by multiple systems and users across the NRC, not just the ECM.

 Standardize information structures and repository layouts across the different teams and groups based on similar subject areas and lines of business.  Standardize interfaces and data transformation services, such as Enterprise Information Gateway (EIG), for registering, obtaining, securing, and managing the NRC data.

Search for and find information more easily

[Improved Search] Ability to conduct searches within specific applications and systems. Current limitations with this include:  Limited ability to search across more than one content repository (e.g., SharePoint and web sites).  No ability to perform single search for both application data (structured) and content (unstructured) information.  Slow and cumbersome ADAMS user interface and difficulty in searching and finding documents unless the exact Main Library (ML) numbers are known.

 Begin usability analysis/study for the NRC public web site redesign.  New Google search access to some ADAMS documents.  Central enterprise portal (ePortal) Web page to make it easy to find and access commonly used Web-based applications.

 Ability for the public to easily navigate and search the NRC's web site and public ADAMS documents.

[Behind the Scenes]  Some reports exist, but limited reporting capabilities related to user behavior and trends.

 Reports with information about user behavior and trends related to searches (e.g., volumes over time, performance, and keywords used and their relative popularity).

Table 13: Easy Information Retrieval Capability Timeline Understanding the information needs of users (i.e., type of information needed the most) at the NRC is a critical step towards planning for greater information access and sharing, and serves to identify initial priority areas where this effort can begin. Consideration for the type of information with the highest priority (e.g., Licensing data), as well as who will access it is critical in planning greater information access capabilities (e.g., Search, etc.), and how those capabilities are deployed over time. To deliver the capabilities of easy information retrieval, a phased strategy is recommended: ˇ Determine priorities for information access--Decide how the NRC will implement capabilities for discovering, searching, and accessing enterprise information. ˇ Determine access channels for internal and external stakeholders o Internal Stakeholders: Greater abilities to search and report across various information repositories. Decide how system owners will provide greater access to and sharing of information between applications and systems. o External Stakeholders: Access to the NRC information should be enabled through established channels of communication such as the NRC public web site. This will require modifications to the existing public web site to allow greater information access by external stakeholders. Several factors will influence how the NRC implements the easy information retrieval theme: ˇ ECM Program--As a framework for managing several disparate portfolios, the ECM vision is having the right technology to better manage agency information content in a way that aligns with the business needs of the program and support offices, as well as the statutory and regulatory requirements for agency records.

ˇ Migration Plans--ADAMS software components are approaching retirement age. The NRC has started a two-phase migration plan: o Phase 1: Migrate the core platform to supported software along with data and user. o Phase 2: Migrate the major systems and interfaces such as EHD, EIE, e-Mail Capture, and DDMS, etc. to the new ECM platform. ˇ User Portal--Replacement of the old user portal, and the public web site redesign effort. ˇ IM and Quality Assurance Processes--Establish and use information management quality assurance processes to ensure information quality and consistency.

3.4.3 Business Value Propositions
Investment in secure technologies that enable users to more easily find the information resources they need when they need them to do their jobs will increase business efficiencies. The amount of information being managed electronically continues to grow at a rapid pace. There are multiple information repositories and sources used by staff in performing their daily activities. It is essential to find accurate and authoritative information to respond to requests and to make informed decisions. Specifically, the business value that will be achieved through this IT theme includes the following: ˇ Improved ability to find and access required content and information using simplified and more productive search capability. ˇ Increased staff productivity and time savings resulting from use of improved navigation, search and information repository tools. ˇ Greater ability to deliver business solutions using the NRC's information repositories in a shorter timeframe through the use of common information access and sharing capabilities. ˇ Improved access and availability to information resources from different user devices and locations. ˇ Improved decision-making processes by providing a comprehensive view of the NRC's information and records.

Segment Mapping to Business Enabling Applications Initiatives
All Federal agencies are required to define their EA. This term describes a framework that is used to manage and reflect the alignment of an agency's IT assets, projects, and resources with its business and operational activities and needs. In simpler terms, the EA shows how information and technology will support the business operations, increase efficiency and effectiveness, and produce business value. As such, the EA is an agency-wide asset and all Offices contribute to its development and transformation as reflected in the section below. The NRC continues to mature its EA to help achieve its mission goals of nuclear safety, nuclear security, and operational excellence. To effectively manage the complexities of architecting the enterprise, the NRC uses the OMB segment architecture approach to analyze similar business functions within the agency, based on a framework and vocabulary common across the Federal Government. The NRC has defined 14 segments (functional areas) that are divided into core mission areas that align to the major business functions of the organization, as well as the business and enterprise service areas necessary to maintain operational excellence. The following diagram illustrates the NRC's target architecture and the relationship among the segments, with an added component to show the user connectivity.

Figure 3: Segment Mapping to Business Enabling Applications The NRC target vision highlights the key business enablers and to-be systems, as described in the following table, which will form the core of the NRC's future environment. These are represented by current and planned investments in IT.

Instructions for the NRC ITISS Price Schedule Template
I. Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide a set of instructions for filling out the “Nuclear Regulatory Commission ITISS Price Schedule Template”.  This template is intended to allow the offeror to clearly present individual line items and corresponding cost to the NRC to meet the technical and service requirements specified in the ITISS SOW.
II. Overview of ITISS Cost Proposal Template
This template is divided into several worksheets.  The first page that proceeds these instructions serves as an overall summary of the costs associated with the contract.  This is also the location in which the offeror will be able to specify a proposed disincentive percentage to be associated with the contract (not to be less than 5%).  The following six pages are summaries for each potential year of the contract (including both the base period and option years of the contract).  All other pages are specific to a particular task, as defined in the ITISS SOW.
A. Summary Pages
The purpose of the summary pages is to present a clear overview of the offeror’s price estimate to the NRC.  Other than the disincentive percentage that is located on the “Overall Summary” page, all of the data on these summary pages are calculated and will not be directly edited by the offeror.  However, this data should still be reviewed by the offeror, prior to submission, in order to ensure the completeness and correctness of their bid.
B. Task-Specific Pages
The task-specific pages are to be used by the offeror to state their prices for each line item to address all technical and service requirements specified in the ITISS SOW.  The offeror may modify the areas highlighted in yellow on these pages .  The Offeror may add additional line items if they deem it necessary to complete the requested work but must ensure that the workbook calculations capture all of the projected cost elements. 
III. Completing the ITISS Cost Proposal Template
A. Summary Pages
The only editable information on any of the summary pages is the “Disincentive %” entry located on the “Overall Summary” page.  The value of disincentive percentage, which must be at least 5%, may be further increased by the offeror.  This ability to propose an increased disincentive percentage allows the offeror to express confidence in their ability to meet or exceed the Service Level Requirements (SLRs) associated with each task of the contract.  In the event that any SLR for a given service (e.g. Electronic Mail and Messaging, Personal Computing and Related Software Licensing, Network Components, etc) is not met during a particular month, the offeror would agree to a reduction in the fees charged for the affected service(s), as per the indicated percentage, for that month.
B. Task-Specific Pages
When entering information into the task-specific pages, the following considerations should be made:
· The unit field lists the unit type of the listed item.  Typically, this unit type will be one of the following:
o Per User (typically used for per-unit pricing)
o Hour (typically used for labor costs)
If adding a new line item, the Offeror should ensure that any description for units sufficiently conveys its meaning to the NRC reviewer(s).
· The technical proposal reference field should be used to indicate the location in which the line item can be identified in the offeror’s technical proposal.
· In some cases, a given component may have a zero (0) in the estimated quantity column.  The Offeror should still enter a price for that line item for that period so that services could be ordered if required.
· All prices provided by the Offeror shall be on a per-year basis and shall be calculated against the number of units estimated for that line item.

Instructions for the NRC ITISS Inventory List
I. Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide information regarding the current inventory associated with all contracts that are to be integrated into the ITISS contract.  This includes the inventory currently associated with the ITISS Core tasks, as well the Additional Tasks.  This inventory list is intended to provide an approximate representation of the current assets associated with this contract.  This inventory is representative of a “snapshot” of a constantly changing environment, and as such, will not fully represent the inventory at time of ITISS award.  This information is provided to the prospective bidder to allow them to approximately gauge the resources currently being used to meet the majority of requirements of the ITISS contract.
II. Overview of ITISS Inventory List
This list is divided into several pages (i.e. worksheets).  Each page lists all components and services for each ITISS task, per the following categories:
· Device Provisioning / Leasing (i.e. hardware – including both GFE and equipment currently owned/leased by the current contractors)
· Software licensing (including both GFE and software currently owned/leased by current Icontractors)
· Management Services (e.g. service contracts, helpdesk support, etc.) not included in the hardware costs
The Offeror should not attempt to model their bid after the items listed in the inventory list.  Instead, the Offeror should use the list to understand the as-is environment, to more accurtely prepare their proposal.  In addition, the contents of the inventory list may be used as a reference to determine an appropriate set of services that will effectively meet NRC user need.
III. Reading the ITISS Inventory List
The following are detailed descriptions of the noteworthy fields on each page of the Inventory List:
· Description: This field provides a brief description of the inventory item.
· Unit: The unit type of the listed item.  Typically, this unit type will be one of the following:
o Each (typically used for per-unit pricing)
o Hours (typically used for labor pricing) = calculated as the number of hours per year
o Set price (typically used for subcontracted services for which unit or hour costs are not available)
o Cost of Materials (used for the cost reimbursement contracts currently utilized in some additional tasks)
· Additional Comments: This field is used to convey any additional information regarding the inventory item.  Such information includes if the item is GFE, if the item is utilized within multiple tasks, if estimated values were used for either the quantity or price of the item, etc.

NRCAR Subpart 2009.5 Organizational Conflicts of Interest
§2009.500 Scope of subpart.
In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2210a., NRC acquisitions are processed in accordance with §2009.570, which takes precedence over FAR 9.5 with
respect to organizational conflicts of interest. Where non-conflicting guidance appears in FAR 9.5, that guidance must be followed.
§2009.570 NRC organizational conflicts of interest.
§2009.570-1 Scope of policy.
(a) It is the policy of NRC to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize contractor organizational conflicts of interest. The NRC achieves this objective
by requiring all prospective contractors to submit information describing relationships, if any, with organizations or persons (including those
regulated by the NRC) which may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest in the event of contract award.
(b) Contractor conflict of interest determinations cannot be made automatically or routinely. The application of sound judgment on virtually a
case-by-case basis is necessary if the policy is to be applied to satisfy the overall public interest. It is not possible to prescribe in
advance a specific method or set of criteria which would serve to identify and resolve all of the contractor conflict of interest situations
that might arise. However, examples are provided in these regulations to guide application of this policy guidance. The ultimate test is as
follows: Might the contractor, if awarded the contract, be placed in a position where its judgment may be biased, or where it may have an unfair
competitive advantage?
(c) The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies to contractors and offerors only. Individuals or firms who have other
relationships with the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are not covered by this regulation. This rule does not apply to the
acquisition of consulting services through the personnel appointment process, NRC agreements with other Government agencies, international
organizations, or state, local, or foreign Governments. Separate procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest will be employed in these
agreements, as appropriate.
§2009.570-2 Definitions.
Affiliates means business concerns which are affiliates of each other when either directly or indirectly one concern or individual controls or
has the power to control another, or when a third party controls or has the power to control both.
Contract means any contractual agreement or other arrangement with the NRC except as provided in §2009.570-1(c).
Contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, affiliates thereof, or their
successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel (identified in the contract), proposed consultants or
subcontractors, which are a party to a contract with the NRC.
Evaluation activities means any effort involving the appraisal of a technology, process, product, or policy.
Offeror or prospective contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, or
their affiliates or successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel, proposed consultants, or subcontractors,
submitting a bid or proposal, solicited or unsolicited, to the NRC to obtain a contract.
Organizational conflicts of interest means that a relationship exists whereby a contractor or prospective contractor has present or planned
interests related to the work to be performed under an NRC contract which:
(1) May diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objective assistance and advice, or may otherwise result in a biased work
product; or
(2) May result in its being given an unfair competitive advantage.
Potential conflict of interest means that a factual situation exists that suggests that an actual conflict of interest may arise from award of a
proposed contract. The term potential conflict of interest is used to signify those situations that
(1) Merit investigation before contract award to ascertain whether award would give rise to an actual conflict; or
(2) Must be reported to the contracting officer for investigation if they arise during contract performance.
Research means any scientific or technical work involving theoretical analysis, exploration, or experimentation.
Subcontractor means any subcontractor of any tier who performs work under a contract with the NRC except subcontracts for supplies and
subcontracts in amounts not exceeding $10,000.
Technical consulting and management support services means internal assistance to a component of the NRC in the formulation or administration of
its programs, projects, or policies which normally require that the contractor be given access to proprietary information or to information that
has not been made available to the public. These services typically include assistance in the preparation of program plans, preliminary designs,
specifications, or statements of work.
§2009.570-3 Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational conflicts of interest.
(a) General.
(1) Two questions will be asked in determining whether actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist:
(i) Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or contractor's judgment in relation to its work for the NRC?
(ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive advantage based on the performance of the contract?
(2) NRC's ultimate determination that organizational conflicts of interest exist will be made in light of common sense and good business
judgment based upon the relevant facts. While it is difficult to identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoiding all of the
various situations or relationships that might involve potential organizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particular
attention to proposed contractual requirements that call for the rendering of advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar
activities that directly lay the groundwork for the NRC's decisions on regulatory activities, future procurements, and research programs. Any
work performed at an applicant or licensee site will also be closely scrutinized by the NRC staff.
(b) Situations or relationships. The following situations or relationships may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest:
(1) The offeror or contractor shall disclose information that may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the following
circumstances. The information may include the scope of work or specification for the requirement being performed, the period of performance,
and the name and telephone number for a point of contact at the organization knowledgeable about the commercial contract.
(i) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and recommendations to the NRC in the same technical area where it is also providing
consulting assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.
(ii) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on the same or similar matter on which it is also providing assistance to any
organization regulated by the NRC.
(iii) Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or services, or has been substantially involved in the development or marketing
of the products or services of another entity.
(iv) Where the award of a contract would result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased
in relation to its work for the NRC, or would result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
(v) Where the offeror or contractor solicits or performs work at an applicant or licensee site while performing work in the same technical area
for the NRC at the same site.
(2) The contracting officer may request specific information from an offeror or contractor or may require special contract clauses such as
provided in §2009.570-5(b) in the following circumstances:
(i) Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications that are to be used in competitive procurements of products or services covered by
the specifications.
(ii) Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific approaches or methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive
procurements using the approaches or methodologies.
(iii) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to information not available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, or programs
that could form the basis for a later procurement action.
(iv) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to proprietary information of its competitors.
(v) Where the award of a contract might result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in
relation to its work for the NRC or might result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
(c) Policy application guidance. The following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to identify and resolve all contractor
organizational conflict of interest situations.
(1)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a Request For Proposal (RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component as
called for in the RFP. The ABC Corp. is one of several companies considered to be technically well qualified. In response to the inquiry in the
RFP, the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing similar analyses for the reactor manufacturer.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work normally would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. because the company would be placed in a
position in which its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because there are other well-qualified companies
available, there would be no reason for considering a waiver of the policy.
(2)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to perform certain analyses of a reactor component that is unique to one type of
advanced reactor. As is the case with other technically qualified companies responding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing various projects
for several different utility clients. None of the ABC Corp. projects have any relationship to the work called for in the RFP. Based on the NRC
evaluation, the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best qualified company to perform the work outlined in the RFP.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABC Corp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate bias with
respect to the work. An appropriate clause would be included in the contract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for work
with the private sector that could create a conflict during the performance of the NRC contract. For example, ABC Corp. would be precluded from
the performance of similar work for the company developing the advanced reactor mentioned in the example.
(3)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a competitive RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in revising NRC's guidance documents on
the respiratory protection requirements of 10 CFR Part 20. ABC Corp. is the only firm determined to be technically acceptable. ABC Corp. has
performed substantial work for regulated utilities in the past and is expected to continue similar efforts in the future. The work has and will
cover the writing, implementation, and administration of compliance respiratory protection programs for nuclear power plants.
(ii) Guidance. This situation would place the firm in a role where its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because
the nature of the required work is vitally important in terms of the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of
the policy, in accordance with §2009.570-9 may be warranted. Any waiver must be fully documented in accordance with the waiver provisions of
this policy with particular attention to the establishment of protective mechanisms to guard against bias.
(4)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. submits a proposal for a new system to evaluate a specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of
developing standards that are important to the NRC program. The ABC Corp. has advised the NRC that it intends to sell the new system to industry
once its practicability has been demonstrated. Other companies in this business are using older systems for evaluation of the specific reactor
component.
(ii) Guidance. A contract could be awarded to the ABC Corp. if the contract stipulates that no information produced under the contract will be
used in the contractor's private activities unless this information has been reported to the NRC. Data on how the reactor component performs,
which is reported to the NRC by contractors, will normally be disseminated by the NRC to others to preclude an unfair competitive advantage.
When the NRC furnishes information about the reactor component to the contractor for the performance of contracted work, the information may not
be used in the contractor's private activities unless the information is generally available to others. Further, the contract will stipulate
that the contractor will inform the NRC contracting officer of all situations in which the information, developed about the performance of the
reactor component under the contract, is proposed to be used.
(5)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to assemble a map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian fold
belt. In accordance with the representation in the RFP and §2009.570-3(b)(1)(i), ABC Corp. informs the NRC that it is presently doing
seismological studies for several utilities in the eastern United States, but none of the sites are within the geographic area contemplated by
the NRC study.
(ii) Guidance. The contracting officer would normally conclude that award of a contract would not place ABC Corp. in a conflicting role where
its judgment might be biased. Section 2052.209-72(c) Work for Others, would preclude ABC Corp. from accepting work which could create a conflict
of interest during the term of the NRC contract.
(6)(i) Example. AD Division of ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in the safety and environmental review of
applications for licenses for the construction, operation, and decommissioning of fuel cycle facilities. ABC Corp. is divided into two separate
and distinct divisions, AD and BC. The BC Division performs the same or similar services for industry. The BC Division is currently providing
the same or similar services required under the NRC's contract for an applicant or licensee.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. The AD Division could be placed in a position to
pass judgment on work performed by the BC Division, which could bias its work for NRC. Further, the Conflict of Interest provisions apply to ABC
Corp. and not to separate or distinct divisions within the company. If no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy could be sought
in accordance with §2009.570-9.
(7)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. completes an analysis for NRC of steam generator tube leaks at one of a utility's six sites. Three months later,
ABC Corp. is asked by this utility to perform the same analysis at another of its sites.
(ii) Guidance. Section 2052.290-72(c)(3) would prohibit the contractor from beginning this work for the utility until one year after completion
of the NRC work at the first site.
(8)(i) Example. ABC Corp. is assisting NRC in a major on-site analysis of a utility's redesign of the common areas between its twin reactors.
The contract is for two years with an estimated value of $5 million. Near the completion of the NRC work, ABC Corp. requests authority to
solicit for a $100K contract with the same utility to transport spent fuel to a disposal site. ABC Corp. is performing no other work for the
utility.
(ii) Guidance. The Contracting Officer would allow the contractor to proceed with the solicitation because it is not in the same technical area
as the NRC work; and the potential for technical bias by the contractor because of financial ties to the utility is slight due to the relative
value of the two contracts.
(9)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. is constructing a turbine building and installing new turbines at a reactor site. The contract with the utility is
for five years and has a total value of $100 million. ABC Corp. has responded to an NRC Request For Proposal requiring the contractor to
participate in a major team inspection unrelated to the turbine work at the same site. The estimated value of the contract is $75K.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract would not normally be awarded to ABC Corp. because these factors create the potential for financial loyalty to
the utility that may bias the technical judgment of the contractor.
(d) Other considerations.
(1) The fact that the NRC can identify and later avoid, eliminate, or neutralize any potential organizational conflicts arising from the
performance of a contract is not relevant to a determination of the existence of conflicts prior to the award of a contract.
(2) It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional reputation of being able to resist temptations which arise from organizational
conflicts of interest, or that a follow-on procurement is not involved, or that a contract is awarded on a competitive or a sole source basis.
§2009.570-4 Representation.
(a) The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC contracting officer in determining whether situations or relationships exist which
may constitute organizational conflicts of interest with respect to a particular offeror or contractor. The procedures apply to small purchases
meeting the criteria stated in the following paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) The organizational conflicts of interest representation provision at §2052.209-71 must be included in solicitations and contracts resulting
from unsolicited proposals. The contracting officer must also include this provision for task orders and contract modifications for new work
for:
(1) Evaluation services or activities;
(2) Technical consulting and management support services;
(3) Research; and
(4) Other contractual situations where special organizational conflicts of interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would be
included in the resulting contract. This representation requirement also applies to all modifications for additional effort under the contract
except those issued under the "Changes" clause. Where, however, a statement of the type required by the organizational conflicts of interest
representation provisions has previously been submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating of the statement is
required.
(c) The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work contained in
a RFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion. Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC in the
evaluation of proposals. If the NRC considers the proposed excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work and its
exclusion would be to the detriment of the competitive posture of the other offerors, the NRC shall reject the proposal as unacceptable.
(d) The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is
considered to be a minor informality. The offeror will be permitted to correct the omission.
§2009.570-5 Contract clauses.
(a) General contract clause. All contracts and simplified acquisitions of the types set forth in §2009.570-4(b) must include the clause
entitled, "Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest," set forth in §2052.209-72.
(b) Other special contract clauses. If it is determined from the nature of the proposed contract that an organizational conflict of interest
exists, the contracting officer may determine that the conflict can be avoided, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with §2009.570-9,
neutralized through the use of an appropriate special contract clause. If appropriate, the offeror may negotiate the terms and conditions of
these clauses, including the extent and time period of any restriction. These clauses include but are not limited to:
(1) Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of production contracts following a related non-production contract previously
performed by the contractor;
(2) Software exclusion clauses;
(3) Clauses which require the contractor (and certain of its key personnel) to avoid certain organizational conflicts of interest; and
(4) Clauses which provide for protection of confidential data and guard against its unauthorized use.
§2009.570-6 Evaluation, findings, and contract award.
The contracting officer shall evaluate all relevant facts submitted by an offeror and other relevant information. After evaluating this
information against the criteria of §2009.570-3, the contracting officer shall make a finding of whether organizational conflicts of interest
exist with respect to a particular offeror. If it has been determined that real or potential conflicts of interest exist, the contracting
officer shall:
(a) Disqualify the offeror from award;
(b) Avoid or eliminate such conflicts by appropriate measures; or
(c) Award the contract under the waiver provision of §2009.570-9.
§2009.570-7 Conflicts identified after award.
If potential organizational conflicts of interest are identified after award with respect to a particular contractor and the contracting officer
determines that conflicts do exist and that it would not be in the best interest of the Government to terminate the contract, as provided in the
clauses required by §2009.570-5, the contracting officer shall take every reasonable action to avoid, eliminate, or, after obtaining a waiver in
accordance with §2009.570-9, neutralize the effects of the identified conflict.
§2009.570-8 Subcontracts.
The contracting officer shall require offerors and contractors to submit a representation statement from all subcontractors (other than a supply
subcontractor) and consultants performing services in excess of $10,000 in accordance with §2009.570-4(b). The contracting officer shall require
the contractor to include contract clauses in accordance with §2009.570-5 in consultant agreements or subcontracts involving performance of work
under a prime contract.
§2009.570-9 Waiver.
(a) The contracting officer determines the need to seek a waiver for specific contract awards with the advice and concurrence of the program
office director and legal counsel. Upon the recommendation of the Senior Procurement Executive, and after consultation with legal counsel, the
Executive Director for Operations may waive the policy in specific cases if he determines that it is in the best interest of the United States
to do so.
(b) Waiver action is strictly limited to those situations in which:
(1) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the NRC program;
(2) The work cannot be satisfactorily performed except by a contractor whose interests give rise to a question of conflict of interest.
(3) Contractual and/or technical review and surveillance methods can be employed by the NRC to neutralize the conflict.
(c) The justification and approval documents for any waivers must be placed in the NRC Public Document Room.
§2009.570-10 Remedies.
In addition to other remedies permitted by law or contract for a breach of the restrictions in this subpart or for any intentional
misrepresentation or intentional nondisclosure of any relevant interest required to be provided for this section, the NRC may debar the
contractor from subsequent NRC contracts.

 SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES



 C.1  52.212-1  INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUNE 2008)


                 (Applies to all Firm Fixed Price CLINS in Section B.1.)

  (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size
standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a
concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
  (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in
this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum,
offers must show—
    (1) The solicitation number;
    (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
    (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
    (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.
This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
    (5) Terms of any express warranty;
    (6) Price and any discount terms;
    (7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;
    (8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and
certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
    (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
    (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar
items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
    (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and
provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions
of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for
receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the
sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
  (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office
designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after
the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of
entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and
was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be
considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office
designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received
at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile
offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers,
the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions
with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However,
the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may
reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.
  (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

C.2 52.212-4  CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAR 2009) ALTERNATE I (OCT 2008)


                       (Applies to all Time and Material CLINS in Section B.1.)

   (a) Inspection/Acceptance.

     (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent
practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect
the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in
a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

     (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and
shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.

     (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as
promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.

     (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after
acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct
services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this
clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours
incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise
specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance
materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when
required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]

     (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement
or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may--

         (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such
increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or

         (B) Terminate this contract for cause.

       (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the
contract.

     (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or
replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is
due to--

       (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or

       (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's
managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.

     (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and
services originally delivered under this contract.

     (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery
do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.

     (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be
governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

   (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a
bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31
U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Government wide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not
assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.

   (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.

   (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this
contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be
a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor
shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.

   (e) Definitions.

     (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause--

       (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.

       (ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a
labor category specified in the contract that are--

         (A) Performed by the Contractor;

         (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or

         (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control.

       (iii) Materials means--

         (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common
control;

         (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.

           (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

           (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the
overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.

       (ii) Materials.

         (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such
materials shall be the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--

           (1) Quantities being acquired; and

           (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.

         (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the
actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the Contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the
Contractor--

           (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or

           (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

         (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--

           (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials;
and

           (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable
to the contract.

         (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed.

           (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such
costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer
usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the
Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement
for other direct costs will be provided, insert 'None".']

           (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect
costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs
and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery
contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or,
if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert 'None')."]

     (2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling
price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all
obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and
material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously
accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised
estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the
performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be
substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised
estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this
contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less
than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of
effort to be required under the contract.

     (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule,
and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless
and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a
revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set
forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before
the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the
ceiling price.

     (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will
have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting
Officer):

       (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories
specified in the contract;

       (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as
substantiation for payment--

         (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);

         (B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;

         (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and

         (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown
on the invoices.

       (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost--

         (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and

         (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.

     (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices,
that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The
Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If
the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor
shall--

       (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the--

         (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);

         (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;

         (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and

         (D) Contractor point of contact.

       (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.

     (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due
until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the

amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.

       (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.

       (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if--

         (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2).

       (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the

       (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation,
and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties
agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following
completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in
writing) from the date of completion.

notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.

       (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against

reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have
resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for

     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.

     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect
an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor shall be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the
EFT clause of this contract.

     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

requirements of essential tasks as defined in the Statement of Work which already are in operation or are scheduled.




C.11  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDING ACCESS APPROVAL (JUL 2007)


   The Contractor shall ensure that all its employees, subcontractor employees or consultants who are assigned to perform the work herein for
contract performance for periods of more than 30 calendar days at NRC facilities, are approved by the NRC for unescorted NRC building access.

   The Contractor shall conduct a preliminary federal facilities security screening interview or review for each of its employee, subcontractor
employee, and consultants and submit to the NRC only the names of candidates for contract performance that have a reasonable probability of
obtaining approval necessary for access to NRC's federal facilities. The Contractor shall pre- screen its applicants for the following:

     (a) felony arrest in the last seven years; (b) alcohol related arrest within the last five years; (c) record of any military courts-martial
convictions in the past 10 years; (d) illegal use of narcotics or other controlled substances possession in the past year, or illegal purchase,
production, transfer, or distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances in the last seven years; (e) delinquency on any federal debts
or bankruptcy in the last seven years.

   The Contractor shall make a written record of its pre-screening interview or review (including any information to mitigate the responses to
items listed in (a) - (e)), and have the applicant verify the pre-screening record or review, sign and date it.  Two copies of the pre-screening
signed record or review shall be supplied to FSB/DFS with the Contractor employee's completed building access application package.

   The Contractor shall further ensure that its employees, any subcontractor employees and consultants complete all building access security
applications required by this clause within ten business days of notification by FSB/DFS of initiation of the application process.  Timely
receipt of properly completed records of the Contractor's signed pre-screening record or review and building access security applications
(submitted for candidates that have a reasonable probability of obtaining the level of security clearance necessary for access to NRC's
facilities) is a contract requirement.  Failure of the Contractor to comply with this contract administration requirement may be a basis to
cancel the award, or terminate the contract for default, or offset from the contract's invoiced cost or price the NRC's incurred costs or delays
as a result of inadequate pre-screening by the Contractor.  In the event of cancellation or termination, the NRC may select another firm for
contract award.

   A Contractor, subcontractor employee or consultant shall not have access to NRC facilities until he/she is approved by FSB/DFS.  Temporary
access may be approved based on a favorable NRC review and discretionary determination of their building access security forms.  Final building
access will be approved based on favorably adjudicated checks by the Government.  However, temporary access approval will be revoked and the
Contractor's employee may subsequently be denied access in the event the employee's investigation cannot be favorably determined by the NRC.
Such employee will not be authorized to work under any NRC contract requiring building access without the approval of FSB/DFS.  When an
individual receives final access, the individual will be subject to a review or reinvestigation every five years.

   The Government will have and exercise full and complete control and discretion over granting, denying, withholding, or terminating building
access approvals for individuals performing work under this contract.  Individuals performing work under this contract at NRC facilities for a
period of more than 30 calendar days shall be required to complete and submit to the Contractor representative an acceptable OPM Form 85P
(Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions), and two FD 258 (Fingerprint Charts). Non-U.S. citizens must provide official documentation to the
FSB/DFS, as proof of their legal residency.  This documentation can be a Permanent Resident Card, Temporary Work Visa, Employment Authorization
Card, or other official documentation issued by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  Any applicant with less than two years
residency in the U. S. will not be approved for building access. The Contractor shall submit the documents to the NRC Project Officer (PO) who
will give them to FSB/DFS.

   FSB/DFS may, among other things, grant or deny temporary unescorted building access approval to an individual based upon its review of the
information contained in the OPM Form 85P and the Contractor's pre-screening record.  Also, in the exercise of its authority, the Government
may, among other things, grant or deny permanent building access approval based on the results of its review or investigation.  This submittal
requirement also applies to the officers of the firm who, for any reason, may visit the NRC work sites for an extended period of time during the
term of the contract.  In the event that FSB/DFS are unable to grant a temporary or permanent building access approval, to any individual
performing work under this contract, the Contractor is responsible for assigning another individual to perform the necessary function without
any delay in the contract's performance schedule, or without adverse impact to any other terms or conditions of the contract.  The Contractor is
responsible for informing those affected by this procedure of the required building access approval process (i.e., temporary and permanent
determinations), and the possibility that individuals may be required to wait until permanent building access approvals are granted before
beginning work in NRC's buildings.

 CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF BUILDING  ACCESS/ REQUEST

   The Contractor shall immediately notify the PO when a Contractor or su bContractor employee or consultant's need for NRC building access
approval is withdrawn or the need by the Contractor employee's for building access terminates.  The PO will immediately notify FSB/DFS (via e-
mail) when a Contractor employee no longer requires building access.  The Contractor shall be required to return any NRC issued badges to the
Project Officer for return to FSB/DFS within three days after their termination.


C.12  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LEVEL I OR LEVEL II ACCESS APPROVAL (JUL 2007)


   The proposer/Contractor must identify all individuals and propose the level of Information Technology (IT) approval for each, using the
following guidance. The NRC sponsoring office shall make the final determination of the level, if any, of IT approval required for all
individuals working under this contract. The Government shall have and exercise full and complete control and discretion over granting, denying,
withholding, or terminating IT access approvals for individuals performing work under this contract.

   The Contractor shall conduct a preliminary security interview or review for each IT level I or II access approval Contractor applicant and
submit to the Government only the names of candidates that have a reasonable probability of obtaining the level of IT security access for which
the candidate has been proposed. The Contractor shall pre-screen its applicants for the following:

     (a)    felony arrest in the last seven years; (b) alcohol related arrest within the last five years; (c) record of any military courts-
martial convictions in the past ten years; (d) illegal use of narcotics or other controlled substances possession in the past year, or illegal
purchase, production, transfer, or distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances in the last seven years; (e) delinquency on any
federal debts or bankruptcy in the last seven years.

   The Contractor shall make a written record of its pre-screening interview or review (including any information to mitigate the responses to
items listed in (a) - (e)), and have the applicant verify the pre-screening record or review, sign and date it.  Two copies of the signed
Contractor's pre-screening record or review will be supplied to FSB/DFS with the Contractor employee's completed building access application
package.

   The Contractor shall further ensure that its employees, any subcontractor employees and consultants complete all IT access security
applications required by this clause within ten business days of notification by FSB/DFS of initiation of the application process.  Timely
receipt of properly completed records of the pre-screening record and IT access security applications (submitted for candidates that have a
reasonable probability of obtaining the level of security assurance necessary for access to NRC's facilities) is a contract requirement. Failure
of the Contractor to comply with this contract administration requirement may be a basis to cancel the award, or terminate the contract for
default, or offset from the contract's invoiced cost or price the NRC's incurred costs or delays as a result of inadequate pre-screening by the
Contractor.  In the event of cancellation or termination, the NRC may select another firm for contract award.

 (d) The Contractor shall immediately provide the contracting officer written notice of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI over the
Contractor which would affect the answers to the questions presented in DD Form 441S, "Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interest".  Further,
notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade
Commission, or the Department of Justice shall also be furnished concurrently to the contracting officer.

 (e) In those cases where a Contractor has changes involving FOCI, the NRC must determine whether the changes will pose an undue risk to the
common defense and security. In making this determination, the contracting officer shall consider proposals made by the Contractor to avoid or
mitigate foreign influences.

 (f) The Contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause including this paragraph (g) in all
subcontracts under this contract that will require access to classified information.  Additionally, the Contractor shall require such
subcontractors to submit  completed information required on the DD Form 441 form prior to award of a subcontract. Information to be provided by
a subcontractor pursuant to this clause may be submitted directly to the contracting officer.

 (g) Information submitted by the Contractor or any affected subcontractor as required pursuant to this clause shall be treated by NRC to the
extent permitted by law, as business or financial information submitted in confidence to be used solely for purposes of evaluating FOCI.

 (h) The requirements of this clause are in addition to the requirement that a Contractor obtain and retain the security clearances required by
the contract. This clause shall not operate as a limitation on NRC's rights, including its rights to terminate this contract.

 (i) The contracting officer may terminate this contract for default either if the Contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause,
e.g., provide the information required by this clause, comply with the contracting officer's instructions about safeguarding classified
information, or make this clause applicable to subcontractors, or if, in the contracting officer's judgment, the Contractor creates a FOCI
situation in order to avoid performance or a termination for default. The contracting officer may terminate this contract for convenience if the
Contractor becomes subject to FOCI and for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, or chooses not to, avoid or
mitigate the FOCI problem.




 C.22  2052.204.70  SECURITY (MAR 2004)


 (a) Contract Security and/or Classification Requirements (NRC Form 187).  The policies, procedures, and criteria of the NRC Security Program,
NRC Management Directive (MD) 12 (including MD 12.1, "NRC Facility Security Program;" MD 12.2, "NRC Classified Information Security Program;" MD
12.3, "NRC Personnel Security Program;" MD 12.4, "NRC Telecommunications Systems Security Program;" MD 12.5, "NRC Automated Information Systems
Security Program;" and MD 12.6, "NRC Sensitive Unclassified Information Security Program"), apply to performance of this contract, subcontract
or other activity.  This MD is incorporated into this contract by reference as though fully set forth herein.  The attached NRC Form 187 (See
List of Attachments) furnishes the basis for providing security and classification requirements to prime Contractors, subcontractors, or others
(e.g., bidders) who have or may have an NRC contractual relationship that requires access to classified Restricted Data or National Security
Information or matter, access to sensitive unclassified information (e.g., Safeguards), access to sensitive Information Technology (IT) systems
or data, unescorted access to NRC controlled buildings/space, or unescorted access to protected and vital areas of nuclear power plants.

 (b)  It is the Contractor's duty to protect National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data.  The Contractor
shall, in accordance with the Commission's security regulations and requirements, be responsible for protecting National Security Information,
Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data, and for protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss, and theft, the classified documents and
material in the Contractor's possession in connection with the performance of work under this contract.  Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this contract, the Contractor shall, upon completion or termination of this contract, transmit to the Commission any classified matter in the
possession of the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in connection with performance of this contract.  If retention by the
Contractor of any classified matter is required after the completion or termination of the contract and the retention is approved by the
contracting officer, the Contractor shall complete a certificate of possession to be furnished to the Commission specifying the classified
matter to be retained.  The certification must identify the items and types or categories of matter retained, the conditions governing the
retention of the matter and their period of retention, if known.  If the retention is approved by the contracting officer, the security
provisions of the contract continue to be applicable to the matter retained.

 (c)  In connection with the performance of the work under this contract, the Contractor may be furnished, or may develop or acquire, safeguards
information, or confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information, including Commission plans, policies, reports,
financial plans,  internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93.579), or other information which has not been released to the
public or has been determined by the Commission to be otherwise exempt from disclosure to the public.  The Contractor shall ensure that
information protected from public disclosure is maintained as required by NRC regulations and policies, as cited in this contract or as
otherwise provided by the NRC.  The Contractor shall not directly or indirectly duplicate, disseminate, or disclose the information in whole or
in part to any other person or organization except as may be necessary to perform the work under this contract.  The Contractor agrees to return
the information to the Commission or otherwise dispose of it at the direction of the contracting officer.  Failure to comply with this clause is
grounds for termination of this contract.

 (d)  Regulations.  The Contractor agrees to conform to all security regulations and requirements of the Commission which are subject to change
as directed by the NRC Division of Facilities and Security (DFS) and the Contracting Officer. These changes will be under the authority of the
FAR Changes clause referenced in this document.

 The Contractor agrees to comply with the security requirements set forth in NRC Management Directive 12.1, NRC Facility Security Program which
is incorporated into this contract by reference as though fully set forth herein.  Attention is directed specifically to the Section titled
"Infractions and Violations," including "Administrative Actions" and "Reporting Infractions."

 (e)  Definition of National Security Information.  The term National Security Information, as used in this clause, means information that has
been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12958 or any predecessor order to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and that is so
designated.

 (f)  Definition of Restricted Data.  The term Restricted Data, as used in this clause, means all data concerning design, manufacture, or
utilization of atomic weapons; the production of special nuclear material; or the use of special nuclear material in the production of energy,
but does not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category pursuant to Section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended.

 (g)  Definition of Formerly Restricted Data.  The term Formerly Restricted Data, as used in this clause, means all data removed from the
Restricted Data category under Section 142-d of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

 (h) Definition of Safeguards Information.  Sensitive unclassified information that specifically identifies the detailed security measures of a
licensee or an applicant for the physical protection of special nuclear material; or security measures for the physical protection and location
of certain plant equipment vital to the safety of production of utilization facilities.  Protection of this information is required pursuant to
Section 147 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

 (i)  Security Clearance.  The Contractor may not permit any individual to have access to Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, or other
classified information, except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations or requirements
applicable to the particular type or category of classified information to which access is required.  The Contractor shall also execute a
Standard Form 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement, when access to classified information is required.

 (j)  Criminal Liabilities.  It is understood that disclosure of National Security Information, Restricted Data, and Formerly Restricted Data
relating to the work or services ordered hereunder to any person not entitled to receive it, or failure to safeguard any Restricted Data,
Formerly Restricted Data, or any other classified matter that may come to the Contractor or any person under the Contractor's control in
connection with work under this contract, may subject the Contractor, its agents, employees, or subcontractors to criminal liability under the
laws of the United States. (See the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794; and Executive Order
12958.)

 (k)  Subcontracts and Purchase Orders.  Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the contracting officer, the Contractor shall insert
provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase orders under this contract.

In performing the contract work, the Contractor shall classify all documents, material, and equipment originated or generated by the Contractor
in accordance with guidance issued by the Commission.  Every subcontract and purchase order issued hereunder involving the origination or
generation of classified documents, material, and equipment must provide that the subcontractor or supplier assign classification to all
documents, material, and equipment in accordance with guidance furnished by the Contractor.

C. 28 52.232-7  PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS  (FEB 2007) ALTERNATE I  (FEB 2007)


     The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized
representative:

   (a) Hourly rate.

     (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor
category specified in the contract that are--

       (i) Performed by the Contractor;

       (ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or

       (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control.

     (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor
hours performed.

     (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.
Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is
performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.

     (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall
be payable on a prorated basis.

     (5) Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting
Officer or authorized representative. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly
rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by--

       (i) Individual daily job timekeeping records;

       (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or

       (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.

     (6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government will, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject
to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative.

     (7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the
Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to
protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this
clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor
executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause.

     (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the
Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to
the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.

   (b) Materials.

     (1) For the purposes of this clause--

       (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.

       (ii) Materials means--

         (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common
control;

         (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract;

         (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer
usage charges, etc.); and

         (D) Applicable indirect costs.

     (2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such
materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--

       (i) Quantities being acquired; and

       (ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.

     (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials
provided the Contractor--

       (i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or

       (ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such
payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

     (4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine
allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract.

     (5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are--

       (i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate;

       (ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and

       (iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates.

     (6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--

       (i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and

       (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take
advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit
to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the
Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the
benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government.

     (7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials.

   (c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such
consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the
Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at
the sole discretion of the Government.

   (d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price
set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations
under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material
costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued,
will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of
the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this
contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater
or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price
for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has
reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price,
the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the
contract.

   (e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and
the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and
until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised
ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in
the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the
increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling
price.

   (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting
documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the
Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the "completion voucher" and supporting
documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents
and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government will promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and
supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract,
but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.

   (g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at
the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under
this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:

     (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.

     (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.

     (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.

   (h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services.

     (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are
not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.

     (2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 30th day after the designated billing office
receives a proper payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure
compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due
date.

   (i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will
make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

   (j) The terms of this clause that govern reimbursement for materials furnished are considered to have been deleted.

C. 30 2052.209-72 CONTRACTOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (JAN 1993)


   (a)  Purpose.  The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the Contractor:

     (1)  Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise)
which relate to the work under this contract; and

     (2)  Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.

   (b)  Scope.  The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the Contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the
activities covered by this clause.

   (c)  Work for others.

     (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the Contractor agrees to forego entering into
consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with
respect to the work being performed under this contract.  The Contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the
provision of this clause.  If the Contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or
other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the Contractor shall obtain the
written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement.

     (2)  The Contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or
review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services
within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the Contractor's support to
explain or defend the Contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions.

     (3)  When the Contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the Contractor shall neither
solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the
award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under
the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract).

     (4)  When the Contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site,

       (i)  The Contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order
or the contract, as appropriate.

       (ii)  The Contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order
or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter.

       (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the Contractor to solicit or perform this type of work
(except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for
technical bias or unfair competitive advantage.

   (d)  Disclosure after award.

     (1)  The Contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does
not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2.

     (2)  The Contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall
make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer.  This statement must include a description of the action which the
Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.  The NRC may, however, terminate the contract if termination is in
the best interest of the Government.

     (3)  It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities.
Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the Contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees
or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract.  Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or
applicant site, the Contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site.  This
disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at
least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover
and disclose is provided by the Contractor and approved by the contracting officer.  The disclosure must include the Statement of Work, the
dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or
other regulated entity.  NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area
and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when
the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this Section.

   (e)  Access to and use of information.

     (1)  If in the performance of this contract, the Contractor obtains access to information, such as NRC plans, policies, reports, studies,
financial plans, internal data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C.
Section 552 (1986)), the Contractor agrees not to:

       (i)  Use this information for any private purpose until the information has been released to the public;

       (ii)  Compete for work for the Commission based on the information for a period of six months after either the completion of this
contract or the release of the information to the public, whichever is first;

       (iii)  Submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government based on the information until one year after the release of the information to
the public; or

       (iv)  Release the information without prior written approval by the contracting officer unless the information has previously been
released to the public by the NRC.

     (2)  In addition, the Contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or
privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, the Contractor shall treat the information in accordance with
restrictions placed on use of the information.

     (3)  Subject to patent and security provisions of this contract, the Contractor shall have the right to use technical data it produces
under this contract for private purposes provided that all requirements of this contract have been met.

   (f)  Subcontracts.  Except as provided in 48 CFR 2009.570-2, the Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in
subcontracts of any tier.  The terms contract, Contractor, and contracting officer, must be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's
rights.

   (g)  Remedies.  For breach of any of the above restrictions, or for intentional nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant interest
required to be disclosed concerning this contract or for such erroneous representations that necessarily imply bad faith, the Government may
terminate the contract for default, disqualify the Contractor from subsequent contractual efforts, and pursue other remedies permitted by law or
this contract.

   (h)  Waiver.  A request for waiver under this clause must be directed in writing to the contracting officer in accordance with the procedures
outlined in 48 CFR 2009.570-9.

   (i)  Follow-on effort.  The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in NRC contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited
or unsolicited), which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract.  Furthermore, unless so directed in writing
by the contracting officer, the Contractor may not perform any technical consulting or management support services work or evaluation activities
under this contract on any of its products or services or the products or services of another firm if the Contractor has been substantially
involved in the development or marketing of the products or services.

     (1)  If the Contractor, under this contract, prepares a complete or essentially complete Statement of Work or specifications, the
Contractor is not eligible to perform or participate in the initial contractual effort which is based on the Statement of Work or
specifications.  The Contractor may not incorporate its products or services in the Statement of Work or specifications unless so directed in
writing by the contracting officer, in which case the restrictions in this paragraph do not apply.

  2) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the Contractor from offering or selling its standard commercial items to the Government.

portions of the NRC Contractor Drug Testing Program. The Headquarters ADPC function is carried out by the Drug Program Manager in the Division
of Facilities and Security, Office of Administration. All sample collection, testing, and review of test results shall be conducted by the NRC
“drug testing Contractor.” The NRC will reimburse the NRC “drug testing Contractor” for these services.

drug use or those who are found through other means
to be using drugs illegally. The Plan includes pre-assignment, random, reasonable suspicion, and post-accident drug testing. The due process
procedures applicable to NRC employees under NRC=s Drug Testing Program are not applicable to Contractors, consultants, subcontractors and their
employees. Rather, a Contractor's employees and their subcontractors are subject to the procedures and terms of their employment agreements with
their employer.

subject to testing under this clause in accordance with the Plan. The NRC will reimburse the NRC “drug testing Contractor” for collecting,
testing, and reviewing test results. Any NRC Contractor found to be using, selling, or possessing illegal drugs, or any Contractor with a
verified positive drug test result under this program while in a duty status will immediately be removed from working under the NRC contract.
The Contractor’s employer will be notified of the denial or revocation of the individual's authorization to have access to information and
ability to perform under the contract. The individual may not work on any NRC contract for a period of not less than one year from the date of
the failed drug test and will not be considered for reinstatement unless evidence of rehabilitation, as determined by the NRC “drug testing
Contractor’s” Medical Review Officer, is provided.

Contractor drug testing records are protected under the NRC Privacy Act Systems of Records,

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the Offeror and/or any of its principals-
-

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against
them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
Government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of
any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount
that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

       (ii) Examples.

         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court
review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further
appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is
in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

     (1) Listed end products.

     (2) __ Outside the United States.

   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the Offeror as to its compliance
with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt
services.)

     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The Offeror [  ] does [  ] does not

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a
monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the
contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and

       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that
used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

       (i) If the Offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the Offeror if the Offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1)
or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the Offeror is required to provide this

on five scored criteria: 1) Technical Approach and Service Solution, 2) Technical Qualifications of key personnel and technical Staff, 3)
Corporate Experience Past Performance, 4) Program Management, and 5) Subcontracting.


The Government will evaluate an Offeror's proposal from the perspective of the technical merits and price and award a contract to the
responsible Contractor whose proposal will quote the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Evaluation factors
weights are listed next to each evaluation factor. The total possible points equal 100. All evaluation factors when combined are significantly
more important than cost or price. Price will not be point scored.  In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, the total estimated
amount for each contract period (all contract line items) will be added together for cost proposal evaluation purposes.

The Source Evaluation panel (SEP) will identify each Offeror's strengths and weaknesses for each criterion, and assign an overall numerical
rating to each criterion as explained below, considering the relative weight of each technical evaluation criterion.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.  TECHNICAL APPROACH (25 points out of 100)

   Offers shall be evaluated on the extent to which their proposal demonstrates an understanding of the performance based statement of work
   (PSOW) in a sound technical approach and comprehensive implementation plan for accomplishing the scope of work program and service objectives
   contained in clauses C.3.1, C.3.2, the services described at section C.5 and C.6, as well as the service delivery and management requirements
   of section C.5.2 of the PSOW. Offers shall also be evaluated on the extent to which their proposal demonstrates an understanding of the PSOW
   as reflected in the quality of processes and tools proposed for use to accomplish service delivery, inclusive of how congruent the proposed
   processes, systems and methodology are with ITIL v3 based service management. The offeror’s methodology shall also be evaluated for clarity
   and effectiveness and for how well it demonstrates performance that meets NRC service level requirements set forth at Appendix A of the PSOW,
   inclusive of how well the offeror’s methodology address ITIL v3 compliance and how it plans to assist NRC in maturing its service delivery
   with respect to each section of PSOW clause 5.2.

   Offers shall be evaluated based on the technical qualifications, experience, knowledge, education, skill and training of personnel proposed
   for performance of this contract, to include ITIL v3 expert certification for the program manager (or other key personnel). Offerors whose
   proposed personnel have ITIL v3 expert certification will be more favorably rated.

3.  CORPORATE EXPERIENCE AND PAST PERFORMANCE (20 points out of 100)

      3(a). CORPORATE EXPERIENCE (10 points out of 100)


      Extent to which the offeror’s proposal demonstrates corporate experience on ongoing contracts and contracts completed within the past three
      (3) years, similar in size and scope to the effort described in this requirement


      3(b). PAST PERFORMANCE (10 points out of 100)


      Extent to which the offeror’s proposal demonstrates successful past performance on ongoing contracts and contracts completed within the
      past three (3) years, similar in size and scope to the effort described in this requirement, which employed ITIL based Service Management,
      and the extent to which the offeror attained applicable goals for small business participation under contracts that required subcontracting
      plans.

4.  PROGRAM MANAGEMENT (20 points out of 100)

   Extent to which the proposed program management plan demonstrates a coordinated and effective management and organizational structure so as to
   respond to both routine and rapid response task orders.  Extent to which the plan provides consistent management monitoring of workload, cost,
   timely submittal of project status and cost information, meeting schedules, problem resolution, integration of tasks, management of the IT
   infrastructure as a unified program, methodology for mitigating risk, and a specific plan for quality control.

  The NRC will assess the offeror’s proposed small, small disadvantaged, (8(a), service disabled veteran-owned small business, Hubzone and women-
  owned small business subcontracting plan and approach in relation to NRC goals.  If the prime contractor is a small business, the highest
  score will be given for this criterion. If the prime contractor is not a small business, that offeror is required to provide a sub-contracting
  plan dedicating a minimum of 20% of the contract award to small businesses.

  The offeror’s Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated in terms of the offeror’s

  Proposed subcontracting goals (overall subcontracting goals and individual subcontracting goals by small business category) in comparison to
  the Contracting Officer’s assessment of the appropriate subcontracting goals for this procurement.

  Meeting the requirements of FAR 19.704 Subcontracting Plan Requirements. The evaluation of the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be on
  the basis of total contract value.

  The SEP will evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed SDB Participation along with supporting rationale against total contract value.
  Specific identification of SDB contractors and associated work will be evaluated for feasibility.


  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).


  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
