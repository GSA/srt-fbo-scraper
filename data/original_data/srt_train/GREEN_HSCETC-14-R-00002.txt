The Contractor shall conduct exit interviews to ensure that Contractor personnel who no longer require access to DHS/ICE sensitive information understand their obligation not to discuss or disclose DHS/ICE sensitive information to which they were granted access under this contract.

Physical Security The Contractor shall ensure that access to Contractor buildings, rooms, work areas and spaces, and structures that house DHS/ICE sensitive information or IT systems through which DHS/ICE sensitive information can be accessed, is limited to authorized personnel. The Contractor shall ensure that controls are implemented to deter, detect, monitor, restrict, and regulate access to controlled areas at all times. Controls shall be sufficient to safeguard IT assets and DHS/ICE sensitive information against loss, theft, destruction, accidental damage, hazardous conditions, fire, malicious actions, and natural disasters. Physical security controls shall be implemented in accordance with the relevant ICE policies and guidance. The Contractor shall ensure that the development facilities are approved through the C&A for storing Government information. H.7-PRIVACY CONTROL 1.0 Privacy Requirements for IT Security Plan Personally Identifiable Information is any information that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly inferred, including any other information that is linked or linkable to that individual regardless of whether the individual is a United States citizen, legal permanent resident, or a visitor to the U.S. Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a subset of PII, which if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. Complete social security numbers (SSN), alien registration numbers (A-number) and biometric identifiers (such as fingerprint, voiceprint, or iris scan) are considered Sensitive PII even if they are not coupled with additional PII. Additional examples include any grouping of information that contains the individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Driver's license number, passport number, or truncated SSN (such as last-4 digits) Date of birth (month, day, and year) Citizenship or immigration status Financial information such as account numbers or Electronic Funds Transfer information Medical information System authentication information such as mother's maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs)

The IT Security Plan must address how this information will be protected.

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

NOTE: Other PII may be "sensitive" depending upon its context, such as a list of employees with less than satisfactory performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. In contrast, a business card or a public phone directory of agency employees contains PII but is not sensitive. The work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of Sensitive PII in order to perform a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or one of its components. The Contractor shall provide DHS or the DHS component access to and information regarding the Contractor's systems when requested by the Department in connection with its efforts to ensure compliance with all such security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Department in such efforts. DHS and DHS component access shall include independent validation testing of controls, system penetration testing by DHS or DHS component, FISMA data reviews, and access by the DHS Office of the Inspector General for its reviews. For all systems handling Sensitive PII, the Contractor shall comply with all security requirements applicable to DHS systems described in DHS Sensitive System Publication 4300A or any replacement publication, and those of the DHS component for which the contract is being performed. The use of Contractor-owned laptops or other media storage devices to process or store Sensitive PII is prohibited. 2.0 Handling of Personally Identifiable Information

The Contractor must limit access to the data covered by this clause to those employees who need the information to perform work under this contract. Contractor must physically secure Sensitive PII when not in use and/or under the control of an authorized individual, and ensure it is secured when in transit to prevent unauthorized access or loss. If the Contractor is e-mailing Sensitive PII within the DHS network (i.e. from a DHS e-mail account (dhs.gov) to another DHS e-mail account), the information can be sent unencrypted. If Sensitive PII is being sent outside of the DHS network (i.e. e-mailing it from a DHS e-mail address to a non-DHS e-mail address or vice versa), the information must be encrypted. If Sensitive PII is stored on a shared drives, access to it should be restricted to those with a need to know by permissions settings or passwords. The "Handbook for Safeguarding Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information at the Department of Homeland Security" provides additional guidance for the proper handling of Sensitive PII. Sensitive PII shall not be transported overseas without the prior written approval of the CO. When Sensitive PII is no longer needed and no longer required to be retained under applicable records retention policies, it must be destroyed through means that will make the Sensitive PII irretrievable. Contractor may only use Sensitive PII obtained under this contract for purposes of the contract, and may not collect or use such information for any other purpose without the prior written approval of the CO. At the expiration of the contract, the Contractor shall turn over all Sensitive PII obtained under this contract that is still in its possession to DHS or DHS component.

3.0 Privacy Training and Awareness The Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor personnel (including Sub-contractor personnel) take the annual Culture of Privacy training. The Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor personnel (including Sub-contractor personnel) take the annual Records Management training. 4.0 Breach Response

A breach is defined as the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users have access or potential access to personally identifiable information, whether physical or electronic, without an authorized purpose. By acceptance of, or performance on, this contract, the Contractor agrees that in the event of any actual or suspected breach of Sensitive PII, the Contractor will immediately (and in no event later than within one hour of discovery) report the breach to the CO and contracting officer's technical representative (COR), and the DHS or DHS component information security response team. The Contractor is responsible for positively verifying that the notification is received and acknowledged. If the data breach occurs outside of regular business hours and/or neither the CO nor the COR can be reached, the Contractor shall call the DHS or DHS component Computer Emergency Readiness Team within one hour of discovery of the breach. The Contractor shall also notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours. 5.0 Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement

The Contractor will certify that it has in place procedures and the capability to promptly notify any individual whose Sensitive PII was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached. The method and content of any notification by the Contractor shall be coordinated with, and be subject to the approval of, DHS or the DHS Component. Notification shall not proceed unless DHS or the DHS component has made a determination that notification is appropriate and would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security. The method of notification may include letter sent via first class mail, electronic means, or general public notice, as approved by DHS or DHS component. As a minimum, the notification should include: (1) a brief description of how the breach occurred; (2) a description of the types of personal information involved in the breach; (3) a statement as to whether the information was encrypted or protected by other means; (4) steps an individual may take to protect themselves; and (5) who affected individuals should contact for more information. In the event that a Sensitive PII breach occurs as a result of the violation of a term of this contract by the Contractor or its employees, the Contractor shall, when directed by the CO and at no cost to the government, take action to correct or mitigate the violation, which may include providing notification or other identity protection services to affected individuals for a period not to exceed eighteen months from the discovery of the breach. The Contractor shall be responsible Page 35 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

for the acts or omissions of its employees that contribute to a Sensitive PII breach when any such employee had access to such PII by virtue of his or her employment by the Contractor. All mitigation and corrective measures must be approved by the CO. DHS or the DHS component may elect to provide and/or procure notification or identity protection services, in which case the Contractor will be responsible for reimbursing DHS or the DHS component for those costs. The requirements set forth in this section apply to all subcontractors who perform work in connection with this contract. For each subcontractor, the Contractor must certify that it has required the subcontractor to adhere to all such requirements. Any breach by a subcontractor of any of the provisions set forth in this clause will be attributed to the Contractor. H.8-ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS Accessibility Requirements (Section 508) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), they must ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities.

A firm may rely on the information contained in SAM as an accurate representation of a concern's size and ownership characteristics for the purposes of maintaining a small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business source list. Use of SAM as its source list does not relieve a firm of its responsibilities (e.g., outreach, assistance, counseling, or publicizing subcontracting opportunities) in this clause.

Contractors having commercial plans need not comply with this requirement. (e) In order to effectively implement this plan to the extent consistent with efficient contract performance, the Contractor shall perform the following functions: (1) Assist small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and womenowned small business concerns by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate the participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor's lists of potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business concerns an opportunity to compete over a period of time.

(6) For all competitive subcontracts over the simplified acquisition threshold in which a small business concern received a small business preference, upon determination of the successful subcontract offeror, the Contractor must inform each unsuccessful small business subcontract offeror in writing of the name and location of the apparent successful offeror prior to award of the contract. (f) A master plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements required by paragraph (d) of this clause, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of the offeror by this clause; provided -(1) The master plan has been approved; (2) The offeror ensures that the master plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved master plan, including evidence of its approval, to the Contracting Officer; and (3) Goals and any deviations from the master plan deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the individual subcontracting plan. (g) A commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. The commercial plan shall relate to the offeror's planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and Government business, rather than solely to the Government contract. Once the Contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government will not require another subcontracting plan from the same Contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the Contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item. A contractor with a commercial plan shall comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (d)(10) of this clause by submitting one SSR in eSRS for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report shall be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the Contracting Officer who approved the plan. This report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government's fiscal year. (h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract. (i) A contract may have no more than one plan. When a modification meets the criteria in 19.702 for a plan, or an option is exercised, the goals associated with the modification or option shall be added to those in the existing subcontract plan. (j) Subcontracting plans are not required from subcontractors when the prime contract contains the clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, or when the subcontractor provides a commercial item subject to the clause at 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Items, under a prime contract. (k) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with-- Page 53 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(1) The clause of this contract entitled "Utilization Of Small Business Concerns;" or (2) An approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract. (l) The Contractor shall submit ISRs and SSRs using the web-based eSRS at http://www.esrs.gov. Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the prime Contractor or subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract award data reported by prime Contractors and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made to lower tier subcontractors unless the Contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business credit from an ANC or Indian tribe. Only subcontracts involving performance in the United States or its outlying areas should be included in these reports with the exception of subcontracts under a contract awarded by the State Department or any other agency that has statutory or regulatory authority to require subcontracting plans for subcontracts performed outside the United States and its outlying areas. (1) ISR. This report is not required for commercial plans. The report is required for each contract containing an individual subcontract plan.

Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period. (ii) When a subcontracting plan contains separate goals for the basic contract and each option, as prescribed by FAR 19.704(c), the dollar goal inserted on this report shall be the sum of the base period through the current option; for example, for a report submitted after the second option is exercised, the dollar goal would be the sum of the goals for the basic contract, the first option, and the second option. (iii) The authority to acknowledge receipt or reject the ISR resides-- (A) In the case of the prime Contractor, with the Contracting Officer; and (B) In the case of a subcontract with a subcontracting plan, with the entity that awarded the subcontract. (2) SSR. (i) Reports submitted under individual contract plans--

Page 54 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(A) This report encompasses all subcontracting under prime contracts and subcontracts with the awarding agency, regardless of the dollar value of the subcontracts. (B) The report may be submitted on a corporate, company or subdivision (e.g. plant or division operating as a separate profit center) basis, unless otherwise directed by the agency. (C) If a prime contractor and/or subcontractor is performing work for more than one executive agency, a separate report shall be submitted to each executive agency covering only that agency's contracts, provided at least one of that agency's contracts is over $650,000 (over $1.5 million for construction of a public facility) and contains a subcontracting plan. For DoD, a consolidated report shall be submitted for all contracts awarded by military departments/agencies and/or subcontracts awarded by DoD prime Contractors. (D) The consolidated SSR shall be submitted annually for the twelve month period ending September 30. The report is due 30 days after the close of the reporting period. (E) Subcontract awards that are related to work for more than one executive agency shall be appropriately allocated.

(iii) All reports submitted at the close of each fiscal year (both individual and commercial plans) shall include a Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses. The report shall include subcontract awards, in whole dollars, to small disadvantaged business concerns by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector. If the data are not available when the year-end SSR is submitted, the prime Contractor and/or subcontractor shall submit the Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses within 90 days of submitting the year-end SSR. For a commercial plan, the Contractor may obtain from each of its subcontractors a predominant NAICS Industry Subsector and report all awards to that subcontractor under its predominant NAICS Industry Subsector.

As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and Page 60 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; Page 61 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. The Offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003; __ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003, but it has submitted a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.108-7004, which has not been denied; or __ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.108-7004. (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of clause) HSAM 3052.209-72-ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (JUN 2006) (a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting related to the Investigative Case Management requirement is unknown at this time. (b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: ___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or ___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision. (d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan. (e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. (f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or dive stures that may affect this provision. (g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. (End of provision) HSAR 3052.209-73-LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (JUN 2006) (a) The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. Accordingly, the attention of prospective offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5--Organizational Conflicts of Interest. (b) The nature of this conflict is any contractor providing services under the ICM contract may have access to information that would prohibit them from assisting in preparing proposals for future related acquisitions. (c) The restrictions upon future contracting are as follows: (1) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of tasks pursuant to this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work that are to be incorporated into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the Page 63 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

work described in that solicitation as a prime or first-tier subcontractor under an ensuing DHS contract. This restriction shall remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the duration of the initial production contract). DHS shall not unilaterally require the Contractor to prepare such specifications or statements of work under this contract. (2) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other companies, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use them to compete with those other companies. (End of clause) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST The following paragraphs in this section clarify the responsibilities of the Contractor regarding organizational conflict of interest. Prior to award, the contractor must disclose immediately with its offer any relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, in writing to the Contracting Officer. The contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is discovered after award, the contractor will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than three working days after discovery. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware, or should have been aware, of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award, or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. The contractor further agrees to insert provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph, in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder.

FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.2097, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. Page 71 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

Page 72 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Provision) FAR 52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jul 2013) (a) Definitions. As used in this provision-- "Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. "Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means-- (1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and (2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules). "Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

(b) The offeror [_] has [_] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000.

(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. (iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-- (A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or (B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. (iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. (d) The offeror shall post the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the System for Award Management database via https://www.acquisition.gov (see 52.204-7).

If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) Contract award. Page 85 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(1) In lieu of submitting certified cost or pricing data, offerors may submit a written request for exception by submitting the information described in the following subparagraphs.

(2) The offeror grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before award, books, records, documents, or other directly pertinent records to verify any request for an exception under this provision, and the reasonableness of price. For items priced using catalog or market prices, or law or regulation, access does not extend to cost or profit information or other data relevant solely to the offeror's determination of the prices to be offered in the catalog or marketplace. (b) Requirements for certified cost or pricing data. If the offeror is not granted an exception from the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data, the following applies: (1) The offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data, and data other than certified cost or pricing data, and supporting attachments in accordance with the instructions contained in Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408, which is incorporated by reference with the same force and effect as though it were inserted here in full text.

All mail and packages are now comprehensively screened at DHS' Consolidated Remote Delivery Site (CRDS) before delivery to ICE headquarters facilities. While ensuring mail and packages are safe, CRDS screening delays deliveries by one to five days. Therefore, in order to meet the due date and time as specified in the RFP, Offerors will need to take the following steps: 1) Submit its proposal via a delivery service that utilizes a tracking mechanism and delivery receipt/confirmation (i.e., FedEx, UPS, etc.); 2) Ensure the Mail Stop Code 5750 is included in the address on the label; 3) Send the tracking number ahead of time to the CRDS at info@crdsmail.com so that they can flag it on the loading dock to ensure that the package gets on the bio sample for the same day and expedite delivery to the Contracting Office; cc: the Contract Specialist on the e-mail; and 4) E-mail a copy of the signed receipt for accepting the package to the designated Contract Specialist above to establish the delivery date/time to the Government. Delivery date/time must be on or before the due date/time listed above. Proposals submitted through the US Postal Service shall be mailed to the address noted above. Proposals must be sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, or registered mail so that a tracking number can be utilized. Because of tightened security measures, this method of delivery is strongly discouraged. Packages arriving through the postal service are screened and may be damaged prior to receipt at ICE. These actions and other uncertain delays are probable and outside the control of ICE, which may mean that a proposal may be inadvertently eliminated from the competition. A summary of the submission requirements for each Volume is shown in the Table 1 on the following page:

SECTION M-EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M.1-PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE Provision 52.217-4 52.217-5 Description Evaluation of Options Exercised at Time of Contract Award Evaluation of Options Date June 88 July 90

M.2-EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.2.1-Evaluation Factors for Award. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award upon initial proposals. Therefore, the Offerors initial proposal should contain the Offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. For evaluation purposes the base period plus all five (5) options will be evaluated together. The evaluation factors for this solicitation are: 1. Technical a. Technical Approach b. Management Approach 2. Past Performance 3. Business and Price M.2.2-Relative Importance of Factors Factor 1 (Technical) is more important than Factor 2 (Past Performance). Sub-factor 1-Technical Approach is more important than Sub-Factor 2Management Approach. An overall rating will be assigned to Factor 1 (Technical). Elements under each sub-factor are of equal importance. Factor 2 (Past Performance) is more important than Factor 3 (Business & Price). Factors 1 and 2, when combined, are more important than Factor 3, Business & Price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior technical capability. As the non-priced factors of competing proposals become comparable, Business and Price will become more important in any trade off decisions in deciding an award(s).

Page 108 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

M.2.3-Basis of Award The determination of best value will be made by comparing the differences in the ratings for the Technical Factor, Past Performance Factor with the proposed Business and Price Factor. The Government will make this assessment through trade-off analysis of benefits of superior abilities, ability and probability of successful contract performance versus the added cost. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of the contract as proposals become more equal based on other factors. One or more Contractors, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and are determined based on the evaluation criteria to represent the best value to the Government, will be chosen for contract award. If more than one contract is awarded, the Government will fund the base period of each contract. After all Contractors deliver their final Proof of Concept as a formal deliverable for the base period, the Government will only exercise Option Period 1 for one of the contracts. If only one contract is awarded, the Government may award both the base period and exercise Option Period 1 at the time of award.. The Government reserves to award up to four (4) standalone contracts. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all. M.3-Evaluation Process M.3.1-STEP 1 (OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES DEMONSTRATION) EVALUTION CRITERIA Each Offeror's Operational Capabilities Demonstration (OCD) will be evaluated using the following factor to determine their current solution's viability:  FACTOR 1: Maturity of the Offeror's current system to meet the requirements of the OCD:

The Offeror's ICM system must demonstrate a high level of existing capability to meet the requirements of the OCD. Step 1 is meant to provide an advisory down-select to Offerors with the potential for success at an acceptable level of risk. The system proposed by the Offeror during the OCD will be evaluated as to whether or not they have demonstrated the ability to meet the requirements of the preplanned scenario provided by the Government, and whether they are likely to be a viable competitor in accordance with the criteria set forth below. These criteria will be used to rate each Offeror's OCD. 1. The degree to which the proposed investigative case management system demonstrates existing ("out of the box") capability to substantially meet the system capabilities of the preplanned scenario of the OCD with a potential for success in Step 2 at an acceptable level of risk. The Contracting Officer will notify each Offeror, in writing, by e-mail of the results of their OCD evaluation. Offerors who are notified that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor are encouraged to evaluate their likelihood of receiving an award and decision to continue to Step 2. Any Offeror who provides an OCD in Step 1 may participate in Step 2. Page 109 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

M.3.2-STEP 2 EVALUTION FACTORS Proposals will be evaluated using the following three (3) factors to make a best value determination: 
 

o o

FACTOR 1: Technical Sub-factor 1: Technical Approach Sub-factor 2: Management Approach FACTOR 2: Past Performance FACTOR 3: Business & Price

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The Government will rank Offerors. M.3.3-FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL Sub-Factor 1: Technical Approach The Technical Approach Sub-Factor will be evaluated on the degree to which the Offeror's proposal demonstrates the following:  Solution Details: The degree to which the solution details (including hardware, software, high level system architecture, and hosting) demonstrate the proposed solution can be delivered on schedule, within budget, and within the constraints of the SOO. The degree to which the solution permits the Government to replace or upgrade the system or add enhancements through a competitive process and limits the use of proprietary or vendorunique hardware/software in solution development Gap Analysis and Response to High Level Requirements: The degree to which the Offeror's completed Response to Attachment 7-High Level Capabilities Matrix validates the existing solution's capabilities in meeting the business, mission, and technical capabilities of the SOO. The degree to which the Gap Analysis thoroughly identifies potential performance gaps and provides a viable plan (to include identified of risks, risk mitigation strategies, and milestone schedules) to bridge these gaps. The Government will also evaluate the degree to which the proposed schedules are realistic and achievable in support of the Government's requirement to achieve code freeze and IOC



Page 110 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management



Performance Work Statement: The degree to which the proposed PWS provides a comprehensive solution to delivering the ICM-unique mission and technical requirements detailed in the SOO; the degree to which the proposed milestone schedule supports ICE's objectives of eliminating its dependency on the CBP Mainframe by the date specified in the SOO; the degree to which the Contractor Work Breakdown Structure (CWBS) supports its proposed solution Sub-Factor 2: Management Approach The Management Approach Sub-factor will be evaluated based on the following:

 







Delivery Approach: The degree to which the Offeror's Delivery Approach demonstrates an ability to deliver the ICM solution on time, within budget, and within the constraints outlined in Attachment 1-Statement of Objectives. Staffing Approach: The degree to which the Offeror's Staffing Approach, including the proposed Key Personnel, demonstrates the Offeror's commitment to providing hands-on personnel with the experience and expertise necessary to successfully adapt the proposed ICM solution to the ICE environment in a timely manner. Unpriced Basis of Estimate: The degree to which the BOE demonstrates that the Offeror has reviewed and understands Attachment 1-Statement of Objectives and all associated deliverables and has accurately assessed the required resources to support the efforts to complete the work to be performed and deliver the proposed solution. QASP: The degree to which the systematic quality assurance methods and standards ensure requirements and contractor performance metrics in this contract are met so that the Government receives the quality of services called for in the Contractor's proposed PWS and incorporated in the Contract. Hardware/Software License Agreements: The degree to which the terms and conditions of the proposed Software and/or Hardware license agreement(s) align(s) with Federal law and complies with section H. The degree to which the license agreement does not limit the Government's ability to maintain or upgrade the system by the Government (and its' support Contractors). The degree to which the type of annual license proposed (enterprise, user, site, etc.) is beneficial to the Government in terms of cost and ability to meet mission and technical requirements.

M.3.4-FACTOR 2: Past Performance The Government will evaluate the Offeror's and (if applicable) major subcontractor's and/or major teaming partner's past performance based on a two-step process. The first step will evaluate the relevancy and recency of the past performance information. The results of the relevancy and recency evaluation will then be evaluated for Confidence in Future Success. Major subcontractors and major teaming partners are defined as supplying 25% or more of the proposed work to be performed. The Past Performance evaluation will be based on the degree to which the Contract descriptions, Past Performance Questionnaires, and other past performance information indicate: Page 111 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management



Relevance (STEP 1) The degree to which the Offeror's and Major subcontractor's past performance demonstrates relevant/recent experience compared to this project in terms of similar size, scope, and complexity. The degree to which the Offeror's and Major subcontractor's past performance demonstrates a similar technical environment (defined as the deployment and use of your ICM system in an investigative law enforcement environment). If the experience described by the Offeror required subcontracting or other external resource usage, these relationships must be clearly explained and quantified. Confidence in Future Success (STEP 2): The degree to which the Offeror's and Major subcontractor's recent and relevant past and present performance predicts successful future performance for this project. The degree to which the Offeror consistently delivers quality services and products in a timely and cost-effective manner on relevant/recent projects. If the Offeror lacks a record of recent/relevant past performance, it will receive a Neutral past performance rating.



M.3.5-FACTOR 3: Business and Price The Offeror's Business & Price proposal will not receive an adjectival rating. The Offeror's business & price proposal will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404-1(b). In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(c)(1), the Government anticipates there to be adequate price competition to establish a fair and reasonable price. However, the Government may also use one or more of the technique's outlined in FAR 15.404-1(b) to ensure a fair and reasonable price. For purposes of determining the best value, the evaluated price will be the sum of the base year and all five (5) options periods. The price proposal will also be compared to the Basis of Estimate in the Technical Approach for consistency and understanding of the contract requirements. Price will not be scored, however it will be considered a factor in the best value determination. Proposals will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness as follows: ˇ ˇ Completeness: All information/data required by the RFP has been submitted, tracks to the requirements, and supports the proposal. Reasonableness: Prices are considered fair under current market conditions and reasonable to the Government.

Each price will be validated by examining the arithmetic accuracy and consistency of the information presented in the proposal. Discrepancies will be noted and provided to the Source Selection Authority and Contracting Officer. Each CLIN price will be evaluated as follows: CLIN XX01 (Proof of Concept and Labor for IOC, Transition-In and Transition-Out)Offerors shall provide a firm-fixed price (FFP) in addition to the Level of Effort (LOE)

Page 112 of 117

HSCETC-14-R-00002: ICE Investigative Case Management

required to support the FFP being proposed. The Price will be evaluated as follows: Total FFP for each period of performance. CLINs XX02 (ICM Software License)- Offerors shall provide a unit, number of units, unit price and total FFP for the ICM Software License. The Price will be evaluated as follows: Proposed Number of Units X Unit Price=Total FFP CLINs XX03 (Other Direct Costs)- The Offeror shall provide a NTE amount in addition to a detailed cost estimate for hardware/ additional software regardless of whether it is listed on the ICE TRM. The Price will be evaluated as follows: Total proposed NTE amount. CLINs XX04 (Travel)- No additional documentation is needed as the Government has provided NTE amounts for travel. The NTE price will not be evaluated since it was provided by the Government but will be included in the evaluated price. CLINs XX05 (Operations and Maintenance)- Offerors shall provide a monthly unit price and total FFP in addition to the Level of Effort (LOE) required to support the FFP being proposed. The Price will be evaluated as follows: Proposed Unit Price X Number of Units (provided by Government) CLIN XX06 (Option System Enhancements)- The Offeror shall provide the labor rates for the labor categories/descriptions provided by the Government in Attachment 6-CLIN Structure. The Government has provided the number of hours for each labor category. The Price will be evaluated as follows: Sum of the NTE amount for CLIN XX06 which is the sum of all NTE amounts of the labor categories: The NTE amount for each Labor Category will be calculated as follows: Set number of hours (provided by the Government) X Hourly Rate (provided by the Offeror). CLIN XX07 (Hosting)-Offerors shall provide a unit price, number of units, and total FFP in addition to the LOE requirement to support the FFP being proposed. The Price will be evaluated as follows: Proposed Unit Price X Number of Units The sum of the base and all option periods will determine the total evaluated price. The Government may require the submission of cost or pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403 if, after receipt of proposals, such a determination is made. Affirmation and Completion of Exhibit A-ICE/HSI Investigative Case Management System Requirements-LES The Offeror's completion of Exhibit A-ICE/HSI Investigative Case Management System Requirements-LES and statement of affirmation regarding their understanding and intention to fulfill those full system requirements will be examined to verify they comply with the instructions. This will assist in assessing the risk of selecting the Offeror's proposed solution.

Small Business Subcontracting PlanThe Government will evaluate each Offeror's socioeconomic status using information provided by the Offeror and the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to determine whether the Offeror is a large business or a small business under NAICS 561612. The Government will evaluate each large businesses' Subcontracting Plan based on the information provided to determine what extent the Offeror meets the ICE established subcontracting goals as follows: (f) Small Business (SB) concerns: 45% (g) HUBZone concerns: (3%) (h) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns: (3%) (i) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns: (5%) (j) Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns: (5%) The proposed participation in the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program will be evaluated to determine if the Offeror possesses a signed mentor-protégé agreement from the DHS OSDBU. Subcontracting plans will be deemed acceptable or unacceptable. AssumptionsThe Government will review the explanation/justification for assumptions of costs that are not identified elsewhere in the proposal for reasonableness and understanding of the requirements. M.3.6-STEP 1 ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITIONS Each Operational Capabilities Demonstration will be assigned one of the following adjectival ratings:
ADJECTIVAL RATING Very Likely to be a Viable Competitor in Step 2 DEFINITION The Offeror's proposed system demonstrates significant existing ("out of the box") capabilities to meet the requirements of the OCD. The Offeror is highly likely to submit a competitive Step 2 written proposal. The Offeror's proposed system demonstrates reasonable ("out of the box") capabilities to meet the requirements of the OCD. The Offeror may be likely to submit a competitive Step 2 written proposal. The Offeror's proposed system does not demonstrate adequate existing ("out of the box") capabilities to meet the requirements of the OCD. The Offeror is not likely to submit a competitive Step 2 written proposal.

M.3.7-STEP 2 ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITIONS FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL Factor 1 (Technical) will be evaluated at the sub-factor level and will include a listing of Significant Strengths, Strengths, Weaknesses, and Deficiencies; Sub-Factor 1-Technical Approach is more important than Factor 2-Management Approach. The Government will assign an adjectival rating for each of the sub-factors. Based on the evaluations of the sub-factors, the Government will also assign an overall adjectival rating for Factor 1; the overall adjectival rating for Factor 1 will be a "roll-up" of the sub-factor ratings. The following rating definitions will be utilized in the evaluation of the Technical sub-factors:
Significant Strength, Strength, Weakness, Deficiency DEFINITION A Significant Strength is an aspect of the proposal that significantly enhances the merit of a proposal or significantly exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be significantly advantageous to the Government during contract performance and increases the probability of successful contract performance A Strength is an aspect of the proposal that exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance and increases the likelihood of successful contract performance A Weakness is defined as a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance A Significant Weakness is a flaw in the proposal that appreciable increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance

Significant Strength

Strength

Weakness

Significant Weakness

Deficiency

A Deficiency is defined as an aspect of the proposal that fails to meet a Government requirement or a combination of weaknesses in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level

ADJECTIVAL RATING

DEFINITION A comprehensive and thorough proposal of exceptional merit with one or more significant strengths. No deficiency exists. Has no known potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal Contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties. A proposal having no deficiency and which demonstrates overall competence. One or more strengths have been found and strengths outweigh any weaknesses that exist. Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal Contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties.

ADJECTIVAL RATING

DEFINITION A proposal having no deficiency and which shows a reasonably sound response. There may be strengths or weaknesses, or both. As a whole, weaknesses not off-set by strengths do not significantly detract from the Offeror's response. Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special Contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties. A proposal that may or may not have one or more deficiencies and demonstrates some understanding in the response. There may be strengths or weaknesses, or both. As a whole, weaknesses not off-set by strengths significantly detract from the Offeror's resp onse. Can potentially cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may or may not be acceptable with special Contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring. A proposal that has one or more deficiencies that demonstrate a lack of overall competence or would require a major proposal revision to correct. Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special Contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.
