2.1 Background The National Information Technology Center (NITC) is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). The mission of NITC is to enable Government agencies to achieve their missions by providing innovative, cost effective, and secure information technology solutions. The NITC provides information management services and technology to support the missions of the USDA and its agencies, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), General Services Administration (GSA), and other Government clients. NITC headquarters is located in Kansas City, Missouri, with employees also stationed in Fort Collins, Colorado, St. Louis, Missouri, and Washington D.C. The NITC is a centralized computing facility of mainframe and mid-range platforms, software and support. NITC customers access their services from remote locations throughout the continental United States via private and public networks. NITC's computing facility of mainframe and mid range platforms, software and support represents leading edge capability, consistency, and reliability. The applications that run in the NITC environment are national in scope and importance, directly serving approximately 70,000 end users. The NITC works closely with customers to provide the technical resources, the expertise and the processing environments critical to their applications. NITC's primary production facility is located at 8930 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, Missouri, and disaster recovery facility is located at 4300 Goodfellow Boulevard, Bldg 104, in St. Louis, Missouri.

2.2 Statement of Work USDA requires service for the maintenance of EMC Equipment at the USDA National Information Technology Center's (NITC) Data Centers. Services are to be provided by EMC Authorized Resellers Only. LOCATIONS (codes, description, address) NITC KCMO: 8930 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, MO, 64114 NITC GoodFellow: Building 104 Second Floor, OCIO/NITC Computer Room, 4300 Goodfellow Blvd, St. Louis MO 63120 NITC SLC: 2222 W 2300 S., Salt Lake City, UT 84119 - 2020 NITC Fort Collins: 2150 Centre Dr., Building A, Ft Collins, CO 80526 NITC Ft. Worth: 509 W. Felix St. Bldg. 23 Fort Worth, TX 76115

Tasks to be Performed: Machine service response shall be 24 x 7 x 4, provided access site is available with necessary USDA on site support. Hardware maintenance shall include disk retention for all covered items. The contractor shall reconcile inventories of the above NITC Data Centers against the existing EMC equipment inventory that is not on an existing USDA contract or lease, including the current status of warranty and maintenance levels, verification of equipment serial numbers, assigned service levels, and end of service life status. The contractor shall develop a comprehensive system for the tracking of covered EMC equipment warranties so that the systems which are ending their respective warranty periods can be added to the Maintenance Services Contract in a timely manner. The contractor will identify and review the current EMC Call Center procedures for incoming service calls from NITC personnel, paying special attention to established EMC protocols for managing nonstandard calls (i.e., covered hardware or software not listed in the EMC database or equipment that is flagged for non-payment of Maintenance Services invoices, resulting in NITC calls being significantly delayed when referred to Entitlement Verification, and so on). Once completed, the contractor will

Page 6 of 36

USDA RFQ No. AG-3142-S-12-0003

ask the NITC to identify and possibly allow the contractor to interview end users who have had actual experience with the EMC Call Center. The contractor shall develop a procedure with NITC staff to coordinate the deletion of covered EMC equipment from NITC service and the removal of the units from the Maintenance Services Contract. The contractor shall implement an internal billing review process intended to provide validated invoices for maintenance services to the NITC. Should an invoice require any change in the amount billed due to modifications of NITC inventory, the contractor will identify the changes and seek approval for the revised invoice as a component to the billing review process. It should be the contractor's intention to develop an expedited review and approval process with the NITC in order to assure prompt billing and payment of submitted invoices. The maintenance period shall align with the performance period above, which aligns with the USDA Fiscal Year (FY). When support for a new device commences after October 1 (e.g., beginning in the period after any warranty expires), the annual period shall be prorated by the number of months remaining in the contract year, beginning with the 1st day of the month in which support commences. (Example: November 28, 2011 = 10/12 year with a hardware maintenance period of December 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The following year maintenance period would be for the full year October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013.) Any End-of-service-life dates known to USDA are listed in the notes column of the spreadsheet. Services are not requested after the End-of-service-life has been reached. If the End-of-Service-life occurs during the period of performance (10/01/11 to 9/30/12) then the services should be prorated from the October 1, 2011 to the end-of-service-life date.

The Contractor shall submit timely and accurate invoices to NITC for services. The Contractor shall invoice only for the work and/or unique services or equipment ordered by the Government and actually used in direct support of this Statement of Work. The USDA fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30 each year. Invoices must be billed against nd, the order under which the services were performed (e.g., work performed on September 22 2011, must be billed on the FY11 order). Expenses cannot be carried over to the next fiscal year. The Contractor shall invoice all expenses for the fiscal year within 30 calendar days of the end of that USDA fiscal year. Invoices found to be incomplete or inaccurate shall be returned to the Contractor and will cause payment delays.

[List as necessary] (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

Page 16 of 36

USDA RFQ No. AG-3142-S-12-0003

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment . A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product ___________________ ___________________ Listed Countries of Origin ___________________ ___________________

(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies. ] [ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that-- (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Section 5- Section 508 - Accessibility of Electronic and Information Technology (a) This RFP is subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) as amended by the workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220). Specifically, subsection 508(a)(1) requires that when the Federal Government procures Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), the EIT must allow Federal employees and individuals of the public with disabilities comparable access to and use of information and data that is provided to Federal employees and individuals of the public without disabilities. (b) The EIT accessibility standards at 36 CFR Part 1194 were developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board ("Access Board") and apply to contracts and task/delivery orders, awarded under indefinite quantity contracts on or after June 25, 2001. (c) Each Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) product or service furnished under this contract shall comply with the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards (36 CFR 1194), as specified in the contract, as a minimum. If the Contracting Officer determines any furnished product or service is not in compliance with the contract, the Contracting Officer will promptly inform the Contractor in writing. The Contractor shall, without charge to the Government, repair or replace the non-compliant products or services within the period of time to be specified by the Government in writing. If such repair or replacement is not completed within the time specified, the Government shall have the following recourses: 1. Cancellation of the contract, delivery or task order, purchase or line item without termination liabilities; or 2. In the case of custom Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) being developed by a contractor for the Government, the Government shall have the right to have any necessary changes made or repairs performed by itself or by another firm for the noncompliant EIT, with the contractor liable for reimbursement to the Government for any expenses incurred thereby. (d) The contractor must ensure that all EIT products that are less than fully compliant with the accessibility standards are provided pursuant to extensive market research and are the most current compliant products or services available to satisfy the contract requirements. (e) For every EIT product or service accepted under this contact by the Government that does not comply with 36 CFR 1194, the contractor shall, at the discretion of the Government, make every effort to replace or upgrade it with a compliant equivalent product or service, if commercially available and cost neutral, on either a contract specified refresh cycle for the product or service, or on a contract effective option/renewal date; whichever shall occur first.
