DOL110RQ21145 ­ Requirements Matrix U.S. Department of Labor Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution Solicitation

INTRODUCTION / BACKGROUND The OASAM IT Security Office under the direction of the Department of Labor (DOL), Office of the Assistance Secretary for the Administration and Management (OASAM) serves as the IT Security function to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Department of Labor's information and information systems. This is accomplished through the different facets of the OASAM IT Security program which directly supports the Department' s overall information security program. T h ea g e n c yh a sas e c u r i t yi n i t i a t i v et oe x p a n do nt h ea g e n c y ' ss e c u r i t yo p e r a t i o n s including threat and risk management, incident response capabilities, and to address regulatory compliance reporting requirements. OASAM would like to purchase and deploy a network-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution which incorporates SIM (security information management) and SEM (security event management) technologies. The solution will provide the agency with capabilities to address the identified requirements (see requirement section) in addition to providing real-time monitoring, analysis, and historical reporting of security events from network end points. The SIEM t o o lw i l la d d r e s st h ea g e n c y ' ss e c u r i t yw e a k n e s s e sf o rc o m p l i a n c er e p o r t i n g ,l o g management, and threat management.

SCOPE The purpose of this request is to procure a SIEM solution to m e e tt h ea g e n c y ' s requirements. SIEM REQUIREMENTS
