BACKGROUND
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and a range of programs designed to reduce future losses to homes, businesses, schools, public buildings and critical facilities from floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. FEMA focuses on breaking the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repeated damage. Mitigation efforts initiated by FEMA provide value to the American people by creating safer communities and reducing loss of life and damage to property. A partial list of mitigation activities includes those listed in Table 1.

Mitigation Activities of the NFIP
       Acquiring damaged homes or businesses in flood-prone areas, relocating the structures, and returning the property to open space, wetlands or recreational uses Adopting zoning ordinances that steer development away from areas subject to flooding, storm surge or coastal erosion Building community shelters and tornado safe rooms to help protect people in their homes, public buildings and schools in hurricane- and tornado-prone areas Complying with or exceeding NFIP Floodplain Management Regulations Educating communities on how they can reduce their vulnerability to natural hazard events Enforcing building codes, flood-proofing requirements, seismic design standards and wind-bracing requirements for new construction or repairing existing buildings Retrofitting public buildings to withstand hurricane-strength winds or earthquakes

Table 1 Mitigation Activities of the NFIP

FEMA's Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) is committed to improving the NFIP by enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness of operation through well-defined strategic business priorities, enabled by well thought out business processes. To accomplish this, constant review and improvement of processes that support the NFIP are needed. Similarly, FEMA desires to utilize the most appropriate Information Technology (IT) capabilities which should be flexible and responsive in ways that help the NFIP reduce costs in processing policies across the program.

SCOPE
FEMA is responsible for administering the WYO program, which includes NFIP operating policies, establishing rates, designating eligible communities, developing reporting requirements, and creating auditing specifications. There are approximately 5.6 million NFIP policies in force, with over $1.25 trillion of coverage in force. These policies are sold and serviced through over 80 private PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 13

Statement of Work National Flood Insurance Program IT Systems and Support insurance companies participating in the WYO program, all of whom must report every transaction to the NFIP. The WYO companies are the primary vehicle for selling, delivering and servicing flood insurance policies, and they are responsible for approximately 75% of NFIP policies in force. The WYO companies have been invaluable in the NFIP's effort to increase the flood insurance policy base, increase the geographic distribution of policyholders, improve service to policyholders as well as insurance agents, and enhance the NFIP's ability to settle claims promptly and fairly in post-catastrophe environments. FEMA requires a contractor, hereinafter referred to as "Contractor," to provide program management, insurance services, financial services, and System of Record (SOR) operations, maintenance, and support services of the legacy IT system environment, all in support of the NFIP. This means that FEMA requires a wide array of business and IT services. The Contractor serves as a point of contact and provides support for the Write Your Own (WYO) program and NFIP Direct Servicing Agent (DSA). A Monthly Technical Progress Narrative (MTPN) created by the Contractor provides a comprehensive report of the previous month's activities and provides valuable information to FIMA management. In addition to the services listed above, the Contractor is a source of information for the WYO insurance companies and the DSA contractor as they work to provide the information required by the NFIP. The Contractor will also engage in support activities that include tracking, collecting, disseminating, maintaining, and updating information on the NFIP and the WYO companies. The Contractor must reconcile the policy details and produce accurate reports to ensure the financial integrity of the program; this involves about $3.2 billion in annual premium collections that must be accurately accounted for. FEMA undertakes these responsibilities in cooperation with participating NFIP communities and the insurance industry. The Contractor establishes catastrophe and coordination field offices in the event of large scale or severe flooding. These offices are set up to expedite claims and coordinate WYO activities. Also, through a central office and field offices, the Contractor supports NFIP outreach through coordination with FEMA's Regional Offices. The work that the Contractor will perform will be UNCLASSIFIED. It should be noted that a substantial amount of data is considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and must be treated as such.

CONSTRAINTS
The NFIP's SOR is both distributed and mainframe based with web based access and reporting, and it has been the NFIP's SOR for over 30 years. The Contractor shall operate and maintain the NFIP's SOR as it is currently configured, described and defined in this SOW. All data, licensed software, hand coded software and ancillary systems are owned by FEMA and are transferable to subsequent NFIP contractors.

Statement of Work National Flood Insurance Program IT Systems and Support The Contractor shall not be inhibited from using software and other related materials which it has developed prior to this contract for its own management tools and for which it retains exclusive proprietary rights. However, such use is subject to prior approval by FEMA and any modifications to these materials that are required to make them applicable to and useable by the SOR shall not be undertaken as direct cost of this contract without prior authorization of the Contracting Officer (CO). Said authorization may, at the election of FEMA, also require license or sale to FEMA of the modified software at an agreed upon price.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
SYNOPSIS: This SOW and other documents such as manuals, technical bulletins, brochures and other publications referenced in the SOW are provided in the Bidders Library. The location of this library will be provided by the CO. The Department of Homeland Security Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A (DHS 4300A) is the official document relating to Departmental standards and guidelines adopted and promulgated under the provisions of DHS Management Directive 140-01 (MD 140-01) Information Technology System Security. MD 140-01 serves as a foundation for DHS organizational elements to use in establishing IT security programs within their organizations and clarifies national policies, adapts them to specific circumstances, and imposes additional requirements when necessary. DHS 4300A identifies procedures for implementing all applicable policies. DHS policies: DHS 4300A policies delineate the security management structure and foundation to measure progress and compliance. Policies in DHS 4300A document are organized under three areas, management, operational, and technical. Management Controls ­ Focus on managing both the IT security system and system risk. These controls consist of risk mitigation techniques and concerns normally addressed by management. Operational Controls ­ Focus on mechanisms primarily implemented and executed by people. These controls are designed to improve the security of a particular system, or group of systems. These controls require technical or specialized expertise and often rely on management and technical controls. Technical Controls ­ Focus on security controls executed by IT systems. These controls provide automated protection from unauthorized access or misuse. They facilitate detection of security violations, and support security requirements for applications and data. The Contractor is responsible for the implementation of the policies articulated in DHS 4300A and is required to inform the COR of any deviation from the policies stated therein. Such communication does not release the Contractor of any of its responsibilities as described within the SOW. PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 15

The documents referenced in Table 3 are current as of the publication of this SOW. The Contractor is responsible for monitoring the changes to each of these documents as they pertain to this SOW and providing impact assessments to the COR when there is a change to any of these documents.

SOW OVERVIEW AND GENERAL COMMENTS
SYNOPSIS: This overview is intended to provide a summary look at the SOW. Specifically, Sections 1-40 provide details for the major functions that need to be provided by the Contractor. Where applicable, these sections contain tables that further define the support requirements for that section. Section 42 contains a comprehensive set of tables each of which provides a detailed list of functions that further define the specific task elements required by the Contractor. It is left to the Contractor to establish the appropriate correlation between Sections 1-40 and the tables in Section 43. BIGGERT-WATERS FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2012 AND HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2014: The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 (BW-12) had two (2) major purposes. First, it reauthorized the NFIP for a five (5) year period that ends on September 30, 2017. Second, it provided for significant changes in the structure of the NFIP over this five (5) year period. The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act repeals and modifies certain provision of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act but continues to work toward financial stability for the NFIP while also considering affordability for policyholders. Both acts make significant program changes of which the contractor must be aware and ready to implement FEMA-directed changes. The importance of these acts with respect to this SOW is that the Contractor will need to take into account that these structural modifications will have potentially significant impacts in terms of changes to existing requirements in this SOW as well as entirely new requirements that are not reflected in this SOW. In some cases, the NFIP is still analyzing requirements and working with internal and external stakeholders to develop implementation plans. This information is provided to identify for the Contractor that there will be changes to the scope of work over the period of performance. The changes that have been implemented by the award date or other such date as determined by FEMA are included in this SOW.

BIGGERT-WATERS FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2012 AND HOMEOWNER FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2014

SYNOPSIS: The U.S. Congress established the NFIP on August 1, 1968, with the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act (NFIA). The program was subsequently modified by other legislative measures such as the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, the National Flood Insurance Reform Act (NFIRA) of 1994, and the Flood Insurance Reform Act (FIRA) of 2004. More recently, Congress passed significant flood insurance reform legislation on June 29, 2012, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2012 (BW-12), which reauthorized the National Flood Insurance Program for a five year period that ends on September 30, 2017 and improved the financial underpinnings of the program. In 2014, Congress passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act (HFIAA) to work toward financial stability for the NFIP while also considering affordability for policyholders. The NFIP's current authorization to operate expires in 2017, and it can be assumed that requests for data and information about the program will increase during the Congressional reauthorization process before that time. The regulations governing the NFIP are set forth in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Subchapter B, commencing at Part 59. The authority for the WYO Program as set forth in 44 CFR Parts 61 and 62, Sections 61.13 and 62.63. Appendix B to Part 62 establishes A Plan to Maintain Financial Control for Business Written Under the Write Your Own Program (Financial Control Plan). BW-12 and HFIAA included changes to address shortfalls in the NFIP's financing that required insurance rate increases and the collection of monies for a Reserve Fund, the result being that policyholders are being asked to pay more for their flood insurance. Needless to say, the higher rates have raised the visibility of the NFIP's insurance program, made the program the subject of media headlines across the country, and increased Congressional scrutiny of the program. More than ever in the NFIP's history there is a strong need for streamlined contractor support to assist FEMA with the 2012 and 2014 legislation, provisions of which will require many years to implement. Most importantly the NFIP's PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 21

Statement of Work National Flood Insurance Program IT Systems and Support national visibility, which has increased since the enactment of BW-12 and HFIAA, has reinforced the need for seamless contractor operational support. Both pieces of legislation will impact National Flood Insurance Program operations. BW-12 alone has forty (40) provisions including numerous studies which will fundamentally change the operations of the NFIP. Areas of particular impact are in Table 5

BW Key Provisions and Studies






  

Affordability Study -- depending on the outcome, FEMA could be required to means test for premium assistance; this testing will need the support of the Contractor and will require coordination with WYO companies. Alternative Loss Allocation -- the program will require a methodology to determine what percentage of a wind and water loss is attributed to wind damage compared to water damage. A centralized database could be required in order to issue the determination on a per claims basis. Flood in Progress -- which will require the contractor to notify the public in a timely manner as to when a flood has commenced or is in progress for the purposes of flood insurance coverage. Grandfathering, when implemented -- will require very specific property information in a single place to rate flood insurance policies Negative Elevation Rates -- the program will have to start collecting information and possibly maintain an elevation certificate database in order to properly rate structures since the pre-FIRM subsidy will be eliminated.

Table 5 BW Key Provisions and Studies

HFIAA requires gradual rate increases to properties receiving subsidized rates and individual premium increases are capped at 18 percent for most properties, with some exceptions. HFIAA repeals a provision of BW which required FEMA, upon the effective date of a new or updated Flood Insurance Rate Map, to phase in premium increases over five years by 20% per year. Rather HFIAA requires that these rates be phase in by 5 to 15 percent per year. The law also requires FEMA to prepare a draft affordability framework, including proposals for ensuring flood insurance affordability among low income populations. Table 6 lists the sections of both pieces of legislation that have an anticipated impact on the NFIP. The impact includes modifying business processes, modifying IT systems, doing analyses and providing communications.

Table 32 Hardware and Software Cross Reference

The NFIP owns the Distributed hardware that supports the distributed and web based applications. The NFIP does not own the mainframe hardware that runs its legacy systems, choosing instead to purchase the MIPS it needs as appropriate. The Contractor shall plan a migration of all Government-owned hardware and software to a FEMA approved datacenter. The response to the proposal must include a high level draft plan that demonstrates the Contractor's ability to successfully execute this migration. A detailed migration plan shall have a target completion date within forty five (45) days of the award date and which provides a 15 day period for review by FEMA. Neither migration plan is part of the Transition-In plan but the detailed migration plan is expected to be referenced in the Transition-In plan. The detailed migration plan must be successfully executed within seven (7) months of its acceptance by FEMA. The NFIP IT legacy system services to be provided for the mainframe and distributed environments shall minimally include those listed in Computing Resources 43-3 on page 93. The Contractor shall execute the plan upon acceptance of said plan by FEMA.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT (NFIP ITS&S)
To provide systems and support services to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and its stakeholders. The contractor will be required to adhere to the guidelines described herein.

PURPOSE
This Government's Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate contractor actions while implementing the Statement of Work (SOW) for the National Flood Insurance Program Information Technology Systems and Support contract (NFIP ITS&S). It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed requirement of the SOW. The QASP explains: what will be monitored, how monitoring will take place, who will conduct the monitoring, and how monitoring efforts and results will be documented. This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in operating, maintaining, and providing the service with the best means of achieving this objective. The contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government in quality assurance is to ensure contract standards are achieved and to provide an effective surveillance method to monitor the contractor's performance relative to the requirements listed in the agreement. The QASP illustrates the systematic method the Government (or its designated representative) will use to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish. The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions and to document its approach in a Quality Control Plan (QCP). The contractor's QCP, upon approval by the Government, will be made a part of the resulting contractual agreement. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the QCP provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success. Once the QCP is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program. This QASP is a "living document" and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis. However, the Government shall coordinate changes with the contractor. Updates shall ensure that the QASP remains a valid, useful, and enforceable document. Copies of the original QASP and revisions shall be provided to the contractor and Government officials implementing surveillance activities.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN GOVERNMENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The following personnel shall oversee and coordinate surveillance activities: a. Contracting Officer (CO) - The CO shall ensure performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensure compliance with the contract terms, and shall safeguard the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. The CO shall also assure that the contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under this contract. The CO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the contractor's performance. Assigned CO: Carolyn Ward Organization or Agency: Federal Emergency Management Agency Telephone: 202.646.4654 Email: Carolyn. Ward@fema.dhs.gov
b. Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) - The COR is responsible for technical

administration of the contract and shall assure proper Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR shall keep a quality assurance file. At the conclusion of the contract or when requested by the CO, the contractor shall provide documentation to the CO that details the surveillance conducted and the results. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. The contractor shall refer any changes they deem may affect contract price, terms, or conditions to the CO for action. Assigned COR: TBD Telephone: Email:

QUALITY CONTROL PLAN

As a part of its agreement with the Government, the contractor is required to develop, implement, and maintain a Quality Control Plan (QCP) that illustrates the methods it will use to review its performance to ensure it conforms to the performance requirements. See Attachment 1: Performance Requirements Summary for performance objectives which will be reviewed by the Government. The contractor should also perform such reviews in order to validate its operations and assure the Government that the services meet the performance standards. The contractor's QCP should include monitoring methods that ensure and demonstrate its compliance with the performance standards. This includes inspection methods and schedules that are consistent with the regular reviews conducted by the government. The reports and other results generated by the contractor's QCP activities should be provided to the COR as requested. The frequency and type of the contractor's reviews should be consistent with what is necessary in order to ensure compliance with the performance standards, but no less frequent than what PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 2

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
is described in the Statement of Work and the Government's Performance Monitoring Tool (See Attachment 2). The contractor is encouraged not to limit its inspection to only the processes outlined in the Government's standard; however, certain key documents must be provided by the contractor to assure the Government that the services meet the performance standards. Listed below is a partial list of the documentation that must be generated and made available to the COR for inspection. The list is intended as illustrative and is not all-inclusive. The contractor must develop and implement a program that addresses the specific requirement of each standard and the means it will use to document compliance. ˇ Written policies and procedures to implement and assess operational requirements of the standard ˇ Documentation and recording keeping that ensure ongoing operational compliance with the standards (e.g.; inventories, logbooks, register of receipts, reports, etc.) ˇ Staff training records ˇ Investigative reports ˇ Medical records ˇ Records of investigative actions taken ˇ Equipment inspections ˇ System tests and evaluation

METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE
The Contracting Officer Representative (COR) or their designee will survey the appropriate work of the contractor and observe the contractor performing the tasks or review documentation, as appropriate. The COR or his or her designee will conduct evaluations of all of items identified in the below Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) in a manner consistent with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, or any other method at the COR's discretion. The COR may receive input through customer feedback as well as NFIP personnel and other Government personnel. Contractor performance will be surveyed to determine if it meets the contract standards. A variety of surveillance methods may be used. Random Sampling FEMA may conduct random sampling when the COR or designated FEMA representatives samples services to determine if the level of performance is acceptable based on a statistically random sample. Periodic Inspection of the Processes or Output FEMA shall conduct monthly reviews either of reports or at the contractor's site; FEMA may conduct periodic inspections when the COR or designated FEMA representative chooses the location and time to conduct surveillance in other than a statistically random manner.

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
Stakeholder Feedback FEMA may use validated stakeholder feedback as the basis for actions against the contractor; other FEMA employees and WYO companies are considered stakeholders to this contract.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
Performance of a service will be evaluated to determine whether or not it meets the performance requirements of the contract. When the performance requirement is not met, the Contracting Officer will issue a Discrepancy Report (DR) to the contractor. The Discrepancy Report is drafted by the COR, who forwards it to the Contracting Officer. The contractor shall respond to the Discrepancy Report by completing the appropriate blocks of the form and returning it to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of receipt. Upon evaluation of the contractor's response to a Discrepancy Response the contractor's payment for the month in which the performance in question occurred will be calculated as stated in the contractor payment section. In the case of Discrepancy Reports issued as the result of other methods of surveillance, the Contracting Officer shall take appropriate measures according to the clause entitled "Inspection of Services."

RATINGS
Metrics and methods are designed to determine if performance exceeds, meets, or does not meet a given standard and acceptable quality level. A rating scale shall be used to determine a positive, neutral, or negative outcome. The following ratings shall be used:
EXCEEDED: MET: UNMET:

Performance significantly exceeds contract requirements to the Government's benefit. Performance meets contractual requirements. Performance does not meet contractual requirements.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN Attachment 1: PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY (PRS)
Performance Objective: Lists the performance objectives that the Government will survey. The absence of any contract requirement from the QASP shall not detract from its enforceability to limit the rights or remedies of the Government under any other provisions of the contract, including the clauses entitled "Inspection of Services" and "Default." Required Service: Defines the standard of performance for each listed objective. Performance Standard: Sets forth the minimum allowable deviation from the standard performance which may occur before the Government will invoke the payment computation formula for an incentive; and/or sets forth the maximum deviation from the standard performance before the Government will invoke the payment computation formula for the disincentive. The column has alpha-bullets which correspond to bullets of the same in Column 5 (Performance Incentive/Disincentive). Method of Surveillance: Sets forth the surveillance methods the Government will use to evaluate the contractor's performance for the listed tasks. This column also establishes the period of planned surveillance. Performance Incentive/Disincentive: Sets forth the performance evaluation area percentage weighting that the listed contract requirements represents.

____________________________________________________________________________________ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.02 per hour or $160.80 per week or $696.79 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer

http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-2103.txt?v=14

10/31/2014

Page 8 of 10

occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-2103.txt?v=14

10/31/2014

Page 9 of 10

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

10/31/2014

Page 10 of 10

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

Task 5.0 Pricing Scenario The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is tracking a storm that exited the northwestern coast of Africa on August 8, 2014, and the circulation center is well defined. The storm is anticipated to strengthen to hurricane force and projected to impact the east coast if it remains on its current track. On August 15, 2014, NHC announced the storm strengthened to Category III, with sustained winds of 125 mph, (intensity on the Saffir­Simpson scale) and classified a major hurricane. If the storm remains on its current path; the storm will lash the east coast with high waves, major coastal flooding, severe damage to infrastructure, residential and commercial buildings and communications will be impacted. Businesses and residents are warned to prepare for the onslaught of this major storm and evacuations are mandatory along the east coast. Within the past 24-hours the NHC announced the hurricane will remain on its projected track with extreme intensification to a Category IV, and sustained winds of 152 mph making landfall at Hialeah, Florida with winds extending as far inland as Hernando County. The current path of the storm will track up the east coast from Florida to Maine. This storm is dangerous and evacuations are mandatory, the storm will intensify and lose strength as it tracks up the coast, but will cause major wind and flood damage to buildings and infrastructure ˇ FEMA is in a state of readiness and have activated the NRCC and FEMA Regional Offices, etc. FEMA works in conjunction with their contractors who are required to respond and report to FEMA, how will this be accomplished with a storm of this magnitude affecting eleven states.

Before delivery to and acceptance by the Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. If any property is lost (see 45.101), the basis of payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.

52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed
PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 51

tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 52

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Provision)

NOTICE OF FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY PROTESTS A. Preface Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties must use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party. FEMA offers, as an option for dispute resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). ADR in an informal, expeditious and inexpensive way to resolve contract issues and is designed to promote satisfying solutions and fair procedures. For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address: Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA ADR Office Office of Alternative Dispute Resolution 4000 Virginia Ave. Washington, DC 20472 If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency. These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest. Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103. B. Definitions. (1) "Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the contracting officer. (2) "Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the contracting officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest. Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman. (3) "Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday. Similarly, when
PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 60

the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open. C. Submission Guidelines. (1) Agency protests may be filed through the contracting officer or, at the level above the contracting officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows: a. Protests filed through the contracting officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed or faxed to: DHS/FEMA/OCPO/LOG Attn: Carolyn Ward, Contracting Officer 395E Street, S.W., (519/W80) Washington, DC 20472 202-646-3318 -OR-

DHS/FEMA/OCPO/AOD Attn: Anthony Martoccia, Director, Acquisition Operations Division 395E Streets, SW-Room 526 Washington, DC 20472-3205 Anthony.Martoccia@fema.dhs.gov b. The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest". c. If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible contracting officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested). (2) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. (3) Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided: A. the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number; B. the solicitation or contract number; C. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced; D. copies of relevant documents;
PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 61

E. a request for ruling by the agency; F. a statement detailing the form of relief requested; G. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and H. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest. (4) All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman. D. Timeliness/Resolution of Protests. (1) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation. (2) Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held. (3) Protests filed through the contracting officer. a. Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the contracting officer, the contracting officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)". b. Appeals. i. Protesters who filed protests through the contracting officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the contracting officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman. ii. Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested). iii. The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision.

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 62

iv. In accordance with FAR 33.103(d)(4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a)(3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. (4) Protests filed through the Ombudsman: a. If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed. b. Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency. E. Dismissal of Protests. The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails to clearly state legally sufficient grounds of protest). 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998) This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

RESTRICTION ON USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PROPOSAL AND QUOTATION INFORMATION (DATA) The information (data) contained in all Sections of this proposal or quotation constitutes a trade secret and/or information that are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged. It is furnished to the government in confidence with the understanding that it will not, without permission of the Offeror, by used or disclosed for other than evaluation purposes; provided, however, that in the event a contract is awarded on the basis of this proposal or quotation the government shall have the right to use and disclose this information (data) to the extent provided in the contract. This restriction does not limit the government's right to use or disclose this information (data) if obtained from another source without restriction. HSAR 3052.209-72 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (DEC 2003) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will award contracts only to those offerors whose objectivity is not impaired by conflicting interests. Based on this policy(a) The offeror shall provide a statement in its proposal which describes in a concise manner all past, present or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an organization whose interests may be substantially affected by Departmental activities, and which is related to the work under this solicitation.

Past interest shall be limited to within one year of the date of the offeror's technical proposal. Key personnel, for purposes of this clause, shall include any person owning more than 20% interest in the company, and the company's corporate officers, its senior managers and any employees responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a regulated or affected organization.

The offeror must obtain the same information from potential subcontractors prior to award of a subcontract. (d) The contracting officer will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the offeror. All such information, and any other relevant information known to DHS, will be used to determine whether an award to the offeror may create a conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the contracting officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. (e) The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information required, may result in disqualification of the offeror for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If, after award, the contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to the contract awarded as a result of this solicitation, which could not reasonably have been known prior to award, an immediate and

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998) This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the contracting officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address (es): http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm; www.acquisition.gov/far

52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990) Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the government's best interests, the government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).

Eligibility for Award Proposals shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions in Section L of the solicitation and must clearly demonstrate the Offeror's ability to meet all requirements specified in the solicitation. Failure to furnish full and complete information that demonstrates the Offeror's ability to satisfy the requirements may cause the offer to be considered technically unacceptable. For an offer to be eligible for award, the Offeror must be responsible and must not receive an "unsatisfactory" rating for any evaluation factor. Once a proposal has been rated "unsatisfactory" in any factor or subfactor, the proposal will be eliminated and no longer considered for award. The determination of the Offeror's responsibility will be made by the contracting officer and will be assessed on a pass/fail basis. The government will make determinations responsibility in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors, using information available from other sources. Offers that do not meet the pass/fail qualifications will not be evaluated further and will not be considered for award. EVALUATION ­ GENERAL Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the applicable FAR regulations. Evaluation is performed to determine the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed, potential for completing the work as specified in the solicitation, price/cost completion, reasonableness, and ranking with competing Offerors. Pages submitted in excess of the limitations specified in Section L will not be evaluated by the government. The proposals will be evaluated against the technical and cost criteria set forth in section M. Award may be made without discussion of proposals received. Offerors are requested to initially submit proposals to the government on the most favorable terms from both a technical and cost/price standpoint.
PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 73

The past performance/company experience of the Offeror will be considered in evaluation and selection. Omissions and/or inaccurate or inadequate response could have a negative effect on the overall evaluation. An in-depth review is made to determine the relative merits of the Offeror's proposal and of the company itself. Past performance and company experience will be evaluated from both a technical and business viewpoint. By past performance, the government means an Offeror's record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's businesslike concern for the interest of the customer. In investigating an Offeror's past performance, the government will consider information in the Offeror's proposal and information obtained from other sources, including past and present customers and their employees; other government agencies, including state and local agencies; consumer protection organization and better business bureaus; former subcontractors; and other who may have pertinent information. Past and present customers may then be contacted by the source evaluation board and asked a standard set of predetermined questions regarding the Offeror's performance. Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance. The government is seeking to determine whether the Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable costs. The government reserves the right to look into all or a portion of the Offeror's references, and collect data through the past performance questionnaire or telephone (call) listed references, or from other sources. The government also reserves the right to consider an Offeror's past performance as a sub-contractor. Company experience is considered to be the accomplishment of work which is comparable in nature, size and complexity to the immediate requirement. All information submitted shall be directly relatable experience of the "Proposing Entity" which has been designated as that organization element responsible for executing the proposal and for performing under the proposed award. The person signing the proposal must have the authority to commit the Offeror to all the provisions of the proposal. Evaluation will be directed at the organizational unit designated as the proposing entity. In those instances where the proposing entity does not have directly relatable experience, such as a newly formed Joint Venture or the establishment of a new organization unit within an existing company, the Offeror may provide data indicating the experiences of the organization elements being grouped together to comprise the new organization unit. This information shall be clearly and carefully described as "General Company Information" of the proposing entity. Evaluation and Award It is the government's intention to award a single contract to the responsible, responsive Offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the Best Value to the government, cost and other factors considered. The technical criteria set forth in this Section (inclusive of experience and past performance) are considered to be greater than cost or price. The evaluated cost will be based on proposal analysis as stated for cost in FAR 15.404-1 as described in Section M.

PROCUREMENT SENSITIVE ­ SEE FAR 3.104 Page 74

The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, technical, cost, and other factors considered. The government will make a best value award determination. In making this determination the government is equally concerned with obtaining a superior solution and quality assurance (as set forth in the technical and past performance evaluation factors) to achieve the requirements of the SOW. The government reserves the right to make award to a higher priced Offeror to achieve a superior solution in meeting the requirements of the SOW. The government may award any resulting contract to other than the Offeror with the highest technical rating. Award may be made without discussions based on the initial proposals received. Therefore, Offerors are encouraged to submit their initial proposals with the most favorable terms from a technical and cost standpoint. However, the government reserves the right to conduct discussions. An Offeror's proposal may not be considered if the cost is determined to be unreasonable or unrealistic. The determination of best value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the factors including proposed cost. The Government will make the assessment through the development of trade-off analyses and other analytic studies that involve the assessment of benefits of superior performance capability features and cost. The Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest technical rating. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.

Technical Evaluation Factors: All information provided in the Offeror's proposal shall be evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation factors. All Offerors must provide the requested information identified in Section L. Failure to provide the required documents will result in no further evaluation of the Offeror's proposal, thus, the offer will not be considered for award. This procurement is considered best valued-trade off. Technical factors, when combined are significantly more important than cost and price. The merits of the Technical Factors (Non-cost/price) are listed below: Factors 1 is the most important factor, Factor 2 is the next important factors, and it is weighted less than Factor 1. Factor 3 is the next most important factor, and it is weighted less than Factors 2. Factor 4 is the next most important factor, and it is weighted less than Factor 3. Factor 5 is the next most important factor, and it is weighted less than Factor 4. FACTOR I: OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

Significant Weakness- A flaw in a proposal that appreciable increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. Deficiency- A material failure of an offer to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in an offer that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.

FACTOR IV: PAST PERFORMANCE The government will evaluate quality of the Offeror's relevant and recent past performance on the basis of information contained in the Offeror's proposal, the government's own experience with the Offeror, and the information that the government obtains through reference checks and/or from other sources e.g., contracting offices and the Defense Contract Audit Agency, NFIP Financial Statement Audits, Claims and Underwriting Operation Reviews, or interviews with previous clients or personnel. The past performance evaluation will assess how well the Offeror did on work for government and private sector clients, resilience in the face of trouble, resourcefulness, management determination to see that the organization lived up to commitments or standards, and skill in developing a responsive team. The government will assess the degree to which the Offeror supplies examples of accomplishments to indicate an ability to implement the proposed methods and techniques for solving problems. The Offeror should describe past performance of comparable and related work similar in kind to that required under the contract (i.e., flood insurance experience), including summaries of scopes of work, resource requirements, dollar values, period of performance, and points of contact for each body of work on past or current contracts (or other arrangements) of lesser, comparable, or greater scale. The government will use reference interviews to compare the Offeror's submitted self-assessment of responsiveness to client or regulatory direction, customer satisfaction, completing projects on schedule, within cost limitations, delivering quality products, and cooperation with clients, successor contractors and others, e.g., producers, adjusters, and state governments. The past performance of proposed major subcontractors may also be evaluated.

PRICE AND COST EVALUATION: PRICE EVALUATION Fixed CLINs will be evaluated, but will not be assigned a rating. Total evaluated price of the Offeror's proposal will be calculated and analyzed from the Offeror's Business proposal. A price analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.305(a) (1). Price analysis is described at FAR 15.404-1(b). This analysis is done to ensure that a "fair and reasonable" price is paid by the Government. The Government will evaluate Offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options, as part of our best value analysis. The Price supplied by the Offeror shall be submitted in B.1 Price/Cost Schedule of the SF 33 in the spaces and Attachments provided and shall constitute the total Firm Fixed Price for that services and deliverable. The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the technical proposals increases, or when the price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government. For evaluation purposes the submitted price for CLINs 0002,1002, 2002, 3002, 4002 will be multiplied by four (4) to represent multiple disasters per year. COST EVALUATION Cost CLINs will be evaluated, but will not be assigned a rating. The evaluated cost will be based on the total cost plus fixed fee of all Cost CLINs inclusive of options. The following factors will be used to evaluate cost: A. Completeness. The business proposal will be evaluated to determine if all cost information required by the RFP has been submitted in accordance with Section L, Proposal Preparation Instructions.

B. Cost realism. This will consist of a review of the cost portion of the Offeror's proposal to determine if the overall costs proposed are: 1) Realistic for the work to be performed; 2) Reflect the Offeror's understanding of the requirements; and 3) Are consistent with the unique methods of performance described in the Offeror's technical proposal. C. Cost Analysis. A cost analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404(c). D. Accounting System. The Contracting Officer, will verify evidence provided by the Offeror of an adequate accounting system for accumulating and reporting costs by the CFA or CFAO. The proposal will be rejected if the Offeror does not have an adequate accounting system.
