INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Transaction Services designs, develops, and implements logistics solutions that improve customers' requisition processing and logistics management processes worldwide. In the continuing effort to provide and expand these services to our customers, DLA Transaction Services has been utilizing IBM Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Electronic Commerce (EC) translator for the conversion of Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) standard X12 transactions to MILS documents and the reverse. With this capability, DLA Transaction Services acts as a Gateway for the DoD Services/Agencies and civil organizations and performs translations of electronic documents to/from formats specified by each of these trading partners. DLA Transaction Services also maps and translates ANSI ASC X12 transactions to/from a number of User Defined Formats (UDFs), various versions of XML, as well as MILS and service unique data. DLA (Defense Logistics Agency) primarily uses the COTS IBM Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) EC package to perform the functions required to conduct electronic commerce (EC) between DLA's Inventory Control Points (ICPs), and its commercial and government trading partners. This includes the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC), Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR), and the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC). Each of these activities has had their separate WTX systems, including map processing and trading partner information, migrated to DLA Transaction Services for centralized operation and maintenance. DLA Transaction Services translates DLA application specific User Defined Formats (UDFs) to/from ANSI ACS X12 formats for these sites, and then uses the DoD Global Exchange (GEX) software for routing the X12 transactions to the trading partner community. Therefore, DLA Transaction Services must also maintain the DLA ICP trading partner information. 2.0 SCOPE DLA Transaction Service's requirement is to continue the identification, development, unit/system testing, troubleshooting, and maintenance of the Electronic Commerce Infrastructure (ECI). The Contractor shall provide daily support and maintenance of the formats and business rules required for customer's data transformations. The Contractor shall ensure changes are complete and consistent in all translation environments (currently WTX) during the life-cycle process. The mapping and input/output file layouts used within the ECI must be documented. Each file layout map and accompanying business rules must be built using WTX or the Government's currently used translation toolset. The Contractor shall provide life-cycle support for the conversion of the existing Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) standard X12 logistics ICs to XML formats and verification that all business rules are fully implemented. The Contractor shall develop additional maps for new customers, such as, but not limited to, DLA EBS, DLMSO, DLIS/CCR, NAVICP, DSCR/E2E, NAVICP, AF, NAVY CAV, DFAS, and US MARINE CORPS as requested by DLA Transaction Services. New customer development shall include identification and setup of new trading partner agreements and testing with the customer interface. The Contractor shall provide maintenance of the translation process and trading partner agreements for current production processes such as, but not limited to, the Air Force AFSAC process, DLA ICPs, SEPS financial process, DFAS SMAS/GAFS process, and the CMOS process. The Contractor shall provide WTX (or currently used translation toolset) mapping support for DLA and DoD customer ERP interfaces, as required by DLA Transaction Services. This contract provides for the design, development, testing, and sustainment of Transaction Services' eBusiness translation/mapping services. Transaction Services processes data for many other DLA applications with disparate mapping and transaction management systems, which transforms the data to/from application-based user-defined flat file

formats to/from ANSI ASC X12 formats. This contract provides for a comprehensive analysis of the existing eBusiness processes at the DLA activities. The Contractor shall work with computer specialists at DLA Transaction Services to develop a process for the creation of new WTX (or currently used toolset) maps and for conversion of existing DLA Transaction Services maps to multiple versions of either WTX or currently used translation toolset. The Contractor shall exchange lessons learned information with DLA Transaction Services and attend meetings as required to develop a workable process for map development. The development, unit/system testing, and troubleshooting of any remaining legacy maps being migrated to WTX such as: 1.

APPENDIX A DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES Computer Resource User Agreement Rules of Behavior 1. Introduction The following rules of behavior are to be followed by all users of the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resources. The rules clearly delineate responsibilities of and expectations for all individuals with access to the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resources. Non-compliance with these rules will be enforced through sanctions commensurate with the level of infraction. Actions may range from a verbal or written warning, removal of system access for a specific period of time, reassignment to other duties, termination, or criminal prosecution, depending on the severity of the violation. 2. Responsibilities
As a user of the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resources you have the responsibility to support any security controls implemented. Since nearly all DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computers are networked you have access either through the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resources or over the Internet to almost every unclassified computer in the entire Department of Defense (DOD). This internetworking of computers makes your computer a gateway to vast amounts of sensitive but unclassified information. The security of our networks is only as strong as the weakest link. As a user of a computer in DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES, you play a key role in ensuring the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of our data. Comply with the rules that follow, and you will not be the weakest link.

3. Other Policies and Procedures The below rules are not intended to replace existing policy, rather they are intended to enhance and further define the specific rules each user must follow while accessing the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resources. The rules are consistent with the policy and procedures described in section 4 of the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES Site System Security Authorization Agreement. 4. Rules of Behavior As a user of the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resources: a. I understand that I am responsible for the security of the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES network, login ID and password. b. I understand that I may be held accountable for anything that occurs on the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resources under my login ID and password. c. I understand that passwords will not be shared, written down or displayed on my workstation or PC. d. I understand that access is granted on need-to-know or least privilege basis. Enough access is provided to accomplish my DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES mission and no more. I will not attempt to circumvent established security configurations to gain more access. e. I understand that I will not modify my PC configuration settings to circumvent established security practices, i.e., disabling screen saver password. f. I will not use network resources to create, access, download, copy, transmit or visit Internet sites that involve  sexually explicit or sexually oriented material  material or jokes that demean or ridicule others on the basis of race, creed, religion, color, sex, disability or national origin  extremist or terrorist material, material advocating the violent overthrow of the government or violence against others g. I will not engage in chain letters. h. I will not download copyrighted material without express permission. i. I will not install privately owned software on my government PC. j. I will not use my government computer to engage in gambling. k. I will not use my government computer to solicit for personal gain.

l. I will not use my government computer for any purpose that is illegal or in violation of regulation. m. I will safeguard FOUO information by placing documents in an out-of sight location to prevent unauthorized access. n. I will not attempt to run "sniffer" or hacker-related tools on any DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES computer resource unless I am operating in the official capacity of a Network Administrator. o. I understand that a camera telephone is strictly forbidden and is not permitted in any DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES facility. p. I will use any DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES Memory Sticks in an official capacity only.
q. r. If I observe anything on the system I am using that indicates inadequate security, I will immediately notify the IAM. I know what constitutes a security incident and know that I must immediately report such incidents to the IAM. I understand that use of my government computer constitutes consent to monitoring. My government computer is provided for authorized use only. Government computers are monitored to ensure that use is authorized and that users follow security procedures. Monitoring is also done to see if hackers have gained access to computers. Privacy does not exist on Government computers; I will therefore not expect it. I understand that if I am issued a DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES laptop, it is my responsibility to have the anti-virus software updated by the DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES ADP Helpdesk at least every two (2) weeks.

s.

5. I will comply with security guidance issued by my system administrator and IAM

5 Volume III - Past Performance 5.1 Past Performance Information (PPI) Tool Each offeror shall submit a past performance volume with its proposal, containing past performance information in accordance with the format contained in Section L, Attachment 1, as well as Section L, Table 2.2. that contains instructions for use of the PPI Tool. This information is required on the offeror and all subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners who are proposed to perform 25 percent or more of the proposed effort based on the total proposed price or perform aspects of the effort the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past performance. 5.2 Consent/Authorization Letters Along with the information required in this section, the offeror shall submit a consent letter executed by each subcontractor, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner, authorizing release of adverse past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to such information. For each identified effort for a commercial customer, the offeror shall also submit a client authorization letter, authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror's performance. 5.3 Early Proposal Information Each offeror is requested to submit the information shown in Section L, Attachment 2 for each relevant contract 7 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals. Failure to submit early proposal information will not result in offeror disqualification. 5.4 Recent and Relevant Contracts Submit information in accordance with Attachment 1: Past Performance Information on 3 recent contracts that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed within the past three (3) years of the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance that fails this condition will not be evaluated. If proposing a teaming arrangement, past performance information must be submitted for each team member or subcontractor performing 25% or more of the effort, for a total of not more that four (4) references. Include rationale supporting your Page 8 of 13

assertion of relevance. For a description of the characteristics or aspects the Government will consider in determining recency and relevance, see Section M, provision M002 - Evaluation Factors, paragraph M002d - Past Performance Factor. 5.4.1 Specific Content Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Merely having problems does not automatically equate to an unacceptable rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. This may allow the offeror to be considered more favorably than without evidence of problem resolution. For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an offeror has overcome past problems is required. Categorize the relevant information into the specific Technical subfactors and Price factor used to evaluate the proposal. 5.4.2 Organizational Structure Change History Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), your "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.

6.0 Volume IV - Price 6.1 General Instructions 6.1.1 Price Reasonableness This section is to assist you in submitting data other than certified cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness and balance of your proposed cost/price. Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal. Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, Page 9 of 13

may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal. Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror's proposal. Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and balance. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed prices rests with the offeror. 6.1.2 Price Data Data beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your price position. All data relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation, must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Price volume. Under no circumstances shall this data and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal. 6.1.3 Cost or Pricing Data Requirements In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support a determination of price reasonableness. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient data available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the offeror shall be required to submit additional cost or pricing data. 6.1.4 Pricing Matrix Offerors shall complete the labor rate/hour matrix (Pricing Matrix) listed as Section L Attachment # 4. The Government estimates $5,000.00 per year are to be used for the Travel CLIN. 6.1.5 Travel A Government provided estimate of travel costs shall be used based on budgetary forecasts. The dollare amount for travel costs will be cost-reimbursable and no profit will be allowed. Travel costs are estimated to be $5,000.00 per year. 6.1.6 Rounding All dollar amounts provided shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. All loaded labor rates shall be rounded to the nearest penny. 6.1.7 Estimated Start Date For pricing purposes, the estimated contract start date is 1 July 2014. 6.2 Volume Organization The Price volume shall consist of the following sections:

PCO Instructions for Encryption of eMail to Offerors AFFARS MP5315.3, paragraph 1.4.2.2.3 requires encryption if email is used to transmit source selection information. While most people are familiar with email encryption between government addressees, transmission of encrypted email to a non-government addressee (such as an offeror) requires a few extra steps. Below are instructions for the exchange of encrypted emails with non-government addressees. In order to facilitate the sending and receiving of encrypted emails, offerors must use MS Outlook email configured to support encryption or a different email product that is S/MIME compatible and configured to support encryption. 1. Before you can exchange encrypted email with anyone not on our Global Address List (GAL), you first need to swap certificates one time. To do this, send a digitally signed message to each other. Each recipient then adds the e-mail name to "Contacts" and in doing so, also adds the certificate used for encryption. See instructions below. a. Open a digitally signed message from the recipient. b. Right-click the name in the "From" box, and then click" Add to Contacts" on the shortcut menu. (Shortcut menu: A menu that shows a list of commands relevant to a particular item. To display a shortcut menu, right-click an item or press SHIFT+F10.) c. If you already have a contact entry for this person, select "Update new information" from this contact to the existing one. d. To insure the process is working correctly, the offeror needs to send a test encrypted message first (without including any source selection information). 2. Only the PCO may exchange emails containing source selection information with offerors. Also, in accordance with ASC/CC Memo, "ASC Source Selections," dated 14 May 2012, "Source selection information shall not be sent by email unless approved by the Source Selection Evaluation Board Chairperson, Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO), and Program Counsel." 3. When you are ready to send an encrypted email, insure encryption is selected and include "Source Selection Information ­ See FAR 2.101 and 3.104" in the subject line of the email. 4. For further information: If your source selection evaluation will be conducted in Bldg 570 at WPAFB, please contact the Bldg 570 help desk, through your assigned Acquisition Support Lead (ASL) in the ACE; or if your source selection evaluation will be conducted in a facility other than Bldg 570 at WPAFB, please contact your local IT help desk.

Solicitation Number: FA8604-14-R-7000 Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Support Services

Section M ­ Evaluation Factors for Award
1 GENERAL 1.1 Basis for Contract Award This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15, Contracting by Negotiation, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), DoD Source Selection Procedures, Appendix A, 04 March 2011 and Air Force Mandatory Procedures 5315.3. These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FARSite, http://farsite.hill.af.mil. The Government will select the proposal with the lowest evaluated price from among those meeting the acceptability standards for non-price factors. 1.2 Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR Part 9.1, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable proposal. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. 1.3 Number of Contracts to be Awarded The Government intends to award a single contract to perform all of the functions defined in this solicitation; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted or budgetary limitations. 1.4 Correction Potential of Proposals The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal does not meet the Government's requirements and is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range. 1.5 Discussions The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision. If the offeror's proposal has been evaluated as Acceptable at the time discussions are closed, any changes or exceptions in the Final Proposal Revision are subject to evaluation and may introduce risk that the offeror's proposal be determined Unacceptable and, thus, ineligible for award.

Page 1 of 6

Solicitation Number: FA8604-14-R-7000 Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Support Services 1.6 Solicitation Requirements, Terms & Conditions Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale. The Government reserves the right to determine any such exceptions unacceptable. 2.0 EVALUATION FACTORS 2.1 Evaluation Factors and Subfactors The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal. The Government will evaluate proposals for acceptability, but will not rank the proposals by the nonprice factors or subfactors. Factor 1: Technical Subfactor 1: IT Support Requirements Subfactor 2: Management Approach Factor 2: Past Performance Factor 3: Price 2.2 Technical Factor The Government's technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on pass/fail basis, assigning one of the ratings described below for each subfactor. Any subfactor evaluated as "Unacceptable" will render the entire proposal unacceptable and, therefore, unawardable. Only those proposals determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. However, the offeror is cautioned that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion. TABLE 1 - TECHNICAL RATINGS Rating Acceptable Unacceptable Description Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

The proposal shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors: Subfactor 1: IT Support Requirements Description: This subfactor will evaluate the Offeror's ability to satisfy the requirements specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Section 3.

Page 2 of 6

Solicitation Number: FA8604-14-R-7000 Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Support Services

Measure of Merit: This requirement is met when the offeror's proposal describes a comprehensive understanding and approach to meeting the performance thresholds for a)specific translation tasks; b) GEX administration and operational Support; c) Risk Assessment/Management
(RM) Plan maintenance; d) Tasks and Deliverables completion; e) Planning and Evaluation support; f) Documentation Creation, standardization and maintenance; g) Standard Conversion Table/Function Creation/Maintenance; h) WTX Tree Creation/Maintenance; i) WTX Maps creation; j) WTX Launcher Flows creation; k) map Testing; l) Status Reports preparation and presentation; and m) EB related customers' support.

Subfactor 2: Management Approach Description: This subfactor evaluates the offeror's ability to provide overall management and staffing approach to support services required by the PWS. Measure of Merit: This requirement is met when the offeror's proposal conveys a technically sound approach that meets the following: a) provide contract oversight for management of staffing, contract deliverables, personnel training and fulfillment of Services Summary as defined in Section 4.0 of the PWS; b) provide personnel with the necessary skills to perform the tasks within each functional area; c) provide a clear understanding of the security requirement detailed in Section 7 of the PWS; d) provide appropriate number of personnel possessing the appropriate security clearance to perform the tasks within each functional area on Day 1 of contract performance. 2.3 Past Performance Factor The Past Performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. Offerors must receive a past performance rating of "Acceptable" to be eligible for award. 2.3.1 Ratings. The Past Performance factor will receive one of the ratings described below. TABLE 2- PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RATINGS Rating Acceptable Description Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Unacceptable

Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on

Page 3 of 6

Solicitation Number: FA8604-14-R-7000 Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Support Services

past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." 2.3.2 Evaluation Process. The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the solicitation requirements. In conducting the Past Performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the offeror's Past Performance proposal volume and information obtained from other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to: the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; and interviews/questionnaires with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and Fee Determining Officials, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and commercial sources. 2.3.2.1 Recency Assessment An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated. 2.3.2.2 Relevancy Assessment The Government will conduct an evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine whether the products provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the Technical subfactors. For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the relevance of the work performed will generally be assessed for the Technical subfactors (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered). Consideration will be given to relevant present/past performance effort involved with similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. A relevancy determination of the offeror's past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s). In determining the relevancy of effort performed under individual past performance contracts, the government will only consider the specific effort or portion consistent with that proposed by the prime, subcontractor or teaming partner. The past performance information forms (PIFs) and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance. The Government will use the following relevancy definitions when assessing recent, relevant contracts:

TABLE 3 ­ PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY RATINGS Rating Definition

Page 4 of 6

Solicitation Number: FA8604-14-R-7000 Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Support Services

RELEVANT

Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

NOT RELEVANT

2.3.2.3 Performance Quality Assessment The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts (how well the contractor performed on the contracts). For each recent, relevant past performance citation reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the Technical subfactors (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered). Pursuant to DFARS 215.305(a)(2), the assessment will also consider the extent to which the offeror's evaluated past performance demonstrates compliance with FAR 52.2198, Utilization of Small Business Concerns and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan. The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings. Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports an unsatisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system. For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained improvements. Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated. The Government will use the following quality levels when assessing recent, relevant efforts: TABLE 4 ­ PAST PERFORMANCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT Quality Assessment/Color Description SATISFACTORY (S)/GREEN During the contract period, contractor performance is substantially meeting (or substantially met) all contract requirements. For any problems encountered, contractor took effective corrective action. UNSATISFACTORY(U)/RED During the contract period, contractor performance is not meeting (or did not meet) some contract requirements. For problems encountered, corrective action appeared only marginally effective, not effective, or not fully implemented. Customer involvement was required. NOT AVAILABLE(N)/WHITE Quality and/or performance information is not available.

2.3.3 Assigning Ratings. As a result of the relevancy and performance quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated past performance rating at the factor level (see Table 2). More recent and relevant

Page 5 of 6

Solicitation Number: FA8604-14-R-7000 Websphere Transformation Extender (WTX) Support Services performance will have a greater impact on the Past Performance rating than less recent or relevant effort. 2.4 Price Factor Price proposals will be evaluated for (1) completeness, (2) reasonableness, (3) unbalanced pricing, and (4) Total Evaluated Price. Offerors whose price is determined to be incomplete, unreasonable or unbalanced may not be considered for award. 2.4.1 Completeness. The Government will review the pricing submissions for all information submitted as instructed in Section L, in the prescribed format, and error free and in compliance with Section L of the solicitation. 2.4.2 Reasonableness: The offeror's Price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business. Normally, price reasonableness is established through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. For additional information see FAR 31.201-3. 2.4.3 Unbalanced Pricing: The Government will analyze each proposal to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to prices in accordance with FAR 15.404-1. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 2.4.4 Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The TEP will be evaluated using the attached Pricing Matrix to be filled out be each offeror. The sum of all labor categories and the not-to-exceed travel amount will determine the price for each period. The TEP is the sum of the basic period plus all option periods including the six-month option to extension of services in accordance with FAR 52.217-8. TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only; evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options. 2.4.5 Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options. 3 PRE-AWARD SURVEY The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offeror's capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

B. OTHER SOLICITATION PROVISIONS IN FULL TEXT

L011 APPLICABLE CLAUSES (APR 2013) The appropriate clauses to be included in the contract will be determined based on Offeror's response to the Section K representations. (a) Patent Rights. If the Offeror is a small business firm or nonprofit organization, then FAR 52.227-11, PATENT RIGHTS -- OWNERSHIP BY THE CONTRACTOR, and DFARS 252.227-7039, PATENTS - REPORTING OF SUBJECT INVENTIONS will be used in Section I. Otherwise, DFARS 252.227-7038, PATENT RIGHTS - OWNERSHIP BY THE CONTRACTOR (LARGE BUSINESS), will be included in Section I consistent with FAR Part 27. (b) Cost Accounting Standards. Section I of this solicitation may contain the three Cost Accounting Standards clauses at FAR 52.230-3, 52.230-4, 52.230-5, and/or 52.230-6. The resultant contract will contain only those clauses required based on the Offeror's response to the Section K certification titled Cost Accounting Standards Notices and Certification (National Defense). (c) State of New Mexico. Section I of this solicitation may contain the clause at FAR 52.229-10, STATE OF NEW MEXICO GROSS RECEIPTS AND COMPENSATING TAX. The resultant contract will contain this clause only if performance is in whole or in part within the State of New Mexico and the contract directs or authorizes the contractor to acquire property as a direct cost under the contract. (d) Educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. If a cost-reimbursement type contract is contemplated and the offeror is an educational institution, paragraph (a) of the clause at FAR 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment shall be altered in the resultant contract to refer to FAR Subpart 31.3 for
SECTION L FA8604-14-R-7000 PAGE L - 2 of 3

PART IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS

determining allowable costs. Similarly, if the offeror is a nonprofit organization (other than an educational institution, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization exempted under OMB Circular No. A122), paragraph (a) of the clause at FAR 52.216-7 shall be altered to refer to FAR Subpart 31.7. In addition, if the offeror is an educational institution, DFARS 252.209-7005, MILITARY RECRUITING ON CAMPUS, will be added to Section I of the resultant contract. (e) Subcontracting Plan. DFARS 219.708 was amended to require the use of clause 252.2197004, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program), instead of 252.219-7003, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts), and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in prime contracts with contractors that have comprehensive subcontracting plans approved under the test program described in DFARS 219.702. Also, include in the prime contract, solely for the purpose of flowing the clauses down to subcontractors, FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, and 252.219-7003, or when contract will not be reported in FPDS, FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan with its Alternate III and 252.219-7003 Small Business Subcontracting Plan (DoD Contracts) with its Alternate I. L029 DETERMINATION OF COMPETITIVE RANGE (FEB 1997) (a) Pursuant to FAR 15.306, the Contracting Officer's determination of competitive range of proposals submitted as a result of this solicitation will consider such criteria as technical evaluation/ranking of the proposal, initial cost/ price proposed, and other items set forth in Section M of this solicitation. See the Section M paragraph entitled "Evaluation Criteria," for a definitive listing of these criteria and their relative importance. (b) Offerors are hereby advised that only those proposals determined to have a reasonable chance for award of a contract will be included in the competitive range. While every effort will be made to maintain strong competition, the Contracting Officer will also look to eliminate time consuming and unnecessary discussions with those offerors whose proposals have no reasonable chance for award. This procedure is considered beneficial to both the Air Force and the offerors involved since, in addition to saving further expenditure of resources, acquisition lead time should be reduced. (c) Accordingly, offerors should submit initial proposals on their most favorable terms, from both a technical and cost/price standpoint. Again, it should be noted that proposals will not be included in the competitive range solely on the basis of technical acceptability, nor will they be included due to cost/price considerations alone. (d) Offerors whose proposals are not included in the competitive range will be notified as soon as practicable. Additional information relative to such proposals will be provided through debriefing of unsuccessful offerors. L045 ACCESS TO AIR FORCE COMPUTER SYSTEMS (FEB 2011) If performance under this contract will require access to Air Force computer systems (stand alone or networked), compliance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-119 and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-200 is mandatory. It should be noted that such access requires, at a minimum, a National Agency Check or Entrance National Agency Check in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, Personal Security Program. Offerors should make themselves familiar with local procedures for processing such requirements, and be prepared to be in compliance on the first day of contract performance. Failure to comply with this requirement may be considered a failure to perform.
