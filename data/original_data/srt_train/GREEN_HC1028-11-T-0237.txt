Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of

signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA,
the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.
The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines
that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that
--

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(1) Listed end products.


|Listed End Product                         |Listed Countriesof Origin                                         |

|                                           |                                                                  |
|                                           |                                                                  |

(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then

period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for
these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.


(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—

Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this

2.  Title.  COMPUWARE Contract for Software Licensing and Maintenance Support.

3.  Background.  In 2006, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and COMPUWARE, Inc.  entered into a contract, for the procurement of
COMPUWARE software products (license) and software product maintenance support.  Through the execution of this contract, DISA’s Computing
Services maintains uninterrupted software licensing and maintenance support of COMPUWARE products.  This approach affords improved response
times, controls costs and provides the ability to fulfill the ever-evolving business requirements of DISA, the Department of Defense (DoD), DoD
agencies and the warfighter.

Within the five (5) years since entering into the contract with COMPUWARE, DISA continues to transform its processing environments and
operations, which have streamlined DISA to become a more efficient computing services organization for the DoD. The streamlining approach was
predicated upon several factors including revising processes and deploying best practices to improve the accountability and configuration of IT
assets while streamlining to fit within DoD reduced IT budgets.

DISA’s Center for Computing Services Directorate (CSD) continues to support both mainframe and distributed-based (server/mid-tier) processing
environments while aggressively validating  requirements and reviewing current contracts to determine who provides “the best product at the best
price” with terms aligned to support DISA and DoD workloads.  Mutually favorable contracts with contractors, who work with DISA to understand
and address the unique challenges of the government and the DoD, assists DISA in reaching critical goals and objectives, such as:

    - Establishing standardized DoD licensing models that provide flexibility and scalability
    - Improving the management and control of costs and IT assets
    - Improving the recapture of software investments
    - Improving the usage of IT assets in coordination with the advances in hardware and processing technologies / methodologies
    - Supporting DISA’s Assured Computing Environment (ACE) / Disaster Recovery operations
    - Supporting DISA’s Release Management Change Advisory Board (RMCAB) and Release Management Factory (RMF) centralized distribution processes

4.  Objectives.  The objective of this PWS and the stated requirements in Addendum 1,  Software Licensing, Maintenance, Contract Administration,
and IT Asset Management Requirements, is to provide Compuware software licensing and maintenance to meet current and future Compuware mainframe
software workloads, security, and modernization requirements. while ensuring DISA customers receive uninterrupted, continuous access to their
applications and data.  The scope includes the procurement of additional licenses, increases in software maintenance support, purchases of
additional products and/or capacity changes with IBM products licensed within DISA’s computing services and emergency software support services
as requirements become known.  This initiative is to support DISA Computing Services Directorate’s Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs)
and Processing Elements (PEs), and all software supporting applications transmitted to or processed by these facilities.

The establishment of a new contract for COMPUWARE software will satisfy DISA’s requirements as identified in this PWS and Addendum 1, provide
for the standardization of software licenses for the products identified in Addendum 2, Baseline Inventory for COMPUWARE, and provide the
required software maintenance support as defined in Addendum 1.  The intent of the new contract is to establish another contract with  one (1)
base year and four (4) one year option periods.  In addition, the intent of the new contract is to control costs; provide greater flexibility in
software usage; improve contract administration; and incorporate DISA’s unique terms in support of operations, mission objectives, business
transformation, and the warfighter.

5.  Scope.  The initial scope (Base year of the contract) addresses the baseline software inventory of COMPUWARE products as identified in
Addendum 2.  The scope also  includes the procurement of additional licenses, increases/decreases  in software maintenance support for the
baseline software inventory , purchases of additional products and/or capacity changes with COMPUWARE products licensed within DISA’s computing
services and emergency software support services as requirements become known.

6.  Performance Requirements.

6.1.  Task 1 – Provide Software Maintenance Support

     The contractor shall provide software maintenance support on the software identified within this PWS and Addendums 1-6.

6.2.  Task 2 – Provide the Ability to Purchase Additional Licenses/Units, Capacity and/or Products as Required

     The contractor shall provide DISA the ability to purchase additional licenses/units, additional capacity per software product, and/or
additional software products from COMPUWARE commercially available/generally available portfolio of products.
 3. Task 3 – Provide the Ability to Leverage Software Investments

     The contractor shall propose investment recapture values (monetary value credits) or a calculation method with pricing for determining the
investment value afforded to DISA for licensed software products and/or capacity levels that are not deployed and will not be redeployed,
products lacking or absent of support for which DISA would like to remove from inventory, and for licensed software products purchased by DISA
in good faith, but never deployed.  The current list of “shelved” software products / licensed capacities in DISA’s  inventory that requires the
contractor to propose recapture values against at contract award are identified in Addendum 3, Excess COMPUWARE Software Investment  The
recapture value of the products may be used by DISA at any time during the contract period to off-set contract costs and/or increase inventory
requirements.

Contractor products designated as excess software Investments will be identified by DISA prior to each option year renewal and sent to the
contractor during the inventory reconciliation process.  The investment recapture value(s) will be determined by the calculation method agreed
upon between DISA and the contractor and incorporated into the contract.  At DISA’s discretion, DISA shall have the right to apply the
investment recapture credit at anytime throughout the life of the contract to satisfy current costs of the contract and/or use the credit(s) to
satisfy additional business requirements, including, but not limited to, the purchase of additional products from COMPUWARE commercially
available/generally available portfolio of products.


6.4   Task 4 – Emergency Software Support Services

     The contractor shall provide, on an as needed basis, miscellaneous services that may be required in support of continuing equipment
operations.  These emergency services are not covered under the contractor’s subscription maintenance and upgrade service.  Emergency services
may include, but are not limited to, troubleshooting operating environment problems that cannot be duplicated in the vendor facility; repairing
software problems that cannot be independently remedied through Government personnel interacting with the contractor helpdesk personnel or
through obtaining information on the contractor’s website; installation/implementation of new products that are not currently installed on
Government systems; training services for unique software code requirements; specialized software program coding that the Government has been
unable to do on its own; deinstallation; equipment and operating system reconfigurations, on-site standby maintenance support during scheduled
power outages, and/or surge and emergency conditions services.  .

The vendor shall complete an “ADPE Maintenance Record/DISA Computing Services Directorate FORM 7” for permission to obtain access to the
software/hardware in order to complete maintenance.  All maintenance services completed on-site require a DISA CSD FORM 7.  Addendum 6 contains
a copy of the DISA CSD FORM 7.  The ADPE Maintenance Record/ DISA CSD Form 7 is the official measure of response and repair time.

The DISA CSD FORM 7 shall be completed in cooperation with site help desk personnel, for all software maintenance actions not covered under the
contractor’s subscription maintenance and upgrade service.  Records shall be completed using the attached DISA CSD Form 7 (see Addendum 6), or
electronic equivalent.  The completed report shall be returned to the help desk, or for remote locations to the shift supervisor, prior to the
technician departing the site.  If the contractor fails to submit documentation at the time required, it may result in the Government
withholding payment.  The DISA CSD Form 7 is currently not available electronically.
The “Instructions to Complete the ADPE Maintenance Record” lists the information to be entered into the fields by the OST/help desk personnel.
Vendor CE personnel should review all fields on the DISA CSD Form 7 for accuracy before they sign the DISA CSD Form 7.  Vendor CE personnel will
receive a copy of the signed DISA CSD Form 7 before departing the site or upon conclusion of the service call where the machine is repaired and
operating within OEM specifications.  Specific Instructions for Completing the ADPE Maintenance Record (DISA CSD Form 7) can be found in
Appendix A.

8.  Remedies.  The following remedies apply:

         Items 1, 8-9:

         • If resolution is completed within the performance standard, there will be no adjustment to the invoice amount.
         Items 2:

         • In the event that COMPUWARE ceases providing support for any computer program, then COMPUWARE shall provide at no additional charge
           one of two possible solutions
               o a replacement COMPUWARE computer program (the "Replacement Program") which is Generally Available to COMPUWARE customers and
                 which provides similar, equal or greater substantially equivalent features, functionality and pricing as the Unsupported
                 Computer Program.
               o At DISA’s option, retain the original product, and the Vendor shall continue to maintain the product and provide documentation
                 for the product (provided continuing support and maintenance is provided) at no additional cost.
       Items 3-7:

         • If resolution is not completed within the performance standard, the invoice will be reduced by the percentage of downtime
           attributable to Severity-1 level error.  For example, if downtime is attributable to COMPUWARE software issue and the mainframe is
           down 2 hours, the invoice for the month of performance will be reduced by 2%.
