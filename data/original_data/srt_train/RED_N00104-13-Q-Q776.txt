N00104-13-Q-Q776



Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard have a requirement to purchase 5-bay docking stations with Ethernet, single battery chargers, single docking stations and A/C power packs for Motion F5T and J3600 tablets.



Both shipyards have purchased the Motion F5T and J3600 tablets off a competitive IDIQ contract and now need additional hardware to support them.  The required single battery chargers, single docking stations and A/C power packs are all Motion parts.



The 5-bay docking stations with Ethernet are manufactured by ATS and the docks are designed to work with the Motion F5T and J3600 tablets.  The benefits of these docking stations is that they allow the tablets to be docked directly into the cabinet, they are able to be secured, it charges them and they all have Ethernet capability which will allow the tablets to be updated while they are not in use.  



There are no other known products on the market that will integrate and work with the required tablets seamlessly.
