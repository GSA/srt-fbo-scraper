General Statement of Services

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, and do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of work as set forth in each awarded task order issued in accordance with the provisions in Section G of this TOC and Section C, the Statement of Work. CMS DATABASES TO SUPPORT HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH I. Purpose The purpose of this Scope of Work is to combine the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) and the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) contracts. The CCW was mandated by Section 723 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) to develop a process to disseminate data to health services researchers studying ways to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care provided to chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. The CCW houses identifiable data that is linked, at the individual patient level, for all Medicare claims, eligibility data, nursing home and home health assessments, and CMS beneficiary survey data. This data warehouse is designed to support research, policy analysis, quality improvement activities, and demonstrations that attempt to foster a better understanding of how to improve the quality of life and contain the health care costs of the chronically ill. In 2005, CMS created the RDDC to help CMS disseminate data in a more efficient and timely manner. CMS decided to contract out the processing and dissemination portion of the data request process which involves data recovery fees. Establishing the RDDC has enabled CMS to satisfy research requests in a timely and efficient manner and eliminate the burden on the CMS data center. The CCW and RDDC contracts are currently held by Buccaneer Computer Systems & Service, Inc. (BCSSI) under two separate contracts. The CCW database fulfills research requests using identifiable data while the RDDC database fulfills requests for Limited Data Sets (LDS), which are partially de-identified data, and Public Use Files (PUF). This new contract will combine the two contracts into one. The contractor will use the infrastructure that has been developed by BCSSI (and paid for by CMS) to combine the current CCW and RDDC computer hardware, database design, and data extraction tools into one database. II. Background and Need A. Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) Section 723 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) instructed CMS to develop a separate research data warehouse to support the study of chronic illness. The CCW is the database that was developed to comply with this legislative

RFP-CMS-2010-8A-0001

Page 5 of 100

mandate. At the time of development, CMS leadership decided that the CCW was to be constructed outside of the CMS data center. This decision was made due to the numerous MMA requirements that were impacting the CMS data center. Initially, the CCW was only populated with a 5% national Medicare sample for the years 1999-2004. CMS modified the CCW to contain 100% of Medicare claims and eligibility data from 2005 to the present and 100% of prescription drug data (since the inception of Part D). CCW also contains patient assessment and health status information for nursing home, home health and inpatient rehabilitation care. All of the data are linked at the individual level to facilitate tracking of total Medicare utilization and spending for a unique individual over time. In addition, the CCW has flagged` the Medicare population for 21 pre-determined chronic conditions. Consequently, it is possible to identify cohorts of Medicare beneficiaries by the CCW pre-determined chronic conditions or by a researcher`s definition of diagnostic and procedures codes. These data are housed in a relational database that can easily customize each individual request to meet minimum data necessary requirements. In addition the data base can easily encrypt sensitive data elements, like the social security or the Medicare number. This encryption features is key to protecting the confidentiality of the data but it also permits a researcher to track an individual over time and to associate multiple provider claims to a unique individual. B. Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) The RDDC began in 2005 to help CMS and the data recipient obtain data in a more efficient and timely manner. Prior to RDDC, several offices within CMS frequently responded to researcher requests for CMS enrollment and claims data files. The requests varied in complexity and increased over the years. Fulfilling the requests involved coordination with the requestor and CMS Privacy staff, copying existing data files to cartridge or compact discs, creating custom extracts using CMS` in-house data extract support facility, using commercial off-the-shelf software tools to extract data from data marts and answering questions from researchers about the data received. Given the labor-intensive nature of the data request process, the increasing complexity of CMS data, the rapid growth in the number of data requests, and CMS` limited human and computer resources, CMS decided to contract out the processing and dissemination portion of the data request process which involve data recovery fees. Establishing the RDDC has enabled CMS to satisfy research requests in a timely and efficient manner and eliminate the burden on the CMS data center. CMS still performs the review and approval process associated with data requests but the RDDC has the necessary data files to actually process and ship the data to approved requestors. C. General Activities Since the CCW and RDDC contracts are similar (they both distribute CMS data to researchers), CMS will consolidate the two contracts. This will make the contract more manageable and overlapping tasks (such as the reporting requirements, FISMA and data security) can now be rolled up into one contract, allowing for better coordination of tasks. The Office of Research, Development, and Information (ORDI) intends to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost Reimbursable contract to assist the Centers for Medicare

and Medicaid (CMS) in distributing data to the research community and the general public. This IDIQ will encompass a variety of data activities including database development, database management, data dissemination and data support. The broad activities to be included in this IDIQ contract are listed below: Infrastructure o CMS will provide the hardware and software to be built-in into the contractor`s data center, which shall be FISMA approved and directly connected to CMS` data center. The contractor shall also directly connect CMS staff to this data center and shall meet all the requirements of CMS` privacy and disclosure provisions.

SECURITY CLAUSE -BACKGROUND - INVESTIGATIONS FOR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL

If applicable, Contractor personnel performing services for CMS under this contract, task order or delivery order shall be required to undergo a background investigation. CMS will pay for the background investigations. After contract award, the CMS Project Officer (PO) and the Emergency Management & Response Group (EMRG), with the assistance of the Contractor, shall perform a position-sensitivity analysis based on the duties contractor personnel shall perform on the contract, task order or delivery order. The results of the position-sensitivity analysis will determine first, whether the provisions of this clause are applicable to the contract and second, if applicable, determine each position`s sensitivity level (i.e., high risk, moderate risk or low risk) and dictate the appropriate level of background investigation to be processed. Investigative packages may contain the following forms: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. SF-85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, 09/1995 SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, 09/1995 OF-612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, 12/2002 OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, 01/2001 Credit Report Release Form FD-258, Fingerprint Card, 5/99, and CMS-730A, Request for Physical Access to CMS Facilities (NON-CMS ONLY), 11/2003.

A copy of each of the forms can be found as an attachment in Section J of the contract, task order or delivery order. The Contractor personnel shall be required to undergo a background investigation commensurate with one of these position-sensitivity levels: 1) High Risk (Level 6) Public Trust positions that would have a potential for exceptionally serious impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service. This would include computer security of a major automated information system (AIS). This includes positions in which the incumbent`s actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs, particularly if duties are especially critical to the agency or program mission with a broad scope of responsibility and authority. Major responsibilities that would require this level include: development and administration of CMS computer security programs, including direction and control of risk analysis and/or threat assessment; significant involvement in mission-critical systems; preparation or approval of data for input into a system which does not necessarily involve personal access to the system but with relatively high risk of causing grave damage or realizing significant personal gain; other responsibilities that involve relatively high risk of causing damage or realizing personal gain; policy implementation; higher level management duties/assignments or

RFP-CMS-2010-8A-0001

Page 36 of 100

major program responsibility; or independent spokespersons or non-management position with authority for independent action. Approximate cost of each investigation: $3,500 2) Moderate Risk (Level 5) Public Trust positions that have potential for moderate to serious impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service, including computer security. These positions involve duties of considerable importance to the CMS mission with significant program responsibilities that could cause damage to large portions of AIS. Duties involved are considerably important to the agency or program mission with significant program responsibility, or delivery of service. Responsibilities that would require this level include: the direction, planning, design, operation, or maintenance of a computer system and whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority at the High Risk level to ensure the integrity of the system; systems design, operation, testing, maintenance, and/or monitoring that are carried out under the technical review of a higher authority at the High Risk level; access to and/or processing of information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974; assists in policy development and implementation; mid-level management duties/assignments; any position with responsibility for independent or semi-independent action; or delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust. Approximate cost range of each investigation: $150 - $2,600 3) Low Risk (Level 1) Positions having the potential for limited interaction with the agency or program mission, so the potential for impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service is small. This includes computer security impact on AIS. Approximate cost of each investigation: $100 The Contractor shall submit the investigative package(s) to the EMRG within three (3) days after being advised by the EMRG of the need to submit packages. Investigative packages shall be submitted to the following address: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Office of Operations Management Emergency Management & Response Group Mail Stop SL-13-15 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850 The Contractor shall submit a copy of the transmittal letter to the Contracting Officer (CO). Contractor personnel shall submit a CMS-730A (Request for Badge) to the EMRG (see attachment

RFP-CMS-2010-8A-0001

in Section J). The Contractor and the PO shall obtain all necessary signatures on the CMS-730A prior to any Contractor employee arriving for fingerprinting and badge processing. The Contractor must appoint a Security Investigation Liaison as a point of contact to resolve any issues of inaccurate or incomplete form(s). Where personal information is involved, EMRG may need to contact the contractor employee directly. The Security Investigation Liaison may be required to facilitate such contact. After EMRG fingerprints contractor personnel and issues them a temporary CMS identification badge, the EMRG will send their completed investigative package to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM will conduct the background investigation. Badges will be provided by EMRG while contractor personnel investigative forms are being processed. The Contractor remains fully responsible for ensuring contract, task order or delivery order performance pending completion of background investigations of contractor personnel. EMRG shall provide written notification to the CO with a copy to the PO of all suitability decisions. The PO shall then notify the Contractor in writing of the approval of the Contractor`s employee(s), at that time the Contractor`s employee(s) will receive a permanent identification badge. Contractor personnel who the EMRG determines to be ineligible may be required to cease working on the contract immediately. The Contractor shall report immediately in writing to EMRG with copies to the CO and the PO, any adverse information regarding any of its employees that may impact their ability to perform under this contract, task order or delivery order. Reports should be based on reliable and substantiated information, not on rumor or innuendo. The report shall include the contractor employee`s name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported. Contractor personnel shall be provided an opportunity to explain or refute unfavorable information found in an investigation to EMRG before an adverse adjudication is made. Contractor personnel may request, in writing, a copy of their own investigative results by contacting: Office of Personnel Management Freedom of Information Federal Investigations Processing Center PO Box 618 Boyers, PA 16018-0618. At the Agency`s discretion, if an investigated contractor employee leaves the employment of the contractor, or otherwise is no longer associated with the contract, task order, or delivery order within one (1) year from the date the background investigation was completed, then the Contractor may be required to reimburse CMS for the full cost of the investigation. Depending upon the type of background investigation conducted, the cost could be approximately $100 to $3,500. The amount to be paid by the Contractor shall be due and payable when the CO submits a written letter notifying the Contractor as to the cost of the investigation. The Contractor shall pay the amount due within thirty (30) days of the date of the CO`s letter by check made payable to the United States Treasury. The Contractor shall provide a copy of the CO`s letter as an attachment to the check and submit both to the Office of Financial Management at the following address:

This includes all areas outside the building, such as off-site facility, entranceways, sidewalks and parking areas. Smoking will not be permitted anywhere in Regional Offices or Washington, D.C. Office locations unless permitted by GSA guidelines or local landlord requirements. Contractor employees are subject to the same restrictions as government personnel. Fines up to $50 per occurrence will be issued and enforced by the Federal Protective Service. DRESS The preferred dress codes at CMS facilities are professional attire, business attire or business casual attire.

H-13 CMS INFORMATION SECURITY This clause applies to all organizations which possess or use Federal information, or which operate, use or have access to Federal information systems (whether automated or manual), on behalf of CMS. The central tenet of the CMS Information Security (IS) Program is that all CMS information and information systems shall be protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, modification, diversion, destruction, loss, misuse, or theft--whether accidental or intentional. The security safeguards to provide this protection shall be risk-based and business-driven with implementation achieved through a multi-layered security structure. All information access shall be limited based on a least-privilege approach and a need-to-know basis, i.e., authorized user access is only to information necessary in the performance of required tasks. Most of CMS' information relates to the health care provided to the nation`s Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and as such, has access restrictions as required under legislative and regulatory mandates. The CMS IS Program has a two-fold purpose: (1) To enable CMS` business processes to function in an environment with commensurate security protections, and (2) To meet the security requirements of federal laws, regulations, and directives. The principal legislation for the CMS IS Program is Public Law (P.L.) 107-347, Title III, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf. FISMA places responsibility and accountability for IS at all levels within federal agencies as well as those entities acting on their behalf. FISMA directs Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to establish the standards and guidelines for federal agencies in implementing FISMA and managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information

systems. As a contractor acting on behalf of CMS, this legislation requires that the Contractor shall: Establish senior management level responsibility for IS, Define key IS roles and responsibilities within their organization, Comply with a minimum set of controls established for protecting all Federal information, and Act in accordance with CMS reporting rules and procedures for IS. Additionally, the following laws, regulations and directives and any revisions or replacements of same have IS implications and are applicable to all CMS contractors.

Therefore, the Contractor shall monitor and adhere to all IT policies, standards, procedures, directives, templates, and guidelines that govern the CMS IS Program, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/informationsecurity and the CMS System Lifecycle Framework, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework. The Contractor shall comply with the CMS IS Program requirements by performing, but not limited to, the following: Implement their own IS program that adheres to CMS IS policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines, as well as industry best practices; Participate and fully cooperate with CMS IS audits, reviews, evaluations, tests, and assessments of contractor systems, processes, and facilities; Provide upon request results from any other audits, reviews, evaluations, tests and/or assessments that involve CMS information or information systems;

J-3 STATEMENT OF WORK CHRONIC CONDITION DATA WAREHOUSE (CCW) and the RESEARCH DATA DISTRIBUTION CENTER (RDDC)

I. Purpose
The purpose of this Scope of Work is to combine the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) and the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) contracts. The CCW was mandated by Section 723 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) to develop a process to disseminate data to health services researchers studying ways to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care provided to chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. The CCW houses identifiable data that is linked, at the individual patient level, for all Medicare claims, eligibility data, nursing home and home health assessments, and CMS beneficiary survey data. This data warehouse is designed to support research, policy analysis, quality improvement activities, and demonstrations that attempt to foster a better understanding of how to improve the quality of life and contain the health care costs of the chronically ill. In 2005, CMS created the RDDC to help CMS disseminate data in a more efficient and timely manner. CMS decided to contract out the processing and dissemination portion of the data request process which involves data recovery fees. Establishing the RDDC has enabled CMS to satisfy research requests in a timely and efficient manner and eliminate the burden on the CMS data center. The CCW and RDDC contracts are currently held by Buccaneer Computer Systems & Service, Inc. (BCSSI) under two separate contracts. The CCW database fulfills research requests using identifiable data while the RDDC database fulfills requests for Limited Data Sets (LDS), which are partially de-identified data, and Public Use Files (PUF). This new contract will combine the two contracts into one. The contractor will use the infrastructure that has been developed by BCSSI (and paid for by CMS) to combine the current CCW and RDDC computer hardware, database design, and data extraction tools into one database.

II. Background A. Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) Section 723 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) instructed CMS to develop a separate research data warehouse to support the study of chronic illness. The CCW is the database that was developed to comply with this legislative mandate. At the time of development, CMS leadership decided that the CCW was to be constructed outside of the CMS data center. This decision was made due to the numerous MMA requirements that were impacting the CMS data center. Initially, the CCW was only populated with a 5% national Medicare sample for the years 1999-2004. CMS modified the CCW to contain 100% of Medicare claims and eligibility data from 2005 to the present and 100% of prescription drug data (since the inception of Part D). CCW also contains patient assessment and health status information for nursing home, home health and inpatient rehabilitation care. All of the data are linked at the individual level to facilitate tracking of total Medicare utilization and spending for a unique individual over time. In addition, the CCW has flagged` the Medicare population for 21 pre-determined chronic conditions. Consequently, it is possible to identify cohorts of Medicare beneficiaries by the CCW pre-determined chronic conditions or by a researcher`s definition of diagnostic and procedures co des.

These data are housed in a relational database that can easily customize each individual request to meet minimum data necessary requirements. In addition the data base can easily encrypt sensitive data elements, like the social security or the Medicare number. This encryption features is key to protecting the confidentiality of the data but it also permits a researcher to track an individual over time and to associate multiple provider claims to a unique individual.

B. Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) The RDDC began in 2005 to help CMS and the data recipient obtain data in a more efficient and timely manner. Prior to RDDC, several offices within CMS frequently responded to researcher requests for CMS enrollment and claims data files. The requests varied in complexity and increased over the years. Fulfilling the requests involved coordination with the requestor and CMS Privacy staff, copying existing data files to cartridge or compact discs, creating custom extracts using CMS` in-house data extract support facility, using commercial off-the-shelf software tools to extract data from data marts and answering questions from researchers about the data received. Given the labor-intensive nature of the data request process, the increasing complexity of CMS data, the rapid growth in the number of data requests, and CMS` limited human and computer resources, CMS decided to contract out the processing and dissemination portion of the data request process which involve data recovery fees. Establishing the RDDC has enabled CMS to satisfy research requests in a timely and efficient manner and eliminate the burden on the CMS data center. CMS still performs the review and approval process associated with data requests but the RDDC has the necessary data files to actually process and ship the data to approved requestors.

Information Security

RFP-CMS-2010-8A-0001

Page 64 of 100

The central tenet of the CMS Information Security (IS) Program is that all CMS information and information systems shall be protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, modification, diversion, destruction, loss, misuse, or theft--whether accidental or intentional. The security safeguards to provide this protection shall be risk-based and business-driven with implementation achieved through a multi-layered security structure. All information access shall be limited based on a least-privilege approach and a need-to-know basis, i.e., authorized user access is only to information necessary in the performance of required tasks. Most of CMS' information relates to the health care provided to the nation's Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and as such, has access restrictions as required under legislative and regulatory mandates. The CMS IS Program has a two-fold purpose: (1) To enable CMS' business processes to function in an environment with commensurate security protections, and (2) To meet the security requirements of federal laws, regulations, and directives. The principal legislation for the CMS IS Program is Public Law (P.L.) 107-347, Title III, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf. FISMA places responsibility and accountability for IS at all levels within federal agencies as well as those entities acting on their behalf. FISMA directs Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to establish the standards and guidelines for federal agencies in implementing FISMA and managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information systems. As a contractor acting on behalf of CMS, this legislation requires that the Contractor shall: Establish senior management level responsibility for IS, Define key IS roles and responsibilities within their organization, Comply with a minimum set of controls established for protecting all Federal information, and Act in accordance with CMS reporting rules and procedures for IS.

CMS requires the completion of the Voluntary Accessibility Template (VPAT) for 508 Accessibility and Compliancy as the mechanism for providing information regarding a software product's compliance or non-compliance with the Section 508 accessibility standards. A downloadable copy of this template is available at the CMS website: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InfoTechGenInfo/03_Section508.asp. Task 37: Process Data Requests for Paying Customers

The scope of the RDDC/CCW is to provide data to paying customers. Many federal agencies use Inter/Intra Agency Agreements as the mechanism for paying for data processing so these requests will also be processed by the RDDC/CCW. Any data processing IAA's which do not involve a fee (for example, exchange of goods and services) will be covered under task 38. All payments for data processing shall be provided to CMS. The contractor shall not receive or accept payments for the processing of data. Task 38: Process Data Requests for Non-Paying Customers

There may be instances where CMS may request that the RDDC or CCW process a request for a non-paying customer such as a Congressional entity, CMS contractor or other federal agency under an IAA involving an exchange of goods and services. The RDDC/CCW shall only process requests from non-paying customers when directed by the CMS Project Officer. Requests from non-paying customers shall be funded from CMS' administrative budget.

Approved Accounting and Estimating Systems ­ Offerors shall certify that they have approved accounting and estimating systems that are in compliance with applicable contract cost principles and procedures of FAR Part 31 as well as FAR Appendix A, Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) in order to be considered for award of cost type contracts/task orders. Offerors shall state if their practices used in estimating cost are consistent with their cost accounting practices used to accumulate, segregate, and report costs. B. Additional Cost and Pricing Data Considerations 1. Labor Rates ­ Offerors shall provide labor rates for the labor categories that are expected to be used in the performance of proposed task orders under the First Task Order. Such labor rates shall be projected out for five (5) years. If the labor rates are escalated, the rationale for the proposed escalation rate should be

RFP-CMS-2010-8A-0001

Page 94 of 100

included in the submission. The proposed labor rates should be supported with payroll information, letters of intent or salary survey information. The appropriate fringe benefits, overhead and G&A should be applied to the labor category. The labor categories are being requested so that the Government can evaluated offerors ability to submit supportive cost proposals for cost reasonable analysis. The labor categories and the proposed rates will not appear in the TOC or awarded task orders (except by coincidence). Offerors will be required to propose the appropriate labor categories and rates for each separate task order. Please note that the labor categories may vary from one offer to another; however, the duties and experience should be similar. 2. Indirect Rates ­ a. An offeror with a current Government-approved indirect rate agreement should provide a copy of the forward pricing rate agreement with the proposal. b. An offeror without a current forward pricing rate agreement needs to provide the following: i. The last two years of actual indirect rates with a rate schedule showing both the pool (by cost centers) and base of allocation for each indirect rate. ii. Provide budgeted out year indirect rates with sufficient detail to support the basis of estimate for each cost center in the overhead pool. The indirect bases should be in line with anticipated future work. 3. Independent Research & Development (IR&D) ­ In accordance with the Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulations (HHSAR) 352.216-72, the cost of independent research and development, including its proportionate share of indirect costs are unallowable. Any Independent Research & Development (IR&D) is required to be excluded from indirect rate calculations. 4. Facilities Capital Cost of Money ­ Pursuant to HHSAR 315.404-4, when facilities capital cost of money (cost of capital committed to facilities) is included as an item of cost, a reduction in the profit objective shall be made in an amount equal to the amount of facilities capital cost of money allowed in accordance with the Facilities Capital Cost-of Money Cost Principle. This effectively makes the inclusion of cost of money in a proposal as an element of cost irrelevant. 5. Purchasing System­ Offerors shall state whether they have an approved purchasing system that is in compliance with FAR Part 44. 6. Uncompensated Overtime ­ The offeror is required to include a copy of the

RFP-CMS-2010-8A-0001

SECTION M ­ EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M-1 General Evaluation Process and Source Selection Approach a. The proposal evaluation process under this solicitation will initially consist of an evaluation of offerors` technical proposals for the First Task Order (see Section J-3 for the First Task Order Statement of Work) to assess their relative merits. b. Secondly, the offeror`s business proposal for the First Task Order (see Section J-3 for the First Task Order Statement of Work) will be analyzed for a determination of cost reasonableness. c. The Government`s intent under this solicitation is to make a single award, IDIQ task order contract awards that represent the best value to the Government. d. The Tradeoff Process (see FAR Subpart 15.101-1) shall be utilized so that the Government may consider award to other than the lowest cost offeror(s) or to other than the highest technically rated offeror(s). e. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined are considered to be significantly more important than cost. f. The Government considers that efficient competition can be maintained if the number of proposals in the competitive range for the TOC does not exceed six (6). Therefore, pursuant to FAR Clause 52.215-1 (JAN 2004), Alternate I (OCT 1997), and FAR Subpart 15.306(c)(2); the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. M-2 Evaluation Methodology

The proposal evaluation and source selection process under this solicitation will consist of the following: a. Evaluation of offerors` technical proposal (Volume I), to assess their relative technical merits, shall be based on the evaluation factors stated in Section M-3. b. Evaluation of the offeror`s business proposal (Volume II) shall be in accordance with Section M-4. c. In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.304(c)(1) and FAR Subpart 15.404-1 cost to the Government shall be addressed in every award selection to determine overall cost reasonableness and of individual cost factors. d. It is the intent of the Government to negotiate with those offerors in the competitive range. Upon completion of negotiations, offerors shall be permitted to submit final proposals.
