Medicare Payment Advisory Commission REQUEST FOR QUOTATION - INTERNET WEB SITE REDESIGN TO IMPROVE SITE USABILITY AND APPEAL
The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is seeking a creative, qualified, experienced and professional consultant to redesign MedPAC's current Internet website to improve functionality, usability, and appeal. 1.0 Background

MedPAC recognizes its website as a vital communication tool that provides the Congress and the general public with information about MedPAC 24-hours a day, 7 days a week. MedPAC's web site connects citizens, press, and government and serves as a tool for MedPAC to receive feedback from its constituency. MedPAC's current website contains large quantities of analytic material in the form of intramural and extramural reports, congressional testimony, and informational documents. However, it is limited in its functionality, particularly with respect to permitting users to find systematically organized information on topics that make up MedPAC's work, and with respect to allowing end users to search the MedPAC documents stored on the website. We seek to improve this communication tool to increase usability and engage its users to repeat visits to the site. The current website and content management system is written in ColdFusion. The business model back-end is a Microsoft SQL database. 1.1 The Project

The current MedPAC website (http://www.medpac.gov/) contains comprehensive information regarding MedPAC's research areas, publication, and news releases and informational links. Although navigation has been improved since its inception, further enhancements are needed. MedPAC is looking for the following attributes to increase site use (appeal) and provide users quick access (usability) to the information they seek:
ˇ

ˇ

Content Management o Deliver relevant, high-quality content o Enhance workflow capabilities. o Appropriate amount of information o Timely and current information o Consistent themes o Proper links within and outside of web page Ease of Use o Prioritize content o Clear structure o Navigation o Enhanced search capabilities

Scope of Work

The selected consultant will perform the following tasks in conjunction with MedPAC's Information Systems Manager:
ˇ ˇ ˇ

Plan organizational structure of the site Update visual design and layout of the site Enhance site functionality and content management Publishing the site

In performing each of these tasks, the consultant must work closely with MedPAC's information systems manager, and provide training as needed, in order to ensure that the IT manager is an intergral partner in the development process and able to document all code. Task 1. Plan organizational structure of the site
ˇ

ˇ ˇ

1a. Consultant will familiarize him/herself with the layout and organization of MedPAC's current website. This will include understanding the current organization of web pages, how the website links to the underlying content database, and how entries in the database are coded. MedPAC staff will provide the general flow of information contained on the site, desired information improvements and will look to the consultant to make recommendations for improvement. 1b. Consultant will make recommendations on software (Microsoft-based products) associated with creating or upgrading the site. 1c. Consultant will develop an alternate structure of the site through which information will be better organized and easily accessible to end users. The alternate structure should include a logical ordering of pages within the website, the efficient use of top or sidebar menus, and other enhancements to improve site navigation and usability.

Task 2. Updating visual design of the site
ˇ

Consultant will suggest three (3) alternate visual designs of the website. Such designs may incorporate appropriate use of animation, video and sound, using strictly Microsoft approved products, such as Macromedia/Adobe. Such alternate designs should maintain the current MedPAC logo and color scheme to ensure at least some continuity of the "look and feel" of MedPAC's current website.

Task 3. Site functionality and content management
ˇ

3a. Consultant will maintain or improve the following functional aspects of MedPAC's current website: customer feedback opportunities such as mailing list signup, content management workflow, and the ability to provide comments on public meetings. New functionality could include enhancements such as providing users with proper warning
2

MEDPAC-11-R-0001

ˇ

for things such as long downloads, or navigation away from the MedPAC website. The consultant needs to make such suggestions, modifications and implementations; incorporating Microsoft products, capabilities and compatibilities on the back end and open platform on the front end. MedPAC requires the use of Advanced Server Pages (ASP) (when needed) versus jsp, cgi or perl. 3b. Consultant will improve the functionality of the search function allowing users to access material in the database underlying the site. Currently, MedPAC's website's search function allows users to search by document type, year, and topic area. Additional enhancements would include permitting more detailed search criteria, and better organization of the results returned from a website search.

Publishing
ˇ

Consultant will assist with publishing site to external host and verify correct security permission on external host.
