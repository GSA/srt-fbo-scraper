 NOTIFICATION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS



Background

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, established a policy for all Federal agencies to create and use a government-wide secure and reliable form of identification for their Federal employees and contractors. This policy is intended to ensure a more complete, reliable, and trusted identification of individuals and for controlling the access of Federal employees and contractors to Federal physical facilities and information systems.



This notification is issued to applicants for employee and certain contractor positions with the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) to describe the personal identity verification policies of this agency.



Applicant Identification Responsibilities

As an applicant for a position as an employee or contractor with the RRB, you are required to do the following in order to complete your application process:

Appear in person before the appropriate RRB official and present two forms of identity source documents to prove your claimed identity. The identity source documents must be in original form and come from the list of acceptable documents shown below. At least one document shall be a valid State or Federal government issued picture identification (ID).

Complete and bring with you the enclosed Standard Form (SF) 85, OPM Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, or an equivalent form to provide the required background information; so that a background check can be completed, unless one was previously done, remains on file, and can be referenced. (For additional copies of this form go to .)  

Submit to having your picture and fingerprints taken.



Once a background check has been completed, and no derogatory information is developed, you will be required to:

Appear in person to the authorized RRB official to collect your PIV (Personal Identity Verification) Card. At that time, you will again be required to present a state or Federal government picture identity source document to verify that you are the same individual as the one who applied for the employee or contractor position and submitted the identity information required under this policy.

Accept the PIV Card by signing for the card and acknowledging the related responsibilities.



Responsibilities of Holding a PIV Card

When you are issued a PIV Card, you have the following responsibilities regarding its care and protection. You will be asked to sign a statement acknowledging your responsibilities. Some of the important responsibilities are:

										



You are required to protect your PIV Card from loss or theft. However, in the event that your card is lost or stolen, you must report the loss within 24 hours of noting its disappearance.

You agree that you will not attempt to clone, modify, or obtain data from any PIV Card.

You agree that you will not assist others in gaining unauthorized access to Federal facilities or information.



Protection of Applicant Information

The following information provided by you will be used as part of the process of identity proofing, registration/enrollment, conducting a background investigation, and issuance of a PIV Card:

Applicant’s full name;

Date and place of birth;

Identity source documents; and

Other relevant information useful for proving the claimed identity of the applicant.



This information will be stored in secure electronic media or in locked files. Access to the records is limited to those individuals who have a need to know the information in order to perform official functions under the PIV issuance process. 



Notification of Results of Identity Proofing

If, as a result of the identity proofing process, you are deemed ineligible to be appointed to the position for which you applied and to be issued an official RRB identity document, you will be notified in writing of the identity proofing results. You will also be notified at that time of any additional rights you have under the RRB’s identity proofing processes.



Rights If PIV Card Is Not Approved for You

If you are denied a PIV Card, you have the right to appeal that decision Your appeal should start with a request to the Director of Human Resources to review your case. [Note: If the position/contract you seek is in the Office of Inspector General (OIG), you should appeal to the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG.] Your request must be made within five workdays of receiving notification of the denial, and should specify the basis for your belief that the decision to deny you a PIV Card was incorrect. If you are not satisfied with the decision at this stage, you may make a further appeal to the Director of Administration [or the Inspector General in the case of a position/contract in the OIG] within five workdays of receiving the decision at the initial stage of the appeal.



Correcting Incorrect Information

You have the right to present evidence to correct any information that you believe to be incorrect that is obtained about you as a result of the PIV Card identity proofing, registration/enrollment, and issuance. Such evidence should be presented to the Director of Human Resources [or the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG for a position/contract in the OIG] as soon as you become aware of a decision being made about you based on the incorrect information. A PIV Applicant Representative is available to assist you in removing incorrect 



information from your records. The name of your PIV Applicant Representative is Pamela Martin-Tate. She can be reached at telephone number 312-751-4943. 

Privacy Rights 

The information collected during the PIV process may be disclosed in accordance with the Railroad Retirement Board’s published routine uses as stated in System of Records RRB-46 and RRB-48 and as otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a), including disclosure: to the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority upon an authorized request; to agencies, contractors, and others to administer personnel and payroll systems, for debt collection and for employment or security investigations; to law enforcement agencies if the Railroad Retirement Board becomes aware of a possible violation of a law or regulation; to a Congressional office in response to requests made on your behalf; to the Department of Justice, courts, and counsel during litigation; to unions if needed to perform their authorized duties; to other agencies under approved computer matches; and as otherwise authorized by law or regulations.

 

Violations of Privacy

Any person who knowing and willfully discloses information in violation of the Privacy Act is subject to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties.



Please contact the Bureau of Human Resources (312/751-4580) with any questions regarding the information contained in this notice.

Government Product Accessibility Template for Systems Administration

Summary

Column one involves consideration of all the Sections of the Standard that might apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.  

Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable involves consideration of additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.

Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable.

Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard.

Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards 

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.  



Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.

Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to the expected deliverable?)

Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in providing accessibility information. 

Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.

Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as applicable.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(2) o Outside the United States.

VI.   EVALUATION AND AWARD



		A.	Evaluation



The RRB will evaluate proposals in accordance with the following FAR Clause and as specified below:



1.	Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) FAR 52.212-2



The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The government will use the following factors to evaluate offers: 



a.	Business Proposal



1)	The price score shall be calculated by dividing any 

offeror’s total evaluated price (section II) for each offer both basic and alternative by the lowest total evaluated offered price (determined fair and reasonable) and multiplying the result by 100.  



2)	The total evaluated price shall be calculated as follows:



4[CLIN001A-E + CLIN002A-E + CLIN003A-E + CLIN004A-E + CLIN005A-E] + 4[CLIN006A-D + CLIN007A-D + CLIN008A-D + CLIN009A-D + CLIN010A-D] + 4[CLIN012A-E + CLIN013A-E + CLIN014A-E + CLIN015A-E + CLIN016A-E] + CLIN011 = total evaluated price.  



3)		the sums of the products of:  the RRB-site FFPRs for the basic year for each submitted labor category for the task order times the percentage of total project level of effort submitted for that labor category (LCLOE) by the offeror in the pricing table in Section II.B (Attachment 7a. and 7b.), times the estimated hours, set forth in the example below for evaluative purposes only for task orders.



Example:		TEP = 



(From Schedule B I in Attachment 7a and 7b)



[(011AA FFPR * 335)   +  (011AB FFPR* 135)  + (011AC FFPR* 16) + (011AD FFPR*13)  + (011AE FFPR*13) * 0.90 

b.	Technical Proposal Evaluation



Calculation of the “technical score” will be accomplished by adding all points earned through objective evaluation of each proposal.



The RRB shall evaluate the technical proposals as outlined below for the technical evaluation factors and subfactors below in descending order of importance:



Project management capabilities (90 possible points, 45% of the technical points available).  This information should be presented by the offeror in response to Section IV.B.1.



Plans will be evaluated for how well the offeror will manage the providing of hardware maintenance, software support, and miscellaneous project-related services as demonstrated through the following three requested plans:



Project Plan:



The Project Plan will be evaluated for the quality of the detailed narrative outlining the required functionalities and activities, corresponding staff assignments, and work steps involved in performing the entire scope of maintenance and support activities described in Section III.  The quality of the replacement parts warehousing and delivery capabilities, both for Headquarters and field office locations, will be evaluated.  In order to assure that services can be satisfactorily provided in all locations and for all required equipment, using and managing of any subcontractor assistance will be evaluated.   Offerors shall identify any subcontractors that may be involved, whether pre-existing agreements are in place, their capability and reliability, etc.



Staffing Plan:



The Staffing Plan will be evaluated for the quality of the proposed staffing and organizational structure to accomplish the SOW described in Section III.  The organization chart and related job titles and functions as well as supervisory/managerial roles will also be evaluated. 



Quality Control Plan:



The Quality Control Plan shall be evaluated to determine the extent that the plan will ensure effectiveness, efficiency, soundness, and high quality services incident to performing the SOW described in Section III.  Procedures for deficiency detection and implementation of corrective measures will also be evaluated.



Experience & expertise of proposed staff (65 possible points, 32.5% of the technical points available).  This information should be presented by the offeror in response to Section IV.B.2.



Specific numbers of years experience, demonstrated qualifications, and expertise based on the resumes submitted will be evaluated in the following three areas:



Performing hardware maintenance on the type of equipment listed in Attachment 2 in the manner described in Section III, 

Providing software support for Microsoft network operating systems, Cisco operating systems, and remote image push functions (see Section III), and

Performing various special IT project work in hardware/software environments such as the RRB’s, (see Section III and Attachment 1).



Past performance (40 possible points, 20% of the technical points available).  This information should have been presented by the offeror in response to Section IV.B.3.



The RRB will contact at least three clients for which similar tasks have been performed. The following performance characteristics will be evaluated:



Direct applicability of the referenced project,

Customer satisfaction, which includes satisfaction of end users with the offeror’s service, 

Quality of service, 

Reliability and timeliness of performance, which includes the offeror’s reliability as well as the ability to perform in a timely manner.



Improved Field Office SLA (5 possible points, 2.5 % of the technical points available).  This information should have been presented by the offeror in response to Section IV.B.4.



Points will be awarded if the offeror commits to a 24 clock hour rather than the required 48 clock hour system restoration time for field office servers and work stations requiring replacement of hard drives.



		C.	Evaluation Formula



The following formula will be used as a guide by the RRB in determining which offer is most advantageous to the RRB.



Total Proposal Score = (Technical Score) + (Price Score)



For purposes of this evaluation, the relative weighting of technical  factors to price factors shall be 2:1.

  

		2.	Evaluation of Options (July 1990)  FAR 52.217-5



Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).



		3.	General 



To be considered responsive to this requirement, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified.  Offerors whose proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at the RRB’s discretion, to remedy the deficiency by submitting additional clarifying or supplemental information.



Proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation instructions.  Proposals which are so deficient in these areas as to not warrant further consideration will be rejected and the offeror will be so notified.



Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response.  Accordingly, the objective of this technical evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work.







B.	Award



A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 



The Government will evaluate the proposals received and award a contract, subject to the availability of funds, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Best Value to the Government, price and other factors (including Task order Contractor Management plan, Expertise and Qualifications of proposed staff, past performance, and value-added characteristics) considered.
