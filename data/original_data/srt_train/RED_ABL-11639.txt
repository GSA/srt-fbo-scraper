STATEMENT OF WORK OBJECTIVE The objective of this contract is to provide technical support for the maintenance of AFSC's sablefish longline survey database, change primary keys to composite keys, technical support for improving at-sea electronic data collection method, technical support to help set up remote collection systems on-board commercial fishing vessels, and technical programming support to create R or S language statistical software scripts for data analysis and query tools as described in the Statement of Work contained herein.

INTRODUCTION Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) scientists in cooperation with Alaska's longline industry have been conducting an annual summer longline survey to assess the distribution and abundance of the dominant groundfish species inhabiting the upper slope of the continental shelf in the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and the eastern Bering Sea since 1979. AFSC scientists working at the Auke Bay Laboratories maintain a Microsoft SQL Server database containing longline survey data from 1979-present. This database contains relevant haul, catch, length, age, and abundance information for all species caught in the survey. Database administration support and database maintenance has been contracted out to an independent contractor as well as data query design and R statistical code for performing calculations that populate 16 tables with data needed for tracking species length distributions and population trends. Additionally, technical support is needed to upgrade at-sea data collection instruments and ensure data is accurately collected and compatible with database design. Database specifics The system is comprised of the following: ˇ Longline Database (SQL Server 2005), ~26 tables ˇ Annual Survey Database (MS Access 2003) ˇ LS Import Application (C# WinForms with Visual Studio 2008) ˇ Web Application (PHP with Google Maps API)

ˇ

3

The longline database and the web application are physically hosted in the Seattle data center at the AFSC. Once a year, results of the survey are collected in copies of the annual survey database (MS Access) and loaded into the local SQL Server 2005 Express instance of the longline database using LS Import. The survey data is validated and cleansed, and then the database is shipped in the form of a database backup file to update the database of record in Seattle. ˇ The annual import of the survey data to the SQL Server database uses 14 check queries. Each query is designed to check for certain specific anomalous values and return the rows containing them. The data quality issues that cause the data to return as results in these queries must be tracked down, changed in the raw data, and then reimported. Errors during the import process must be troubleshooted. The LS import application loads data into tables which hold data in its rawest form, i.e., each catch and length record. Because the views that use these core tables are complex and time consuming to execute, a strategy was developed to copy view results into tables to make querying the results more practical. The following picture shows the tables that are "materialized" using the newly developed R code. The materialization process drops, recreates, and repopulates the static tables. The final table is used with the web application so that the public can interactively view data for certain species, areas, stations, and years.

To accomplish (3) above, the Contractor must be proficient in programming in R or S statistical software, have a strong working knowledge of abundance-based population estimation and/or a experience working with fishery survey database applications, and be on-site to work with AFSC staff to maintain and run R code for various statistical analyses, and have a strong background in SQL programming language, Microsoft SQL Server, web applications, and Microsoft Access. MINIMUM CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:
1. Availability to meet twice a month for work sessions in Juneau with ABL employees. 2. A minimum of 5 years experience with SQL programming and database administration and the ability to develop subroutines in R code programming. 3.

Experience developing data collection systems for ruggedized, hand-held computers and Windows Mobile.

Potential vendors to provide complete history and experience that supports that the potential vendor meets all the stated requirements above at time of bid submission. Failure to provide information will result in a non-responsive bid. SPECIFIC DUTIES The Contractor is expected to work closely with AFSC to identify work priorities. The Contractor shall provide the following specific services: Database Administration (estimated hours 100) ˇ Import raw survey data into database using LS import program, help investigate data that cannot be imported due to check queries, create new check queries, and run R code to populate tables. ˇ Work with AFSC staff to create most efficient way to run the R script used to "materialize" tables in the database.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

Troubleshoot data discrepancies with assistance of AFSC staff to ensure data quality and database structure integrity Create customized views for specific data needs. Maintain access to database by AFSC users through an ODBC connection. Assist users by answering questions and troubleshooting problems with accessing and quality checking data. Assist with adding new data and new tables and columns as needed.

Change primary keys in database (estimated hours 90) ˇ Change the primary keys in the survey database from auto-generated values to composite keys throughout the database. ˇ Ensure that primary key change is done so that creating views and manipulating, and changing data is simpler for AFSC database users than the current auto-generated keys used currently. Statistical analyses and associated R code programming (estimated hours 30) ˇ Test and refine existing R code which performs calculations on raw catches and lengths and populates tables in the database. ˇ Provide documentation of existing R code (i.e., explain the purpose of each table that is created) and document all new R code procedures in detail. ˇ Develop calculations of the ratio of fish caught in different regions in the Aleutian Islands (AI) for all species and use this ratio to extrapolate to areas in the AI that are no longer sampled. o Update existing R code to use the new AI ratios for each species to populate tables with the new catch, length frequencies, RPN, and RPW data. Technical support for at-sea data collection system (estimated hours 180) ˇ Work with AFSC staff to improve catch tally data collection system o Research most appropriate portable ruggedized, hand-held computer compatible with Microsoft Windows 7 for collecting catch data o Revise existing code for catch data application currently designed for use in Windows Mobile for use in Microsoft Windows 7 ˇ Test and troubleshoot remote at-sea electronic data collection systems by April, 2012 ˇ Install necessary components and prepare survey data collection system for deployment on the May 2012 longline survey Estimated hours for this project are dependent on contractor's familiarity with Microsoft Access, SQL Server programming, R programming, and remote electronic data collection equipment.
