on the basis of the factors described above.
      (d) Options – The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all CLINs above, including options.  The

                                                         Learning Management System (LMS)

C.0. GENERAL:  The objective for this acquisition is to acquire a web based Learning Management System (LMS) to increase training opportunities
and improve the knowledge, skills and abilities for the user communities in the Department of Defense (DoD) property management, and to provide
a single, common infrastructure to manage learning and training initiatives across the organization.  To achieve this goal, LMS software is
needed to deliver electronic (e-) learning, with a secure login that will allow users access to property management courses, allowing multiple
sessions, progress tracking and certification of training skills.  The LMS shall allow managers to manage, track, and quantify all of the
training, continuing education, employee development, certification, and other learning activities for the Defense Property Accountability
System (DPAS) and Capital Asset Management System – Military Equipment (CAMS-ME) e-learning programs.

C.1. SCOPE: The scope of the contract is to obtain a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) LMS software application with licenses for a minimum of
5000 concurrent users, training, post implementation support and associated documentation.  The LMS will be used to support multiple government
e-learning programs.  The LMS will be installed by government personnel on a government owned server located at a government site.  The DPAS
government program support office is located at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) offices in Columbus, Ohio.

C.1.2. BACKGROUND:  The DPAS/CAMS-ME systems are currently utilizing an Angel LMS to provide e-learning for approximately 4500 students.  It is
operated on a single dual-core 2.2 gigahertz processor with 4 gigabytes of memory and requires less than 100 gigabytes of disk space.  Current
backups are taken manually.  DPAS currently has approximately 92 shared content objects (SCOs) spread across 10 lessons within 30 courses.  CAMS-
ME currently has six lessons within one course.  Courses, lessons and SCOs are added as needed to both systems.  Both systems have a separate
look and students are separated by curriculum, courses and lessons.  Student access, based on job requirements, is provided through these
categories.  Student information including progress and competencies is maintained by the LMS.  The current LMS is Section 508 and Sharable
Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 1.3 compliant.  Negotiations are underway to add additional systems.

C.2.0. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:

C.2.1. Public law Section 508 1194.21, DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation

C.3.0. REQUIREMENTS/TASKS:
          The LMS functionality requirements begin on the following page.
