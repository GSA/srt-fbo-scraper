                                                     Project Title: Health Literacy Tool Shed
                                                               Dated April 8, 2014


   I. Background

Health literacy has become a well-established area of study. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has a health literacy working group that
coordinates NLM’s work with similar working groups administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS). The National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) also has an active health literacy interest group among its
membership.

The Health Literacy Tool Shed, a one-stop (Internet-based) location, will create an arena where researchers can obtain many of the quantitative
tools needed to conduct and improve the methodological quality of health literacy research. The Health Literacy Tool Shed represents a service
that provides outreach to health literacy professionals. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to find many of the
available constructs and quantitative tools used to measure health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention
research. Although the project’s beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the project is designed to create a needed
educational resource.

The Health Literacy Tool Shed will organize constructs, measures, and instruments that are currently scattered across an array of health
literacy research. There is no current resource where practitioners and researchers can consult what health literacy measurement measures,
constructs, and instruments are best suited to a planned project. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to
retrieve detailed information on health literacy assessment instruments, this foundational gap inhibits the field’s development as a coherent
body of knowledge and practice. The end of methodological fragmentation in the health literacy field (and the availability of a website to find
the best instruments for specific projects) also will assist NLM’s future health literacy research and help make NLM a leader in health literacy
research and practice.

The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a unique educational resource. While this type of resource often is touted by health literacy researchers
and practitioners, currently the proposed educational resource does not exist nor is a similar resource under construction elsewhere.

  II. Purpose and Objectives

This Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach project creates a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and
enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. While the project’s beneficiaries are health literacy researchers
and practitioners, the current project creates an educational resource that provides outreach to a research community as well as a topic of
interest to the NLM.

The project will create a one-stop website, where researchers can assess many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve health
literacy research. The proposed Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will provide a vital outreach service for the health literacy
research community. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to identify and assess many of the available constructs and
quantitative measures used to assess health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research in one, accessible
location.

Although dozens of health literacy measurement tools have been introduced and the literature has proliferated, a core problem in health literacy
outreach and intervention efforts is the uneven quality of methods used by health literacy assessment teams and a confusing array of constructs,
measures, and instruments. Some examples of the current methodological confusion and fragmentation in health literacy research is found in
Appendix A, which suggests there are at least fifteen (15) separate measures based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy. Appendix A also
notes there are nine (9) different measures based in the Test of Functional Health Literacy (TOFHLA) as well as many other constructs and
measures of aspects of health literacy.

Despite the widespread availability of health literacy measurement tools, criticisms from independent reviewers reflect that health literacy
research methodological flaws may stem from a lack of infrastructure to support health literacy researchers and practitioners. Since there is no
repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information about health literacy assessment constructs,
measures, and instruments, the gap impedes the health literacy field’s development into a more coherent body of knowledge and practice.

The Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will create for the first time: 1) access to health literacy assessment tools; 2) a health
literacy tool selection process for investigators; 3) an overview of researcher adherence to various health literacy instruments; and, 4)
background information about a construct/measure’s validity or empirical validation.

The Health Literacy Tool Shed shall be a virtual indexing system for health literacy methods with specific information on the following:

●     Administration instructions (how long it takes to administer, number of questions, languages, method of administration, etc.)

●     Constructs measured (i.e. numeracy, word pronunciation, problem solving, general health maintenance, etc.)

●     Links to the instruments (or information on how to obtain the instrument when the Contractor has not secured permission to post the
   instrument) and to validation articles

●     Expert commentary on strengths and limitations and on how to select instruments in various research and practice contexts

The Health Literacy Tool Shed shall also identify some gaps in the current array of health literacy instruments and provide a venue for users to
discuss the development of further health literacy research assessment tools. In addition, the Health Literacy Tool Shed shall provide an
excellent complement to NLM’s Consumer Health Informatics Research Resource (chirr.nlm.nih.gov), which provides general information about common
constructs used in consumer health informatics assessment, including health literacy.

 III. Mandatory Criteria

1) The Contractor must possess extensive academic knowledge and expertise in the field of health literacy research and extensive experience in
