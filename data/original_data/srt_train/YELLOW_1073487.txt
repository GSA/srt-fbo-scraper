Statement of Work (SOW)

   Task Order Title:  Acquisition of Data Modeling Tool and Technical Support


   Agency Department Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration





Background

   The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) mission is to enforce the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and other laws that are
   designed to protect consumers' health and safety. All the Information Technology (IT) systems have been created to meet mission critical
   requirements as well as requirements imposed by executive orders.  These systems assist FDA personnel in tracking and managing cases
   throughout the regulatory workflow.


   The FDA Office of Information Management (OIM) focuses on creating and maintaining resource light IT environments for FDA applications that
   support the increasing need for information sharing and collaboration.  Managing information in this new environment plays a critical role in
   enabling the FDA’s efforts to transform Agency operations and respond quickly and accurately to emerging scientific, technological, and
   economic trends affecting its regulatory mission.


   Under the former FDA Office of Chief Information Office (OCIO), each center’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) used various data
   modeling tools for their data modeling and database design needs. OIM has a goal to streamline and standardize data modeling and design, data
   integration, and data management across FDA centers. One data modeling tool will be selected and used through out FDA centers.


Objectives

   The purpose of this contract is to obtain enterprise licenses and technical support service for an enterprise data modeling tool, with options
   to acquire additional licenses should the need arise. This data modeling software will be used to support the logical and physical data
   modeling, data and database designs, and integrating database designs into the process of developing FDA-wide application systems in order to
   meet the growing demand of FDA’s business needs and ensuring public safety.

Scope

   The FDA is seeking vendor to provide data modeling tool which meets FDA data modeling requirements to support FDA missions with lowest price,
   and software support.

                 versa.


5 Recursive relationships


6 Subject areas – The ability to group “Entities” by Subject Areas (data context, business areas, etc.) as a way of subdividing the Entities
                 maintained in FDA’s data-model.




        5 Conversion capabilities between logical and physical models


6 Create following outputs

            • ERD with multiple layout options and navigation, no overlapping diagram
            • Data dictionary
            • Database build scripts
            • Customer reports

               o Printable Customizable reports - The ability to select a subset of modeling information for attractive user-friendly reports
                 (such as a report of entities, attributes and descriptions).
               o Exportable Customizable reports - The ability to select a subset of modeling information for export to other software
                 environments (e.g. HHS EA repository).
            • Problem reports and data mapping solutions for reverse-engineering models into target data architecture
            • XML Schema generation from logical and physical models



   7 Import/Export metadata (entities, attributes, subject areas, relationships, etc.) to/from other software environments (e.g. HHS EA
           repository).


8 XML Schema Import/Export – Ability to load XML Schema files (such as Health Level 7(HL7)/Individual Case Safety Report(ICSR), and view the
           schema in a graphical form suitable for data-modeling purposes. 


9 Support the implementation of naming convention standards


10 Easy to use and user friendly

            • Quick to learn and use

3. The third chart is for the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) line item. In the base plus four option years, FDA will
periodically need to increase licenses quantities as new employees are hired. This section will not be reflected in the overall price of your
quote. It will be established as an IDIQ line item, and the prices will show what the prices will be if, or when this line item is exercised.
There will be a Not to Exceed (NTE) quantity for each year, as stated below.
