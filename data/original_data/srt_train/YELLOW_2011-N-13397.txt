                                                             STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)


Title of Project: Communications Services and Support for Environmental Health Urgent and Emerging Issues

C.1  Background and Need

The Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry (ATSDR), Office of Communication (CDC NCEH/ATSDR OC) conducts communication activities in communities throughout the nation.  The
NCEH/ATSDR OC assists the Center’s scientists, investigators, and other division staff in communicating specific health and other site-related
information to communities affected by hazardous substances.  The OC uses a wide range of strategies and communication tools to reach community
members, leaders, policy makers, and the news media with important messages.

ATSDR/NCEH specifically conducts health studies, assessments and investigations at hazardous waste sites in communities.  These sites include
Superfund and federal facility sites and other hazardous or potentially hazardous locations.  Issues at such sites often arise suddenly in
response to emerging science, news events or new information presented.  As a result, ATSDR/NCEH has an urgent need to have in place response
mechanisms to address public concerns arising from the events at ATSDR and events associated with NCEH issues.

The NCEH/ATSDR OC seeks a contractor to rapidly develop and execute integrated marketing services to meet its environmental health communication
goals.  Specialized communication expertise and experience in environmental health communication and risk communication are required.  The
contractor shall have the capacity to apply innovative and proven outreach techniques to reach diverse populations with environmental health
information.

C.2  Project Objective

    • Materials Review.  The Contractor shall review existing materials and information on                              ATSDR/NCEH issues.
    • Communications Plans. The Contractor shall develop plans (as required) detailing the strategy and tactics recommended for outreach to
      targeted populations.  The plan shall cover strategic marketing, distribution of information, and evaluation based on an assessment of
      audience information-seeking behavior.  All products and methods of distribution should maximize cost free solutions. The plan shall be
      presented in written form.  The NCEH/ATSDR OC will review and approve all plans, protocols, and products before production.


Task Area 2 - Advertising and Public Relations

    • Matte News Release and Distribution.
    • Audio News Releases.
    • Specialized Outreach Products.  As the contractor develops the communication plan, innovative outreach products or strategies should be
      considered and developed to reach diverse populations.  When the contractor identifies mechanisms to be used to select segments of the
      population for the outreach program, the process must be reviewed to identify if the Privacy Act applies.    Adequate administrative,
      operational, and technical security controls must be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of any personally
      identifiable information (PII) that will be accessed by the contractor.   Electronic transfers of PII via Internet or portable media must

      development of an IT system, such as a web application that will be hosted in the CDC domain, then security language must be embedded in
      the task description.  Standard language from the HHS Acquisition Regulations (HHSAR) shall be inserted into the task definition.
    • Specialized Marketing Services. The contractor will provide marketing and communications training and team coaching to NCEH/ATSDR team
      members. The contractor will provide logistical support for up to two off-site meetings each year.



Task Area 3 - Evaluation Research and Monitoring

referrals from different Web sites to NCEH/ATSDR on-line information.



Task Area 4 - Responding to Urgent and Emergent Issues

The contractor shall be capable of responding to urgent and emergent issues that may require a “surge” in effort/resources. For the purpose of
this IDIQ, “surge” is defined as an unusual or atypical event requiring immediate contractor response and may require additional personnel and
resources until the urgent or emergent issue is successfully resolved.  Historically, urgent / emergent issues requiring a surge effort occur
approximately two (2) times per year, but may be more or less than the historical number for any given year.

Only activities within the scope of this statement of work are authorized. Accordingly, the contractor shall resolve any questions pertaining to
“scope” with the contracting officer for a determination.

Should a surge effort be required, the project officer shall determine if there is adequate funding remaining in the year to meet surge
requirements.  If additional resources are necessary, the government will amend the contract to provide additional funding by creating a task
order.

Surge support would include, but is not limited to:

    • Developing communications and outreach plans;
    • Conducting cognitive testing
    • Selecting media and channels for communication;
    • Message and material development;

she shall notify the originator of the technical direction and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required report(s) within two
(2) weeks of the date of receipt of the technical direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction.  If the Contractor fails to
provide the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any technical direction exceeds the scope of the contract, then it
shall be deemed for purposes of this contract that the technical direction was within the scope.  No technical direction, nor its fulfillment,
shall alter or abrogate the rights and obligations fixed in this contract.

H.7  Agency Ombudsman (Nov 2008)

Awardees under the multiple award contract scenario do not have the right to file a formal protest in connection with the issuance or proposed
issuance of task orders under this contract (except protests based upon an alleged increase in scope, period of performance, or maximum value of
the contract).  In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(6), CDC has designated an agency Contract Ombudsman who is responsible for reviewing the
complaints from contractors on the task order process, in lieu of protests.  The Ombudsman’s responsibility is to review complaints and ensure
that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with procedures in the contract.  The Contract Ombudsman is
independent of the contracting office. The process for handling complaints under the Ombudsman are as follows:

   a) The written complaint shall be sent to:


        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
        Attn: Crayton Lankford, Agency Ombudsman
        1600 Clifton Rd, NE
        Bldg 21, Rm 12018 M/S D14
        Atlanta, GA 30329

        Telephone:  404-639-7022
        Facsimile:  404-639-7212
        Email: CLankford@cdc.gov

      Complaints shall be submitted to the Agency Ombudsman within 10 days after notification of a competitive task order award or of a briefing
      whichever is later.

   b) The Ombudsman will contact the complainant by phone, to assure full understanding of the issues raised in the protest. This contact will be
      made within 2 business days of the receipt of the protests by the Ombudsman.  Since there is only one individual serving as the agency
      Task/Delivery Order Ombudsman, there may be protests received when the Ombudsman is in a travel or leave status.  In that instance, the
      Ombudsman will begin action on the complaint immediately upon return to the office.


   c) The Ombudsman will interview the Contract Specialist involved in the disputed Task Order Request for Proposal (RFP) and the award.  The
      Ombudsman will review the files of the RFP and award files, contract provisions, post award conference materials, and relevant Comptroller
      General decisions, if necessary.


   d) Within 3 working days of completion of the review of the interviews, the Ombudsman will contact the contractor filing the complaint to
      explain the findings.


   e) The Ombudsman will also convey the findings to the contractor in writing, with copies to the Director of the Procurement and Grants Office
      (PGO), the Associate Director of Management and Operations, and the contracting personnel involved in the RFP process.


   f) The Ombudsman will retain a file for the complaints received to be reviewed once per year to determine if any patterns or issues emerge
      which should be addressed by the Director of PGO.

   a) The contractor shall prepare and submit a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government
      information or the commencement of work at CDC.


   b)  The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II , is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be
      filled by contractor’s employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor’s
      employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of
      other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor’s work with the CDC), and members of the public.
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states “All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones,
      and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such
      to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the
      judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced
      by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed.”

   c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the
      identification requirements.

      public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meeting where sensitive information maybe discussed.

   f) The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon
      request during the contract period of performance.  The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee’s name, position, date
      of hire and NDA requirement.

I. Non-public Information
 
[Name of contractor] understands that in order to fulfill the responsibilities pursuant to [Contract name and number] between the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and [Name of CDC contractor] dated [date], employees of [contractor] will have access to non-public information,
including confidential and privileged information contained in government-owned information technology systems. For purposes of this agreement,
confidential information means government information that is not or will not be generally available to the public. Privileged information means
information which cannot be disclosed without the prior written consent of the CDC.
 
In order to properly safeguard non-public information, [contractor] agrees to ensure that prior to being granted access to government
information or the commencement of work for the CDC, whichever is applicable, all employees will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) provided
by the CDC prior to beginning work for the CDC. Contractor agrees to submit to the contracting official the original signed copies of NDAs
signed by the contractor’s employees in accordance with the instructions provided by the contracting official. Failure to provide signed NDAs in
accordance with this agreement and instructions provided by the contracting official could delay or prevent the employee from commencing or
continuing work at the CDC until such agreement is signed and returned to the contracting official.
 
Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner
or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee any non-public information that the employee may obtain in
connection with the performance of the employee’s responsibilities to the CDC.
 
II. Procurement-Sensitive Information
 
Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner

       4) The Contractor shall be responsible for performance in accordance with the terms and
             conditions of the contract when a Task Order is placed by a CDC Contracting Officer.

          accordance with the 2008 Defense Authorization Act, Section 843.


    b.  Ordering Procedures


       1) RFTOP - When the Government identifies a specific requirement for work to be performed under this contract, the Contracting Officer

           • Statement of Work that identifies the Government's requirement; and
           • Evaluation and award factors.


          Contractors are not required to respond to each RFTOP.  RFTOPs will be sent by electronic mail (email) to each Contractor and
          responses will be required via email Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.  Therefore, Contractors are required to have electronic mail
          capability.


       2) Task Order Evaluation and Selection Procedures - Awardees that elect to respond to an RFTOP must submit their proposals to the CDC
          Contracting Office within 14 calendar days, unless otherwise specified in the RFTOP, via electronic mail in Microsoft Word and
          Microsoft Excel formats.  Contractors that elect to respond to a RFTOP shall provide a technical proposal and price proposal in
          accordance with the given Statement of Work. Each offer received in response to a RFTOP will be evaluated on both technical and price
          merits.


          For emergency task requests, a response of less than 7 days may be required.


       3) CDC reserves the right to award individual task orders on the basis of initial offers received without discussion, therefore
          Contractors should submit their best terms and conditions for the technical and price proposals.  Contractors are hereby advised that
          technical and price importance will be stated in the RFTOP.
       4) Upon receipt of the Contractors' proposals, the Government will evaluate proposals received and select the Contractor who offers the
          best value for the Task Order.  The Government and the Contractor will negotiate projected levels of effort and price for the
          individual tasks.  Negotiated pricing for individual tasks shall not be exceeded during performance without prior written
          authorization of the Contracting Officer.

       5) Award of Task Orders will be made as a result of "best value” source selection.  Best value means that the Government will perform a
          price/technical trade-off analysis such that business judgment will be exercised in selecting the most advantageous alternative to the
          Government, considering both the prices and technical merit of proposals. Overall price may become the ultimate determining factor for
          award of the contracts as proposals become more equal based on the other factors.  The degree of equality between Contractors'
          proposals will be measured by the quantity, significance, and applicability of features proposed and not by the total scores achieved.



    The information contained in the proposals will be analyzed and evaluated to determine validity, realism and  reasonableness  of  each  price
          proposed.

       6) Task orders will be issued to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer.  Task orders will include written specifications detailing
          and describing the nature of the work to be performed.  Successful Contractor will be authorized to commence work only upon receipt of
          specific Task Orders issued by the Contracting Officer.

      required under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) or this clause.

(f) Unless the consent or approval specifically provides otherwise, neither consent by the Contracting Officer to any subcontract nor approval
of the Contractor’s purchasing system shall constitute a determination –

      (1) Of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions;


      (2) Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or


      (3) To relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for performing this contract.

K.3  FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that –

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals –

(A) Are  are not  presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;

(B) Have  have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local)
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;

(C) Are  are not  presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the
offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.

(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds
$3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
           (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
           determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
           liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
           (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
           full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (2) Examples.
           (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
           review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek
           Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
           (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a
           notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and
           to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of
           the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to
           contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court

             explain the offeror's corrective actions.  Discuss the effectiveness of the corrective action and explain any impact on cost/price
             and schedule.  Page limit: 3 pages.


   2. If references are not available, the Government will consider predecessor companies, key personnel, or subcontractors which will perform
      major or critical aspects of the requirement which have demonstrated relevant experience to the acquisition.  Accordingly, in such cases,
      the offeror shall request references for each Predecessor Company, key personnel or subcontractors for evaluation purposes – same page
      limits apply.


 (c)  Other Administrative Data

   1. Your proposal must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFP.  In addition, it must contain a
      statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 90 days from the date of receipt by the Government;

   2. Your proposal must list any current commitments with the Government relating to the work or services and indicate whether these
      commitments will or will not interfere with the completion of work and services as contemplated under this proposal.  Identify:

           i. contract number

      contract without assistance from any outside source. (If not, indicate the amount required and the anticipated source);

   5. It is HHS policy that contractors provide all equipment and facilities necessary for performance of contracts; however, in some instances,
      an exception may be granted to furnish Government furnished property or to authorize purchase with contract funds.  If additional
      equipment must be acquired, you must include in your proposal a description and the estimated cost of each item, and state whether you
      propose to furnish the item with your own funds. You must identify all Government-owned property in your possession that you propose to
      use in performing the prospective contract.

 (d)  Cost Data Information

    You must submit, as a minimum, a business proposal supported by detailed cost data.  This cost data will be used  to establish the
reasonableness of the proposed price.

    The itemized cost and the rationale for individual cost categories shall be furnished as follows:

  i. Direct Labor:  Explain the basis for labor hour estimate and include any underlying assumptions.  Provide a copy of your labor rate
     agreement or if you have no such agreement, explain the basis for hourly rate estimates. If direct labor rates are based on a current salary
     schedule, provide the salary schedule for all proposed labor categories. Also disclose your firm’s average experienced annual labor
     escalation for the past two years.  NOTE: see Evaluation of Professional Compensation provision located in Section L.2 above.

 ii. Fringe Benefits: Show fringe benefits as a separate cost category.  Identify the proposed rate(s) and describe the method of calculating the
     fringe benefits proposed under this award.  If you do not hold government approved/negotiated fringe benefit rates and are not in the
     process of negotiating fringe benefit rates, provide 2 years of historical fringe benefit rate information (incurred rates) and current year-
     to-date actual incurred rates – supported by appropriate accounting information which identifies the incurred fringe benefit costs for each
     sub-element comprising the fringe benefit rate pool, and also identify the corresponding labor allocation bases;  Provide a copy of the
     fringe benefit rate and policy guidelines;

iii. Materials and Services: Provide a consolidated priced summary of individual material quantities proposed and the basis for pricing (vendor
     quotes, invoice prices, etc.). Include materials and services to be provided or performed by others. For all items proposed, identify the
     item and show the source, quantity, price, and extent of competition;

 iv. Subcontracted Items:  Provide a copy of cost or price analysis performed on proposed subcontractors, as required under FAR 15.404-3.
     Include these analyses as part of your own cost submissions for subcontracts.  (Also, see FAR Subpart 44.2 for information required to
     support a request for subcontract consent and 52.244-2 -- Subcontracts  particularly subparagraph (e)(1) ); provide a copy of your proposed
     subcontractors' cost proposal and point of contact information.

  v. Travel: Provide the cost of travel including destination, duration, # of travelers, # of days,  purpose, per diem, transportation, and the
     basis for the proposed costs.  If  your firm is a non-profit or not-for-profit organization, provide a copy of your corporate travel policy
     with your proposal if travel costs have been proposed;

 vi. Other Direct Costs: Provide a breakdown of all other costs not otherwise included in the categories listed above (e.g. computer services,
     consultant services, photocopying costs) and explain the rationale for these proposed costs and any underlying assumptions such estimates
     are predicated upon.  Identify calculations that result in the specific cost estimates (e.g. if ODC cost "xyz" = $10,000 , identify the
     calculation of the cost "xyz" such as unit price and quantity etc.).  Proposed consulting services must be supported by signed consulting
     agreements or  letters of intent/commitment that clearly denote the agreed to hourly compensation rate;

vii. Indirect Costs: Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect costs, including cost breakdowns.  Provide a copy of your current
     approved indirect cost rate agreement.  If you have entered into indirect rate negotiations with the federal government and they have not
     concluded, furnish a copy of the indirect rate proposal as an attachment to your business proposal.  If you do not hold current government
     approved/negotiated indirect rates and are not in the process of negotiating indirect rates, provide 2 years of historical indirect rate
     information and current year-to-date actual incurred rates.  This is to include both incurred rates and allocation bases at a level of
     detail that shows the incurred indirect costs for each sub-element that comprises each indirect rate pool, and also show the corresponding
     allocation base(s);

viii. Escalation:  Identify any escalation rates used and the source or basis for the proposed escalation rate(s).  If based on historical data,
     identify and explain how such data is relevant and used to derive the proposed escalation rates.

 ix. Facilities Capital Cost of Money: If you elect to claim facilities capital cost of money as an allowable cost, you must submit Form CASB-CMF
     and show the calculation of the proposed amount (see FAR 31.205-10).

M-1.  Basis of Award:  Award will be made to the responsible offeror(s) submitting the proposal determined to be the most advantageous and the
best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Section.  The Government will make this determination by
comparing differences in the value of non-cost factors (i.e. Technical Proposal: Parts 'A' and 'B ' and Past/Present Performance).  When
competing proposals are determined to be substantially equal in other respects, cost/price may become the deciding factor for award.  However,
the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve slightly superior performance with
regard to the non-cost evaluation factors.


M-2.  Evaluation Factors:  The Government will use the four (4) factors identified below to make a "best value" determination using the trade-
off process.  Technical and Past/Present Performance factors are significantly more important than Cost/Price.  Part "A" (Basic Contract) of the
Technical Factor is more important than Part "B" (i.e. Task Order). The Technical Factor is more important than Past/Present Performance.

M-3.  Technical Evaluation Criteria:  The evaluation of the technical proposal for part “A” and part “B” will be based on the follwing criteria.


Technical Approach

This evaluation criterion will be evaluated according to how well the proposal demonstrates the offeror’s understanding of the techenical
assesment outline in the statement of work.  The evaluation will consider how well the offeror’s detailed plan outlined their approach for
providing the required services, including details in the following specific areas:

   a. Sound and clear stated objectives of the contract.
   b. Understanding of needs and purposes of the contract listed under general work parameters.
   c. Awareness, knowledge and understanding of current work being performed.
   d. Sound, practical and feasible approach for conducting all work specified in potential task orders
   e. Identifing potential difficulties in performance, appropriateness and soundness of proposed solutions.
   f. Identifing capability to respond rapidly and effectively to an environmental issue or incident and how they would go about doing it.


Management Plan and Personnel

This evaluation criterion will be evaluated according to how well the offeror proposed a management plan that described the approach for
managing the work and procedures for tracking project progress, risks, problems, project-related costs and time. The evaluation will consider
whether specific information was included such as:

        a.   A discussion of the proposed management plan and organization for the project showing clear lines of authority and responsibility.
        b.   Clearly stated functions of all key personnel. Which addresses how their activities will be supervised and how time will be
           allocated to specific tasks that adequately address the issues surrounding management of the competitive task order process.
        c.   Qualifications, education and related experience of key personnel with specific attention being   given to experience of proposed
           personnel in program evaluation, survey techniques, relevant program analysis, and management and economic analysis.

Past Performance

This evaluation criterion will be evaluated on how well the offeror’s background, experience, and qualifications demonstrates how successful
they were in managing similar or related work that is comparable in technical and financial complexity and how they would respond rapidly if
requested. Consideration will be given to relevance and the recency of the previous or on-going work and how well it relates to the requirements
of the statement of work.  If the relevance of the previous work experience is not clearly obvious, the offeror is expected to explain how
experience from a similar but different effort is relevant to this requirement.

Facilities

This evaluation criterion will be evaluated according to how well the proposal demonstrates practicality and feasibility of the facilities and
equipment necessary for accomplishment of contract requirements, including the availability of equipment and facilities and how equipment will
be used.  Consideration will be given to adequacy of the of present or proposed physical facilities (office space, training space, equipment,
computing environment, etc.) and their geographic location.








































   Technical:  The Government will conduct a separate technical evaluation for part "A" and "B" (i.e. Basic Contract and Task Order
   respectively).  Parts "A" and "B" will each be evaluated using the  subfactors and relative weights identified in the tables below. The
   number adjacent to each subfactor in the tables below indicate the importance ("weight") relative to the other subfactors.


                                                                 Basic Contract:

   2.  Past/Present Performance (applicable to the Basic contract)
   3.  Cost/Price (applicable to the Task Order# 0001)


   A detailed explanation of the evaluation process is included in paragraph M.4 below.






M-4.  Evaluation Process:

1.  Technical Factor Evaluation Process:  Parts ' A' and ' B '.

Step 1. For each subfactor, the Government will identify “Significant Strengths”, “Strengths”, “Weaknesses”, “Significant Weaknesses”,
“Deficiencies” or “No Identified Ratings” - as applicable - using the definitions from Table 1 below.


Step 2.  Based upon the results from step 1 above, the government will then assign an overall “quality” rating and numerical score from Table 2
that best describes the government’s subjective opinion of the offeror’s Technical proposal for each subfactor.

                                                                     Table 1

|Significant Strength         |A quality or characteristic in the proposal that significantly increases the probability of successful contract performance.         |
|Strength                     |A quality or characteristic in the proposal that increases the probability of successful contract performance.                       |
|Weakness                     |A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.                                                 |
|Significant                  |A flaw in the proposal that significantly increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.                                   |

|Deficiency                   |A material failure of the proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that    |
|                             |increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.                                                    |
|No Identified Ratings        |No significant strengths, strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies identified.                                  |













                                                                     Table 2

|Very Good = 4                 |A proposal having no deficiency and which demonstrates over-all competence. One or more significant strengths have been found, and  |
|                              |strengths outbalance any weaknesses identified.                                                                                     |
|Good = 3                      |A proposal having no deficiency and which shows a reasonably sound response. There may be strengths or weaknesses, or both. As a    |
|                              |whole, any weaknesses not off-set by strengths do not significantly detract from the offeror’s response.                            |
|Marginal = 2                  |A proposal having no deficiency but has one or more weaknesses and/or significant weakness the combination of which indicate the    |
|                              |proposed technical approach would very likely compromise successful performance.  Any noted strengths or significant strengths do   |
|                              |not sufficiently offset the weaknesses or significant weaknesses.                                                                   |
|Unacceptable = 0              |A proposal that has one or more deficiencies or significant weaknesses that demonstrate a lack of overall competence, capability or |
|                              |understanding of the requirement or would require a major revision to correct.                                                      |

Step 3. The Government will then derive a weighted score for the Technical Factor by multiplying the raw score assigned for each subfactor by
the relative weight for the subfactor.  The example below is provided:

Offerors should understand that although a numerical score is used, the underlying assignment of the "raw" score is based upon the subjective
opinion of the technical panel members using the evaluation criteria cited in the solicitation.  Additionally, the Government may consider the
weighted scores of the each subfactor when considering best value.  For example, if two offerors have similar total weighted scores, the offeror
who has higher weighted score for subfactor 1 or 2 may be considered a better value than an offeror which received a higher weighted score for
subfactor 3.  Thus the purpose of weighting the subfactors is to maximize the Government's best value determination among numerous possible
weighted scores between competing proposals.


2.  Past/Present Performance Factor:  Applicable for the Basic Contract only; additional references for Task Order 0001 are neither requested
nor required.

The Government will evaluate information obtained from references provided by the offeror as well as any information supplied by the offeror
concerning problems encountered with such references and corrective action taken and information from any other sources the Government may
obtain.

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a
list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers performance information.

The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, timely and effective resolution of
problems (as applicable) and general trends in the offeror's performance.  Isolated incidents of either superior or inferior performance will
not necessarily affect the offeror's performance rating.

Pursuant to FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past
performance is not available, the government will not evaluate the offeror favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Accordingly, the lack
of a relevant performance record will result in an "unknown" performance risk assessment.

Past/Present Performance Evaluation Process:

   Step 1.  For each reference received, the government will evaluate the "relevance" of an offeror's experience to the tasks included in this
   solicitation.  For purposes of this solicitation, "relevance" is defined as:


    • Experience in developing marketing plans for a variety of project.


    • Experience in Environmental Health marketing.


    • Knowledge of community outreach, developing lists of important personnel and organizations affiliated with a specific project.


    • Knowledge of social marketing and methods to use to promote environmental health and prevention.


    • Ability to assist in the launch (or “roll out”) of a major prevention program.


    • Knowledge and experience in risk communication and emergency communication.


    • Ability to work and gain support with private organizations to assist in environmental health programs.


    • Ability to develop and implement outreach programs.


    • Knowledge of mobile applications and online publication formatting.






        The government will assign an appropriate “relevance” rating from Table 3.


        NOTES:


        1.  The elements of the definition for "relevance" are equally important and thus are not listed in any order of importance.


        2. It is not necessary that an offeror possess past/present experience that meets all elements (i.e. paragraphs ' a ' thru ' d ' above)
        of the definition.  However, an offeror whose past/present performance meets more elements of the definition may receive a higher
        adjective rating for "relevance" than an offeror whose experience meets fewer elements of the definition.


   Step 2.  For each reference received, the government will evaluate the "quality" of performance of each offeror’s past/preset performance to
   assign a "quality" rating from Table 4.


   Step 3.  Finally, the government will consider the combination of "relevance" and "quality" and assign a "confidence" rating from Table 5.
   The confidence rating reflects the government's opinion of the offeror's ability to successfully perform the government's requirement
   considering both the "relevance" and "quality" of an offeror's experience for the references received as well as other sources of information
   obtained by the government.  The confidence rating is an "overall" past/performance rating; accordingly, offerors will receive a single
   confidence rating.

3.  Cost/Price: Applicable to the Task Order only.

The Government will perform a comparative assessment (a.k.a. trade-off) of each offerors' proposed cost/price of the Task Order relative to each
offeror's weighted technical score for "A" and "B" and past/present performance risk assessment to determine the best value.   Offerors shall
provide a detail cost  proposal for task order # 0001.

Quality of Product or Service

0 = Unsatisfactory    1 = Poor   2 = Fair   3 = Good   4 = Excellent   5 = Outstanding
|Unsatisfactory       |Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If       |
|                     |performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar  |
|                     |requirements.                                                                                                                                 |
|Poor                 |Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.                                      |
|Fair                 |Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.                                            |
|Good                 |There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.                                        |
|Excellent            |There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate         |
|                     |additional costs to the Government.                                                                                                           |
|Outstanding          |The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is          |
|                     |commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those |
|                     |rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".                              |

Cost Control

0 = Unsatisfactory    1 = Poor   2 = Fair   3 = Good   4 = Excellent   5 = Outstanding
|Unsatisfactory       |Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely.  |
|                     |If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues constitutes a significant impediment in         |
|                     |consideration for future awards.                                                                                                              |
|Poor                 |Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.                           |
|Fair                 |Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.                                |
|Good                 |There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.                                   |
|Excellent            |There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost savings to the Government.      |
|Outstanding          |The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating  |
|                     |will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and performance clearly exceeds the performance levels    |
|                     |described as "Excellent".                                                                                                                     |


Timeliness of Performance

0 = Unsatisfactory    1 = Poor   2 = Fair   3 = Good   4 = Excellent   5 = Outstanding
|Unsatisfactory       |Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance     |
|                     |cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.                                |
|Poor                 |Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.                                                   |
|Fair                 |Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.                                                         |
|Good                 |There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.                                                            |
|Excellent            |There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.                                                            |
|Outstanding          |The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating  |

 Business Relations

0 = Unsatisfactory    1 = Poor   2 = Fair   3 = Good   4 = Excellent   5 = Outstanding
|Unsatisfactory       |Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should|
|                     |constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.                                                                      |

|Fair                 |Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.                                                 |
|Good                 |Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.                                             |
|Excellent            |Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.                                        |
|Outstanding          |The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating  |
