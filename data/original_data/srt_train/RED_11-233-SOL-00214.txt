Technical Evaluation Criteria: The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the Contractor(s) for this acquisition. All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price. The Government intends to make an award(s) to that offeror(s) whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.

Understanding the Requirements and Technical Approach (50%) The Contractor's proposal demonstrates an understanding of the objectives in the statement of work and specific tasks, and planned execution of the project. The proposal provides evidence of specific methods and techniques for completing each discrete task. The proposal addresses the ability of the Contractor to deal with anticipated potential problem areas. Qualifications and Availability of Personnel (20%) Personnel proposed to be assigned and available for work under the project shall be evaluated on their demonstrated, documented and relevant expertise, education, availability and experience. Management Plan (5%) The Contractor demonstrates an understanding of the oversight and labor requirements and discusses the approach to managing the work, including the work of any subcontracts if used. The contractor is evaluated according to practicality and feasibility. Past performance (5%) The Contractor demonstrates successful accomplishment of similar work and provides current references for the Evaluator's follow-up. Cost (20%) Price or cost to the Government shall be evaluated.
