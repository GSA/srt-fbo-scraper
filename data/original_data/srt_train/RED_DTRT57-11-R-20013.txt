STATEMENT OF WORK



TRANSPORTATION MODELING TOOL DEVELOPMENT



INTRODUCTION



The        () is a Federal fee-for-service organization within the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) of the United States Department of Transportation (US DOT).  The ’s mission is to improve the nation’s transportation systems.  In partnership with sponsoring agencies, the  provides technical research and analysis services to the US DOT, other Federal agencies, state agencies, and other organizations in connection with the transportation-related components of their missions.



BACKGROUND



The Volpe Center and its sponsor, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), require expertise on issues related to environmental concerns regarding noise, local and global air quality, and economic impact.  To support FAA, the Volpe Center has developed and continues to improve expertise in the measurement and modeling of airport noise, local and global emissions, and aviation economics.  FAA also has the additional responsibility of continuing to improve and develop new methodologies to assist in the analysis of aviation-related environmental impacts.  To assist in this effort, the Volpe Center is supporting development of a suite of analytical computer models, e.g., the FAA’s Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) and the Integrated Noise Model (INM) – both of which utilize Geographical Information System (GIS) capabilities to varying degrees.  Specifically, the FAA Air Tour Management Plan (ATMP) Program has immediate need for upgrades to the AEDT/INM GIS.



The Volpe Center and its sponsor, FHWA’s Office of Natural and Human Environment (HEPN),  requires expertise on issues related to concerns regarding noise and local air quality in the vicinity of highways and communities near highway transportation.  The Volpe Center has supported the FHWA’s expertise in the analysis of highway-related environmental impacts through the development and use of a suite of analytical computer models, e.g., the FHWA Traffic Noise Model (TNM) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES).  The Volpe Center also provides similar measurement and modeling assistance to transportation agencies in other modes, including rail and maritime.




 DATA OBJECTIVES



Geographical Information System (GIS)



As part of the Volpe Center’s development of the FAA AEDT and FHWA TNM, a common Geographical Information System (GIS) import/export processor shall be developed to assist in both calculating potential impacts using the same population and geographical data, and also in presenting the results of noise and emissions analyses in a common format.  Producing common output will also be facilitated by the development of a common contouring module to generate reports in flexible, user-defined formats to facilitate these types of geographically-based assessments, rather than making users rely on a small number of standard report formats.  The use of common GIS input/output will easily facilitate integrated analyses.



The Volpe Center is taking steps to maintain a customized ArcGIS framework (ESRI’s GIS objects library) of core GIS layers anticipated for use by all model users.  Also of interest is the use of Manifold’s GIS in C#.  User scenarios would minimally include airport-related analysis, highway traffic analyses, as well as analysis within and around National Parks.  Due to the extensive quantity of such information, data and technical support from a contractor will be needed to maintain the GIS database, convert data from different sources (e.g., global positioning system (GPS) and other formats), manipulate geospatial datasets, and write custom tools to automate GIS processes as described in this Statement of Work (SOW), as well as considerable integration support for its use in the transportation models in question, particularly AEDT and TNM.  Among the main tasks to be undertaken is the development of a database of core GIS layers for AEDT and TNM users, including:

 

Boundaries,

Base data (elevation, hydro, etc.), 

Imagery (orthophotos, landsat),

Census data,

Meteorological data, and

Analysis specific (acoustic zones).
