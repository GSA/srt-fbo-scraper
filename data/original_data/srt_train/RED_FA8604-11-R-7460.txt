DLA TRANSACTION SERVICES

Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) And Customer Wait Time (CWT)
1.0 BACKGROUND The DLA Transaction Services designs, develops, implements and operates Automated Information Systems (AIS)s for DoD Logistics. The DLA Transaction Services Systems perform Transaction Routing, Network Interoperability, and Logistics Information services including worldwide data sharing and reporting. DLA Transaction Services performs these agile support missions for the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), all the Military Services and Defense and Civil Agencies. During the past several years, rapid change has been introduced throughout the DoD. As a result, DLA Transaction Services has undergone significant organizational impact as part of the DoD Logistics reinvention and additional reorganizations in DLA; DLA Transaction Services parent Agency. These DoD changes have occurred over the past 6 ­ 8 years and have resulted in an overall increase in the DLA Transaction Services workload. Additionally, new Logistics processes and practices have increased the overall complexity of the mission, as business process reengineering and other consolidation efforts have been taking place within the Services and Agencies. In addition, DoD directions to incorporate commercial practices and privatize some of the organizational functions throughout DoD have impacted the DLA Transaction Services organic end-strengths. This overall downsizing fortunately coincided with the major modernization of DLA Transaction Services Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) and Automated Information Systems (AISs) allowing DLA Transaction Services to be at the cutting edge of Logistics Automation Services for its customer base. During this time of change in DoD, DLA Transaction Services is also being assigned new critical Logistics missions, functions and tasks. DLA Transaction Services is implementing these new processes and procedures transparently to its customers while maintaining previously provided support services, without interruption, at the same high standard of quality and responsiveness. 1.1 PURPOSE The Contractor will be responsible for the Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) that currently maintains logistics pipeline information for all DOD wholesale items. The Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System/Customer Wait Time (LMARS/CWT) System continues to need development, enhancement and support in order to provide current and additional LMARS/CWT committee reporting requirement and Top 100 (total processing time) drilldown capabilities to enable the DoD Logistics Managers to efficiently and effectively manage their processes. The current LMARS/CWT reporting system provides a set of committee-defined standard reports and drilldowns.

1

The DoD and Joint Staff are requesting more reporting and drilldown capabilities in support of strategic logistics planning goals and objectives. A suite of On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Reporting module tools are being utilized to meet these demands and needs to be supported and maintained. The OLAP tool is Web Intelligence and the reporting tool is Crystal Decisions Enterprise and Reports. This SOW will provide for the professional support to continue to integrate, enhance, maintain and support these tools and to provide sustainment of the existing LMARS/LRT/CWT reporting capability and establish the structure for future reporting requirements. All work performed under this contract will be done in accordance with the baselines established in the DLA Transaction Services. Any changes to these baselines may impact performance.

SECURITY

This Project is Unclassified". The provisions listed below apply to the Prime Contractor and any subcontractors the Prime Contractor may employ during the course of this contract. All personnel working under this Delivery Order will occupy an ADP-I position. It is the Contractor's responsibility to ensure a record check has been performed through the local Police Department on all employees hired to support this effort. If a discrepancy is discovered during the security clearance process that would have been discovered through the local records check, the Contractor shall bear the cost for the security clearance investigation process The Contractor shall certify, in writing to the COR that Contractor personnel have obtained the proper clearance or waiver and request that their personnel be allowed to begin work under this SOW. The COR will verify the clearance and/or waiver with the DLA Transaction Services Security Manager and provide written authorization to the Contractor with an effective date the Contractor personnel can officially begin working against this contract. 11.1 Personnel Security ADP-I -- Contractor personnel working against this contract requiring access to DLA Transaction Services systems are considered to be occupying an ADP-I position if their work will not be technically reviewed by a higher authority in the ADP-I category (reference DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, Appendix K) and as such, will require a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) at a minimum before the Contractor employee can work or bill against this contract. If the proposed Contractor employee does not currently have a favorably adjudicated SSBI, the Contractor employee must complete and submit a Standard Form 85P (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions) for a SSBI and provide favorably adjudicated SSBI findings to DLA Transaction Services before the Contractor employee can work or bill against this contract. In addition, the Contractor is required to provide proof to DLA Transaction Services that the favorably adjudicated SSBI is on file with the Government prior to the Contractor employee commencing work or billing against this contract. An SSBI can take up to 120 days to complete, and another 45 days for adjudication. The first part of an SSBI, which is a NAC, is usually completed in 35 days. ADP-II -- Contractor personnel working against this contract requiring access to DLA Transaction Services systems and whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority in the ADP-I category are considered ADP-II and will require a favorable NAC (National Agency Check) before commencing work on this contract. If the proposed Contractor employee does not currently have a NACI on file they must apply for an ADP-II (reference DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, Appendix K) position by completing and submitting a Standard Form 85P (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions) and for a National Agency Check With Inquiries (NACI) and provide favorable NAC (National Agency Check) results to DLA Transaction Services before the Contractor employee can work or bill against this contract. If favorable NAC results are not received within 45 days of contract award, the Government reserves the right to reject the proposed Contractor employee, regardless of reason. In addition, the Contractor is required to provide proof to DLA Transaction Services that the favorably adjudicated NACI is on file with the Government within five (5) working days of receipt of said adjudication. The NAC is usually completed in 35 days, and another 35 days for adjudication.

16

ADP-III - Contracting Personnel working against this contract that do not require access to DLA Transaction Services systems will be considered ADP-III. Contractors occupying ADP-III positions require a National Agency Check (NAC), but may be assigned prior to completion of the investigation. Contractors designated as ADP-III shall submit, within three (3) days after the start of the contract, a completed SF85P, National Agency Check Request and a completed fingerprint card. An electronic version of Standard Form 85P can be obtained from the DLA Transaction Services Personnel Security Servicing Office. The Contractor is responsible for all costs associated with the security processes described above and will not be reimbursed by the Government. The Contractor employees may be required to attend security related training and periodically read security related materiel. DLA Transaction Services retains the right to request removal of Contractor personnel, regardless of prior clearance or adjudication status, whose actions, while assigned to this contract, clearly conflict with the interests of the Government. The reason for removal shall be fully documented in writing by the DLA Transaction Services Director. When and if such removal occurs, the Contractor shall within five (5) working days assign qualified personnel to any vacancy (ies) thus created. 11.2 Computer Access To perform this work the Contractor requires access to Government-owned computers. To obtain this access for Contractor personnel, the Government Project Manager will submit the required paperwork for the necessary system access. All Contractor personnel provided Government-furnished computer access shall observe local AIS security policies and procedures as provided by the DLA Transaction Services Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO). Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password sharing, performing personal work, file access violations or browsing files outside the scope of the contract, will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may require disciplinary action. Disciplinary action may range from an oral admonishment to removal from the contract. The Contracting Officer shall adjudicate each case and their decision shall be final. The Contractor shall notify the COR, within 24 hours, when for reasons of personnel resignations, reassignments, terminations, or completion of portions of the contract, named Contractor personnel no longer require access to Government computers. 11.3 Software The Contractor shall observe all copyright agreements and shall be held liable for any infringement of copyrighted software licensing agreements and shall compensate the appropriate vendor for each instance of copyright violation. In the interest of protecting Government systems from computer viruses, the Contractor shall not use public domain software nor shall Contractor personnel download software from public bulletin boards. The Contractor shall use only commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), Contractor-developed, or Government-furnished software in performance of this statement of work. The Contractor shall use the Microsoft Office suite of software for preparation of all documentation required in the delivery order. Should the introduction of a computer virus or malicious destruction of computer software, stored information, or hardware result from the use of public domain software or from software taken from a public bulletin board, the Contractor shall be required to repair the damage at no expense to the Government and without impact on delivery schedules or daily operation. 11.4 Information Security

APPENDIX A DLA Transaction Services Computer Resource User Agreement Rules of Behavior

1. Introduction The following rules of behavior are to be followed by all users of the DLA Transaction Services computer resources. The rules clearly delineate responsibilities of and expectations for all individuals with access to the DLA Transaction Services computer resources. Non-compliance with these rules will be enforced through sanctions commensurate with the level of infraction. Actions may range from a verbal or written warning, removal of system access for a specific period of time, reassignment to other duties, termination, or criminal prosecution, depending on the severity of the violation. 2. Responsibilities

As a user of the DLA Transaction Services computer resources you have the responsibility to support any security controls implemented. Since nearly all DLA Transaction Services computers are networked you have access either through the DLA Transaction Services computer resources or over the Internet to almost every unclassified computer in the entire Department of Defense (DOD). This internetworking of computers makes your computer a gateway to vast amounts of sensitive but unclassified information. The security of our networks is only as strong as the weakest link. As a user of a computer in DLA Transaction Services, you play a key role in ensuring the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of our data. Comply with the rules that follow, and you will not be the weakest link.
3. Other Policies and Procedures The below rules are not intended to replace existing policy, rather they are intended to enhance and further define the specific rules each user must follow while accessing the DLA Transaction Services computer resources. The rules are consistent with the policy and procedures described in section 4 of the DLA Transaction Services Site System Security Authorization Agreement. 4. Rules of Behavior As a user of the DLA Transaction Services computer resources: a. I understand that I am responsible for the security of the DLA Transaction Services network, login ID and password. b. I understand that I may be held accountable for anything that occurs on the DLA Transaction Services computer resources under my login ID and password. c. I understand that passwords will not be shared, written down or displayed on my workstation or PC. d. I understand that access is granted on need-to-know or least privilege basis. Enough access is provided to accomplish my DLA Transaction Services mission and no more. I will not attempt to circumvent established security configurations to gain more access. e. I understand that I will not modify my PC configuration settings to circumvent established security practices, i.e., disabling screen saver password. f. I will not use network resources to create, access, download, copy, transmit or visit Internet sites that involve  sexually explicit or sexually oriented material

material or jokes that demean or ridicule others on the basis of race, creed, religion, color, sex, disability or national origin  extremist or terrorist material, material advocating the violent overthrow of the government or violence against others I will not engage in chain letters. I will not download copyrighted material without express permission. I will not install privately owned software on my government PC. I will not use my government computer to engage in gambling. I will not use my government computer to solicit for personal gain. I will not use my government computer for any purpose that is illegal or in violation of regulation. I will safeguard FOUO information by placing documents in an out-of sight location to prevent unauthorized access. I will not attempt to run "sniffer" or hacker-related tools on any DLA Transaction Services computer resource unless I am operating in the official capacity of a Network Administrator. I understand that a camera telephone is strictly forbidden and is not permitted in any DLA Transaction Services facility. I will use any DLA Transaction Services Memory Sticks in an official capacity only.

q. If I observe anything on the system I am using that indicates inadequate security, I will immediately notify the IAM. I know what constitutes a security incident and know that I must immediately report such incidents to the IAM. r. I understand that use of my government computer constitutes consent to monitoring. My government computer is provided for authorized use only. Government computers are monitored to ensure that use is authorized and that users follow security procedures. Monitoring is also done to see if hackers have gained access to computers. Privacy does not exist on Government computers; I will therefore not expect it. s. I understand that if I am issued a DLA Transaction Services laptop, it is my responsibility to have the anti-virus software updated by the DLA Transaction Services ADP Helpdesk at least every two (2) weeks. 5. I will comply with security guidance issued by my system administrator and IAM
I acknowledge receipt, understand my responsibilities, and will comply with this DLA Transaction Services Computer Resource User Agreement.

SECTION L Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors L-III - INFORMATION TO OFFERORS (ITO) AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION
Program Structure and Objectives The DLA Transaction Services designs, develops, implements and operates Automated Information Systems (AIS)s for DoD Logistics. The DLA Transaction Services Systems perform Transaction Routing, Network Interoperability, and Logistics Information services including worldwide data sharing and reporting. DLA Transaction Services performs these agile support missions for the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), all the Military Services and Defense and Civil Agencies. During the past several years, rapid change has been introduced throughout the DoD. As a result, DLA Transaction Services has undergone significant organizational impact as part of the DoD Logistics reinvention and additional reorganizations in DLA; DLA Transaction Services parent Agency. These DoD changes have occurred over the past 6 ­ 8 years and have resulted in an overall increase in the DLA Transaction Services workload. Additionally, new Logistics processes and practices have increased the overall complexity of the mission, as business process reengineering and other consolidation efforts have been taking place within the Services and Agencies. In addition, DoD directions to incorporate commercial practices and privatize some of the organizational functions throughout DoD have impacted the DLA Transaction Services organic end-strengths. This overall downsizing fortunately coincided with the major modernization of DLA Transaction Services Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) and Automated Information Systems (AISs) allowing DLA Transaction Services to be at the cutting edge of Logistics Automation Services for its customer base. During this time of change in DoD, DLA Transaction Services is also being assigned new critical Logistics missions, functions and tasks. DLA Transaction Services is implementing these new processes and procedures transparently to its customers while maintaining previously provided support services, without interruption, at the same high standard of quality and responsiveness. The Government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Offeror's proposal should be structured to reflect an overall understanding of the technical requirements and a Program Management (PM) strategy for managing the contracted work force. 2.0 General Instructions

(a) Notice to Offerors: Funds are presently available for this effort. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. In the event the Page 1 of 13

ATTACHMENT 3: SECTION L
Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs. (b) This section of the ITO provides general guidance for preparing proposals as well as specific instructions on the format and content of the proposal. The Offeror's proposal must include all data and information requested by the ITO and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions. Any Offeror who submits an incomplete package may be considered nonresponsive. The offer shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), and Solicitation. Nonconformance with the instructions provided in the ITO may result in an unfavorable proposal evaluation. (c) The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. Offeror shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal. It is the Government's intent to award without discussions. (d) Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed art work, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. (e) The proposal acceptance period is specified in Section A of the solicitation. The Offeror shall make a clear statement in Section A of the proposal documentation volume that the proposal is valid until this date. (f) In accordance with FAR Subpart 4.8 (Government Contract Files), the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals. Unless the Offeror requests otherwise, the Government will destroy extra copies of such unsuccessful proposals. 2.1 General Information

2.1.1 Point of Contact The Contracting Officer (CO) and the Contract Specialist are the sole points of contact for this acquisition. Address any questions or concerns you may have to the CO. Written requests for clarification may be sent to the CO at the address located in Section A of the solicitation. 2.1.2 Debriefings The CO will promptly notify Offerors of any decision to exclude them from the competitive range, whereupon they may request and receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505. Offerors excluded from the competitive range may request an immediate debriefing or they may choose to wait until after the source selection decision to request a debriefing. However, Offerors excluded from the competitive range are entitled to no more than one debriefing for each proposal. The CO will notify unsuccessful Offerors in the competitive range of the source selection decision in accordance with FAR 15.506. Upon such notification, unsuccessful Page 2 of 13

ATTACHMENT 3: SECTION L
Offerors may request and receive a debriefing. Offerors desiring debriefing must make their request in accordance with the requirements of FAR 15.505 or 15.506, as applicable. 2.1.3 Discrepancies If an Offeror believes that the requirements in these instructions or elsewhere in the RFP contain an error, omission, or are otherwise unsound, the Offeror shall immediately notify the CO in writing with supporting rationale, as well as the remedies the Offeror is asking the CO to consider as related to the omission or error. The Offeror is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion. This reservation includes matters of additional or substitute pages of the initial proposal. 2.1.4 Communications Exchanges of source selection information between Government and Offerors will be controlled by the Contracting Officer. Email may be used to transmit such information to Offerors only if the email can be sent and received encrypted and includes "Source Selection Information ­ See FAR 2.101 & 3.104" in the Subject line. Otherwise, source selection information will be transmitted via USPS, FedEx, UPS or pick-up by local company representative. 2.2 Organization/Number of Copies/Page Limits The Offeror shall prepare the proposal as set forth in the Proposal Organization Table (Table 2.2 below).

Section M
1.0 Basis for Contract Award. This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedure, in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process. The offerer's technical and cost proposals will be evaluated to make an award decision. This is a competitive source selection to award a task order under a GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) in which competing Offerors' past performance history, technical competence and ability to deliver appropriately security-cleared personnel has been thoroughly evaluated. Cost proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness. The proposal with the lowest cost that has been determined to be reasonable will be evaluated for technical merit. Technical proposals will be reviewed to determine whether the respondents understand the requirements and are capable of performing the requirements. Award will be made to the Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation), is judged technically acceptable and whose bid represents the lowest cost to the Government. While the Government source selection evaluation team and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. 1.1 It is the Government's intent to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. 1.2 The Government intends to award a single contract to perform all of the functions defined in this solicitation; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted or budgetary limitations. 1.3 The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. 1.4 The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the correction potential of any proposal rated as "Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable", or "Unacceptable" as those ratings are defined in paragraph 3.3 below. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an Offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.

Page 1 of 4

ATTACHMENT 4: SECTION M

1.5 By submission of its offer, the Offeror agrees to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows. 2.0 Price Evaluation. The Government shall rank all offers by Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The TEP is calculated as the base period plus option years for CLIN 0001 as indicated in the pricing matrix, attachment 1 of Section L. The Offeror's price proposal will be evaluated as defined below: 2.1 Evaluation Technique. The Offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated against the criteria of reasonableness. 2.1.1 Reasonableness. The task order proposal prices (for Labor CLINs only) and all labor rates will be evaluated for reasonableness. All other Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) values, (e.g. Travel) will be determined by the Government and provided to the offeror. For a price to be reasonable, it shall adhere to the labor rates established in their FSS contract. It shall also represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established throught adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. For additional information, see FAR 31.201-3. 2.1.2 The Government may also determine a proposal unacceptable should the proposed prices, including labor rates be materially unbalanced. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques. 3.0 Technical Acceptability. The Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable, as defined in Paragraph 3.3 below. Only those technical proposals determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions will be considered for award. However, the Offeror is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion. The proposals shall be evaluated against the following sub-factors: 3.1 Sub-factor 1: Understanding and Capability to Satisfy DLA Transaction Serices Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting and Customer Wait Time (CWT) requirements. This sub-factor will be used to evaluate the Offeror's ability to satisfy the requirements specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Section 3. 3.1.1 Measure of Merit: This sub-factor is met when the Offeror's proposal clearly and adequately addresses each task in the two functional areas:

Page 2 of 4

ATTACHMENT 4: SECTION M

a) Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting (LMARS) (Paragraph 3.1 ­ 3.2) and b) Customer Wait Time (CWT (Paragraph 3.3 ­ 3.11). A proposal will be deemed to adequately address each task when the offeror's proposal indicates that they can meetin the following: a) The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a clear understanding of the functional area. b) The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a clear ability to perform the tasks indicated within a functional area. c) The Offeror's proposal shall demonstrate an ability to satisfy the performance thresholds indicated for each functional area and tasks therein. 3.2 Sub-factor 2: Management Approach. This sub-factor evaluates the Offeror's proposed management approach and staffing to support the requirements of the Performance Work Statement for the base period and all options. 3.2.1 Measure of Merit. This sub-factor is met when the Offeror's proposal has clearly demonstrated each of the following areas: A) A comprehesive and effective approach that will provide for successful overall management and execution of the PWS requirements, and B) A comprehensive and sound approach to providing initial staffing and retaining qualified personnel who meet all tranining, certifications, and clearance necessary to accomplish the PWS requirements. 3.3 Each sub-factor within the technical factor will receive one of the ratings described below. Sub-factor ratings shall not be rolled up into an overall rating for the technical factor. Any unacceptable sub-factor assessment shall render the entire technical factor as unacceptable. The following technical rating definitions will be used in the assessment of technical acceptability. Acceptable Reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance. The proposal does not clearly meet some specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance, but there is reason to believe that through minor revisions, an acceptable proposal could result. For award without discussions these proposals are considered "unacceptable." The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.

Unacceptable

Final Award Methodology.

4.1 After final price evaluation of all offers is complete, the Source Selection Team will make a technical evaluation of the proposal with the lowest TEP. If the proposal with the lowest evaluated price is not deemed to be technically acceptable then the proposal with the next lowest evaluated price will be evaluated for technical acceptability. This process will continue until a proposal is deemed technically acceptable. Award will be made to the vendor providing a technically acceptable offer at the lowest TEP. 4.2 Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Section L. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse information to which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. 5.0 Discussions If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision. 6.0 Solicitation Requirements, Terms, and Conditions Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale.

L011 APPLICABLE CLAUSES (MAY 2009) The appropriate clauses to be included in the contract will be determined based on Offeror's response to the Section K representations. (a) Patent Rights.

Otherwise, DFARS 252.227-7038, PATENT RIGHTS - OWNERSHIP BY THE CONTRACTOR (LARGE BUSINESS), will be included in Section I consistent with FAR Part 27. (b) Cost Accounting Standards. Section I of this solicitation may contain the three Cost Accounting Standards clauses at FAR 52.230-3, 52.230-4, 52.230-5, and/or 52.230-6. The resultant contract will contain only those clauses required based on the Offeror's response to the Section K certification titled Cost Accounting Standards Notices and Certification (National Defense). (c) State of New Mexico. Section I of this solicitation may contain the clause at FAR 52.229-10, STATE OF NEW MEXICO GROSS RECEIPTS AND COMPENSATING TAX. The resultant contract will contain this clause only if performance is in whole or in part within the State of New Mexico and the contract directs or authorizes the contractor to acquire property as a direct cost under the contract. (d) Educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. If a cost-reimbursement type contract is contemplated and the offeror is an educational institution, paragraph (a) of the clause at FAR 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment shall be altered in the resultant contract to refer to FAR Subpart 31.3 for determining allowable costs. Similarly, if the offeror is a nonprofit organization (other than an educational institution, a State or local government, or a nonprofit organization exempted under OMB Circular No. A122), paragraph (a) of the clause at FAR 52.216-7 shall be altered to refer to FAR Subpart 31.7. In addition, if the offeror is an educational institution, DFARS 252.209-7005, MILITARY RECRUITING ON CAMPUS, will be added to Section I of the resultant contract. (e) Subcontracting Plan.

L029 DETERMINATION OF COMPETITIVE RANGE (FEB 1997) (a) Pursuant to FAR 15.306, the Contracting Officer's determination of competitive range of proposals submitted as a result of this solicitation will consider such criteria as technical evaluation/ranking of the proposal, initial cost/ price proposed, and other items set forth in Section M of this solicitation. See the Section M paragraph entitled "Evaluation Criteria," for a definitive listing of these criteria and their relative importance. (b) Offerors are hereby advised that only those proposals determined to have a reasonable chance for award of a contract will be included in the competitive range. While every effort will be made to maintain strong competition, the Contracting Officer will also look to eliminate time consuming and unnecessary discussions with those offerors whose proposals have no reasonable chance for award. This procedure is considered beneficial to both the Air Force and the offerors involved since, in addition to saving further expenditure of resources, acquisition lead time should be reduced.

SECTION L FA8604-11-R-7460 PAGE L - 2 of 3

PART IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS

(c) Accordingly, offerors should submit initial proposals on their most favorable terms, from both a technical and cost/price standpoint. Again, it should be noted that proposals will not be included in the competitive range solely on the basis of technical acceptability, nor will they be included due to cost/price considerations alone. (d) Offerors whose proposals are not included in the competitive range will be notified as soon as practicable. Additional information relative to such proposals will be provided through debriefing of unsuccessful offerors. L045 ACCESS TO AIR FORCE COMPUTER SYSTEMS (FEB 2011) If performance under this contract will require access to Air Force computer systems (stand alone or networked), compliance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-119 and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-200 is mandatory. It should be noted that such access requires, at a minimum, a National Agency Check or Entrance National Agency Check in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, Personal Security Program. Offerors should make themselves familiar with local procedures for processing such requirements, and be prepared to be in compliance on the first day of contract performance.
