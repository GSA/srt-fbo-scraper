52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout--Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours

HC1047-12-T-4011 Page 6 of 11

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order. The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing. In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this contract/order. A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification. A Contractor's failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order. If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance. (End of clause)

CONFLICT OF INTEREST (IAW FAR 9.5) It is understood and agreed that the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of the Statement of Work made a part of this contract, is neither obligated nor expected to deliver or provide material or perform work, which will place the Contractor in an organizational conflict of interest, which could serve as a basis for excluding the Contractor from supplying products or services to the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Further, during the course of this contract, the Contracting Officer will not knowingly unilaterally direct the Contractor to perform work, in contravention of the above understanding. It will be the Contractor's responsibility to identify any situation in which the potential for an organizational conflict of interest exists. However, if the Contracting Officer discerns the potential for an organizational conflict of interest prior to the execution of any task or amendment thereto, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor, and the parties shall mutually take action to resolve any potential organizational conflict of interest. For the purposes of this clause, an organizational conflict of interest is understood to include tasking which involves the preparation of a complete specification of materials leading directly and predictably to competitive procurement of a system. This clause shall be included in any subcontracts awarded under this contract.
