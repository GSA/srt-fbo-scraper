3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: This acquisition is the second of two contract procurements for technical hardware components for NORTHCOM Spiral 1r activities that include the following brand name network equipment components and end user devices: Dell, Cisco, Juniper, APC, RackMount Solutions, Viasat, and DTECH . These networking components will be utilized in support of CENTRIXS NORTHCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR) activities. MNIS has received validated Joint Staff CENTRIXS NORTHCOM operational requirements to commence Spiral 1r network activities for procurement, configuration, and implementation to provide network centric operational capabilities. CENTRIXS provides enterprise level coalition information sharing services to Combatant Commands, Services, and Agency's (CC/S/As) and requires additional hardware components to comply with Spiral 1r system locations and end user workstation requirements. These networks require additional hardware components to comply with expected system capability metrics for Spiral requirements in austere locations. These products are necessary for contract award 4Q FY2013.

4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: (a) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1). (FAR 6.302-1/DFARS 206.302-1); 5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The proposed hardware is consistent with the established MNIS CENTRIXS baselines at the MNIS Ft. Meade Lab and DECCs/ESCs providing MNIS services. All of the brand names mentioned within this J&A document will reduce infrastructure costs by enabling monitoring of and access to multiple cryptographically isolated CENTRIXS networks from various locations with multiple capacities. If another brand was introduced, additional accreditation testing, based on historical invoice costs and timelines, would result in increased schedule slip of 6-12 months to the Government in duplicative testing costs. Using like hardware eases the requirement load on MNIS personnel by standardizing on hardware products, reducing training requirements, and
Enclosure 12a, J&A (Part 6_12-13.501-15) Page 2 of 4 Pages 04Sept2012/v1.3

enabling MNIS personnel to better matrix staff to support the requirements. In addition, using like hardware enables additional savings by consolidating maintenance support contracts. If any new capabilities or non standard products are introduced, the MNIS PMO would then have to fund initial training as well as the costs associated with the appropriate hardware certifications for these personnel. Costs for hardware certifications can be projected up to $XXX,XXX given current market rates, and would introduce additional schedule slip and costs should these be reaccreditated as previously stated. The DISA Ft. Meade certifiers are familiar with this equipment and have made certification recommendations to the DISA Designated Approving Authority (DAA) for similar equipment in MNIS operational systems at the MNIS DECCs/ESCs. The core components, comprised of Dell high performance laptops, Cisco routers and switches, and Juniper engines will support the same model of previously procured and installed Dell and Cisco components in the CENTRIXS architecture and are the only brands that can function within the designated environment. Should another brand be introduced network failure will occur given the configuration, architecture, and technical settings for this type of equipment providing CENTRIXS network functionality. Utilizing the same configuration is required from an Information Assurance perspective and these integration activities are seamless given prior implementation activities that have occurred with the same equipment procurements over the past 24 months. These components must be stored in the DTECH components, which are ruggedized router and switch encasings that provide for flexibility and transport to allow mobility for combat support areas. DTECH casings ensure the components are safe and secure to protect the highly sensitive IT equipment from corrosive environments, water, sand, and other hostile environments. They are necessary to provide a plug and play environment for connecting networks at different locations through minimal personnel requirements. The Viasat components are crucial for cryptographic capabilities across the network and provide additional security. The Viasat brand is the only brand certified from an Information Assurance (IA) accreditation perspective and DISA requires implementation of these devices should cryptology be a network requirement. These devices are integrated into the network with other components and must be powered by APC smart UPS devices to ensure operational capabilities are satisfied through the correct power requirements. The RackMount Solutions components are racks that connect the network and communications infrastructure devices (e.g., servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc) to include DTECH, Dell, Cisco, Juniper Viasat, and APC powering auxiliary and cabling components that are all necessary support brand name equipment that is certified and accredited to fully implement the RackMount cabinets with main capabilities. Should inconsistencies with brand names be introduced to this environment, system and performance degradation will result in decreased performance metrics and functionality loss. The brand name equipment has been approved for mission operation by the executive level Designated Approving Authority (DAA) for Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). Per DAA direction under the CENTRIXS Authority to Operate (ATO), no other brands other than these specified are allowed to operate within designated enterprise environments. If an exception is not provided under this statutory
Enclosure 12a, J&A (Part 6_12-13.501-15) Page 3 of 4 Pages 04Sept2012/v1.3

clause, the Government and receiving activity will not be able to provide the required, accreditated, and approved equipment to support these CENTRIXS mission requirements in the NORTHCOM Area of Operation resulting in failure to satisfy Joint Staff requirements.

6. FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT/POTENTIAL SOURCES: The Contracting Officer shall post a J&A notice on FEDBIZOPPS no later than 30 days post award. 7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: The Contracting Officer will make a determination that the prices/costs for this acquisition are fair and reasonable based on the comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for like items, comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items and comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) developed for this procurement. 8. MARKET RESEARCH: Market research was conducted by members of the Defense Information Systems Agency's MNIS PMO Implementation Branch (CC42) who are knowledgeable about support services equipment in support of unclassified information sharing operations and coordination based on prior procurement of other CENTRIXS hardware. Sites were searched on the Internet, and historical data reviewed to determine that all brand name equipment required is commercially available. In June-July 2013, the Spiral 1requipment list was sent to four small business Value Added Resellers (VARs) to ascertain if they are capable of providing the required hardware components due to the fact these companies were all awarded contracts in Q2 and Q3 FY13 that included brand name components of these supply contracts. The contract numbers awarded in Q2-Q3 FY13 are: HC1047-C-13-4012, HC1047-13-P-0106, HC1047-13-P-0134, HC1047-13-P-0118, and HC1047-13-P-0084. 9. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: None. 10. LISTING OF INTERESTED SOURCES: Five small businesses have expressed, in writing, an interest in the procurement. 11. ACTIONS THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE EXCEPTION TO FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. Should products other than the brands mentioned throughout this J&A become commercially available with similar capabilities and become approved or qualified for integration during the performance of the contract as authorized by this J&A, additional brand name or equal sources will be considered for future needs. 12.
