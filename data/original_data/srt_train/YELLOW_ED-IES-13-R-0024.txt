2. Mission The mission of ERIC is to provide broad access to education research in a user-friendly, timely, and efficient manner. ERIC provides these services to schools, institutions of higher education, educators (including early childhood educators), parents, administrators, policymakers, researchers, public and private entities (including providers of early childhood services), entities responsible for carrying out technical assistance through the Department, and the general public. ERIC has sought to accomplish this mission through the development and maintenance of a comprehensive, searchable, Internet-based library of bibliographic references and associated fulltext, when such text is freely available. 3. Background ERIC is the world's largest and most frequently used digital library of education resources. It is comprised of more than 1.4 million bibliographic records and more than 450,000 full-text materials indexed from 1966 to the present. Each ERIC bibliographic record contains an abstract of a journal article or non-journal document (e.g., technical report, conference paper), along with indexed information such as author, title, and publication date. A government-sponsored website <www.eric.ed.gov> provides free access to the ERIC digital library. ERIC is also re-distributed under terms of a license agreement. Various subscription services and freely available Internet search engines provide access to ERIC. Several statewide information networks (Ohio, Texas, Kentucky, and North Carolina), regional consortia, international services providers, and large university systems also provide access to ERIC. Acquisition agreements with journal publishers and education membership associations, education organizations, universities, state education agencies, and other sources of non-journal materials provide source materials for the ERIC digital library. The ERIC database contains citations included in the digital library and is updated weekly. Approximately 4,000 new entries are added per month. ERIC indexes over 1,000 journals comprehensively (i.e., all articles are included) and approximately 100 journals are indexed selectively (i.e., only articles related to education are indexed). In addition, ERIC includes socalled "gray literature" sources (materials not published by commercial publishers). Individual authors are invited to contribute their full-text documents, abstracts, and bibliographic data to

2

Attachment A

ERIC through an online submission system; these documents are considered for inclusion in the ERIC database. There are approximately 13 million searches of ERIC each month. Currently, users are able to search for resources using the well-developed ERIC thesaurus and a variety of search limiters. Users can refine their search by author, audience, source, education level, publication type, peer review status, and the availability of full text. ED anticipates keeping the current functionality of the ERIC website, while making improvements to the ERIC search function, when it launches a redesigned ERIC website in early August 2013. Additionally, this contract will develop a new IES website where ERIC will be fully integrated to the Agency's website to reduce duplication of effort. For the duration of this contract, the ERIC website will be hosted on ED servers and future IES websites will be hosted on ED servers. 4. Authorizing Legislation Section 172 (a) 3 of Public Law 107-279, Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, which creates the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), requires that the Commissioner for the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance "make ... information accessible in a userfriendly, timely, and efficient manner (including through the use of a searchable Internet-based online database)... " Section 172 (b) 1 of the Act also requires the Commissioner to "ensure that information [is] disseminated ... in a cost-effective, non-duplicative manner." Section 172 of the Education Sciences Reform Act specifies that dissemination include information on closing the achievement gap, education practices that improve academic achievement and promote learning, and topics that were covered by the former ERIC clearinghouses: adult, career, and vocational education; community colleges; assessment and evaluation; higher education; teaching and teacher education; information and technology; counseling and student services; educational management; elementary and early childhood education; reading, English, and communication; science, mathematics, and environmental education; social studies/social science education; rural education and small schools; urban education; disabilities and gifted education; and languages and linguistics. According to Section 172 of the Education Sciences Reform Act, the information must be accessible "to schools, institutions of higher education, educators (including early childhood educators), parents, administrators, policymakers, researchers, public and private entities (including providers of early childhood services), entities responsible for carrying out technical assistance through the Department, and the general public." 5. Scope of Work The mission of ERIC is to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-use, searchable, Internet-based bibliographic and full-text database of education research and information for educators, researchers, and the general public. Terms defining the ERIC mission are explained as follows:

3

Attachment A



Comprehensive: The ERIC digital library consists of journal articles and nonjournal materials, including materials not published by commercial publishers that are directly related to education and education research. Easy-to-use and searchable: A variety of ERIC users ­ including students, educators, researchers, and the general public - will be able to find the education information they need quickly and efficiently. Electronic: ERIC is an entirely electronic system comprised of the ERIC website at http://www.eric.ed.gov and the digital library. It will link to libraries, publishers, and commercial sources of journal articles; and will be made available to commercial database vendors through authorization agreements. Bibliographic and full-text: Bibliographic records will convey the information users need in a simple and straightforward manner, and whenever possible, full-text journal articles and non-journal materials will be included free in the digital library. Other full-text articles and materials, whenever possible, will be immediately available for purchase through an online link to the publisher's website.







6. Contractor Security Requirements ED has established policy on personnel security screening for all contractor and subcontractor employees and their field staff. The relevant Departmental Directive is OM:5-101. It was last updated in July 2010 and can be found at: http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/acsom5101.pdf . The contractor must comply with the personnel security-screening requirements in OM:5-101 throughout the life of the contract. All contractor and subcontractor employees must undergo personnel security screening if they will be employed for thirty (30) days or more. The type of screening and the timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data the contractor employee will have access to or the type of ED IT system they will access. Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause to ED or the public. A position risk level will be assigned to each contractor employee position, before a solicitation is released, consistent with the descriptions in Appendix I of OM:5-101. Hence, each contractor employee working on this contract must be assigned a position risk level. Depending on the risk level assigned to each person's position, a follow-up background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may occur. The contractor must identify one of their employees as a security liaison for this process. This Contractor Security Liaison coordinates the distribution, collection, and dissemination of various forms required in this process. They answer general questions from their employees on completing the security screening process. And, they are the first point of contact for contractor employees in using the OPM's internet based security screening portal called the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) ( http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/ ). The

4

Attachment A

contractor is also responsible for ensuring that all subcontractors follow these personnel security screening procedures. IES requires each contractor employee to have or apply for a clearance for the security level designated for the position held on a contract. Contractor employees who have undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency will be required to submit proof of that personnel security screening for validation. For these employees, the contractor or subcontractor must follow these required steps: 1. The contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name of each employee with a pre-existing clearance, the agency that cleared the employee, the level of the clearance, and the date of the clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an IES contract. 2. In those cases where any of the required information on level of clearance, agency that cleared the employee and date of clearance is not available, the contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name and Social Security Number for each employee with a pre-existing clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an IES contract. 3. The COR will transmit the letter to the IES Security Representative for processing. 4. The IES Security Representative reviews the letter to ensure that the required information is provided and either returns it to the contractor for completion or releases it to ED's Chief of Personnel Security. The contractor must resubmit the letter to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract. 5. The IES Security Representative will notify the contractor or subcontractor if the pre-existing clearance was identified and ruled to be acceptable by ED's Chief of Personnel Security. 6. Those employees whose pre-existing clearances are not verified and approved must follow the process outlined next to apply for a security clearance. For contractor employees who have not undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency, all contractors must comply with the Principal Office (PO) Executive Office or Computer Security Officer's pre-processing requirements for personnel security screening and granting access privileges. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (i.e., personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have submitted applicable security screening documents. The security screening of contractor and subcontractor employees not holding ED recognized security screening credentials must follow these required steps: 1. The contractor must provide the COR with an electronic listing of all employees on a specific contract, with the risk level associated with the position held by each employee as specified

5

Attachment A

in the contract solicitation. The COR will review the electronic listing for completeness and approve. The listing will not be approved if it is found to be incomplete. 2. ED's participates in the OPM e-QIP system to facilitate the security screening process for contractor employees. IES will initiate an e-QIP account for each contractor employee. It is advisable to request the account initiation three (3) weeks before the contractor employee starts contract work. For the initiation of these accounts, the Contractor Security Liaison must use the COR-approved list of employees and the risk levels assigned to the employees' positions to produce and submit the following list using the attached template: a. For each contractor employee provide: Social Security Number, Full Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth, risk level, e-Mail Address, and phone number. The Contractor Security Liaison must place the spreadsheet in a password protected file, then upload the list to the IES secure server, and send an e-mail notification of the transmission to the IES Security Representative. The IES security staff will use this list to establish the contactor employee e-QIP accounts. The COR will work with the contractor to establish access to the IES secure server at the outset of the contract. b. Once IES sets up the e-QIP accounts for contract employees, the IES Security Representative will send an email to the Contractor Security Liaison stating that the employee has an active account on the e-QIP system. The COR is copied on this email notification. c. The Contractor Security Liaison must notify their employees of this active account. A computer with Internet access and web browsing software is required for the contractor employee to access their E-QIP account. Each employee must log into their personal account in e-QIP, enter the requested information, finish the application process and print, sign, and date the e-QIP signature pages. 3. Each contractor employee must submit a completed set of security screening forms to their Contractor Security Liaison as provided by the IES Security Representative, including for example: a. The signed and dated e-QIP signature pages, b. The Declaration of Federal Employment (OPM form OF-306), c. The Fair Credit Release Form,

d. The Request for Security Officer Action (RSA) Form, 1) The contractor employee shall complete only those items in section 1 of the form (name, date of birth, place of birth, organization, position title, duty station, social security number, and work phone number). 2) The contractor shall complete section 5 (Project Requiring Highest ADP Level) using the assigned security clearance for each employee's position. e. Two sets of fingerprints on separate copies of form FD-258,

6

Attachment A

1) The Contractor Security Liaison shall help arrange fingerprinting for each contractor and subcontractor employee. Fingerprinting can usually be done at a local police station. (Electronic fingerprints are not accepted at this time.) 4. Each contractor must ensure that the forms are complete and that all contractor employee required security screening forms are transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of an employee starting work on an IES contract. a. The Contractor Security Liaison must collate the forms in each security screening package by employee and transmit a complete set of security screening documents for each employee to the COR via courier (e.g., Federal Express) using a tracking number with signature required, b. The COR will not accept security screening packages that are not collated by employee (i.e., all forms noted in point 3 above will be bundled by employee). The COR will review all security screening documents for each contractor employee for completeness, returning any incomplete security screening documents to the Contractor Security Liaison for completion. The contractor must resubmit the completed security screening documents to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have resubmitted applicable screening documents. 5. The COR will submit the completed packages of security screening documents to the IES Security Representative for processing. 6. The IES Security Representative reviews each package of security screening documents and electronic information submission to ensure everything required has been provided and either rejects the package, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to ED's Chief of Personnel Security. In the event that an application is rejected at this stage, the contractor must resubmit the corrected forms to the COR, or have the contractor employee correct the e-QIP submission, within two business days. The IES Security Representative must be notified as soon as the updated e-QIP submission is completed. 7. The contractor employee application for each individual in a moderate risk level position must be submitted to ED's Chief of Personnel Security within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. 8. After a package of security screening documents is transmitted to ED Chief of Personnel Security, the Office of Management security staff conducts a further review and either rejects the package of security screening documents, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to OPM. 9. OPM then assigns an investigator to conduct the type of investigation indicated by the department (this is tied to the level of access to PII that the applicant will have). 10. The Chief of Personnel Security will request the expansion of background investigations to obtain additional information to the extent necessary to make personnel acceptability or

7

Attachment A

suitability determinations. These determinations will be made using criteria established by the OPM for the purpose of determining suitability for employment in the Federal competitive service, as described in 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 731.202, and other OPM guidance as applicable. The Chief of Personnel Security determines whether a contractor employee is acceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint. 11. When the OPM investigation is complete, the RSA form with the clearance indicated is sent to ED's Office of Management for processing. 12. The Office of Management returns the RSA form to the IES Security Representative for recordation and distribution to the COR. 13. The COR transmits the RSA form with clearance indicated to the Contractor Security Liaison for their records and for distribution to the Contract Project Leader. 14. The Contract Project Leader then distributes copies of the clearance to the employee. 15. The Chief of Personnel Security will inform the IES COR when he or she determines that a contractor employee is not acceptable to render service(s) or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under a contract. 16. Each contractor will officially notify its contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on an ED contract. 17. In the event a contractor employee is deemed unacceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint, the Chief of Personnel Security will usually provide the contractor employee with an opportunity to refute, explain, clarify, or mitigate information in question. 18. If, after final determination by the Chief of Personnel Security, a decision is made that the contractor employee is not acceptable to render services on a contract and access is denied, the COR will inform the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer must inform the contractor (i.e. employing firm) that the contractor employee is not acceptable to render services in this particular position, or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under the contract. The contractor will notify the contractor employee. A final determination cannot be appealed. 19. At any time during the life of the contract a contractor or subcontractor employee (including any field staff) discontinues work on the contract or leaves the employment of the contractor, the contractor shall notify the COR within two days of the date that the employee is no longer working on the contract or within one business day if removed for cause. The contractor shall provide the reason why the employee is no longer working on the contract. The COR will provide this information to the IES Security Representative. 20. Each contractor is responsible for the protection of sensitive or Privacy Act-protected information from unauthorized use or misuse by its employees, subcontractors, or temporary workers, and for preventing access to others, who are not authorized and have no need to know such information. 21. The contractor shall submit monthly information to the COR indicating which employees were billed to the contract that include the e-QIP number of the person being billed. The

8

Attachment A

COR will reject payments to employees without an e-QIP number. For employees with preexisting clearances from other contracts, this shall be noted on the monthly payment form. The contractor shall verify with the COR that the security screening processes have not changed by the time the contract is active. 7. Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Although the IES webteam will be doing all development of the ERIC website and the IES website, the contractor shall provide COTS solutions that are IPv6 capable. An IPv6 capable system or product shall be capable of receiving, processing, transmitting and forwarding IPv6 packets and/or interfacing with other systems and protocols in a manner similar to that of IPv4. Specific criteria to be deemed IPv6 capable are: An IPv6 Capable system must meet the IPv6 base requirements defined by the USGv6 Profile and Testing program as found here "http://w3.antd.nist.gov/usgv6/testing.html". Systems being developed, procured or acquired shall maintain interoperability with IPv4 systems/capabilities. Systems shall implement IPv4/IPv6dual-stack and shall also be built to determine which protocol layer to use depending on the destination host it is attempting to communicate with or establish a socket with. If either protocol is possible, systems shall employ IPv6. The contractor shall provide IPv6 technical support for system development, implementation and management System Development Standards: Information systems shall be developed in accordance with the ED Lifecycle Management Framework (LCM), ACS-OCIO 1-106 Task 1. COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT (Fixed Priced) The contractor shall manage all aspects of the ERIC digital library, drawing on staff positions included in the proposal and experts as needed for consultation and advice in the areas of content acquisition; knowledge utilization; and digital libraries to implement the ERIC mission. 1.1. Kickoff Meeting. Within the first 5 business days after the contract start date, key personnel shall attend a kickoff meeting with ED to discuss details regarding the tasks outlined in the proposal, scheduling activities, and other issues related to the contract. The meeting will be held at the Department's offices in Washington, D.C. The Contractor shall provide an agenda for the meeting within 3 business days after the contract start date. The Contractor shall come prepared

Deliverables:  Monthly report--5th business day of every month

Task 2. REDESIGNING THE CONTENT OF THE IES WEBSITE (Cost Reimbursement)

10

Attachment A

The current IES website is comprised of several individual websites, including ies.ed.gov, nces.ed.gov, wwc.ed.gov, eric.ed.gov, nationsreportcard.ed.gov, and childstats.ed.gov. Sites like childstats.ed.gov and eric.ed.gov are designed to give the public information from statistical or bibliographic databases, while ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov provide information about the programs and offices hosted by IES. The nces.ed.gov and ies.ed.gov websites are separate sites for solely due to NCES, and its website, being created prior to IES being created. Although separate, the ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov sites are designed to work together as a single entity to provide information about the four centers in IES: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE), National Center for Education Research (NCER), and National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). Information about NCEE, NCER, and NCSER falls under the ies.ed.gov site, along with information about crosscenter collaboration and the IES administration. Information about the programs in NCES falls under the nces.ed.gov site and nces.ed.gov sites are linked to as a sub-section of the ies.ed.gov site. These sites contain webpages for each division and program in each center, as well as links to the publications funded or produced by the center. A current, high-level sitemap is shown in Figure 1, below. Figure 1.

This task asks the contractor to redesign the content for the ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov sites and to create the content for a new section of the ERIC website. The contractor shall build upon the ERIC database, the ERIC thesaurus, and ERIC's expertise in dissemination and organization of information to reorganize the content found on the ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov for users unfamiliar with the mission, activities, and products of IES. The redesigned websites shall be redesigned in a way that will help users easily find information in an intuitive manner. This will

12

Attachment A

better enable education practitioners, researchers, students, policymakers, and the general public find relevant information about key education topics. There shall be new pages for each of the four centers and programs within the centers, a new filterable search feature, a new graphical design, and a new structuring of the webpages in the site. The redesigned websites shall contain information that is currently available on the websites, such as information for each publication, research program, and grant. The contractor shall work with representatives at IES to rewrite the content of the page to be in plain language and to be organized in a manner that is useful to those unfamiliar with IES. The contractor shall include links to related publications and programs across the center and in different centers. The technology that supports the nces.ed.gov website is very complex and many ideas that the contractor may assume to be technically feasible may not be possible. Therefore, multiple rounds of revisions may be required to achieve the final design. Additionally, the contractor shall assume that multiple rounds of review will be required by IES leadership at various stages of the project. The COR will facilitate the review process. The contractor shall develop the content for a user-friendly section of the ERIC site which contains information across the centers by topic area. This website shall operate in conjunction with the existing ERIC digital library to help users identify resources by type and topic area. It shall capture the content found on the ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov sites and organize it in a way that enables users to access the information through various categories of interest. 2.1 Developing Content for a Practitioner Friendly Section of the ERIC Website. The contractor shall develop a new section of the ERIC website to provide information and resources to practitioners, policymakers, and students by topic area. The information shall be displayed in a graphically pleasing manner that will help users find relevant publications of interest that are stored in ERIC. The content and structure of the website shall be created by the ERIC contractor, while the development and hosting of the website will be done by IES. This page shall be designed to help increase usability of ERIC. A recent analysis of usability data found that there are over 56,300 unique visitors to ERIC per day. Most visitors are directed to an ERIC article through a search engine and only 13.5% of users visit the website more than once a month. The median ERIC user is only on the website for one minute and forty seconds and the average user is on the page for a little over six minutes. This suggests that many users are not finding what they need and are exiting the page quickly. An analysis of the types of materials requested by ERIC users found that many users are trying to access material that is out of date and from non-peer reviewed sources. Adding a practitioners section of the website will help the site become more user-friendly and will highlight recent, peer reviewed work that is may be useful to novice ERIC users. It will also help guide searches by topic area to increase the likelihood of users finding the information they are looking for. 2.1.1 Identification of topics and subtopics. The contractor shall work with subject matter experts to identify 15 topics to be covered in ERIC and between 5 and 10 subtopics for each topic. The topics shall include all of the topics covered in IES's

13

Attachment A

authorizing legislation: adult, career, and vocational education; community colleges; assessment and evaluation; higher education; teaching and teacher education; information and technology; counseling and student services; educational management; elementary and early childhood education; reading, English, and communication; science, mathematics, and environmental education; social studies/social science education; rural education and small schools; urban education; disabilities and gifted education; and languages and linguistics. However, the topics may be renamed, expanded, or combined to cover other highly relevant topics as well. For example, the topic of community colleges could become a subtopic of higher education. A special effort shall be made to include topics covered by research centers funded by NCER (listed here: http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/projects/) and NCSER (listed here: http://ies.ed.gov/ncser/projects/). Additionally, the topic areas should address the priority areas for the Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs), which are early childhood education; identifying and retaining effective teachers and principals; adopting and implementing rigorous academic standards and assessments; increasing college readiness, access, and completion; and improving low-achieving schools. Each topic and its subtopics shall each receive its own webpage on the new section of the ERIC website. The contractor shall include a potential list of topics and subtopics in the proposal and shall provide a revised list to the COR within 4 weeks of award. The COR will provide written feedback. If a topic or subtopic is not approved, the contractor shall provide an alternate within 2 weeks of COR feedback. Deliverables: o List of topics and subtopics--4 weeks after contract award o List of alternate topics and subtopics--2 weeks after disapproval of original topics and/or subtopics by the COR

2.1.2 Identifying subject matter experts. The contractor shall identify and recruit a team of up to 20 subject matter experts who are experts on the proposed topics and subtopics. Proposed subject matter experts shall have demonstrated expertise in their subject area through scholarly publication on the specific content area. Special consideration shall be given to subject matter experts who have produced work funded by IES, either through contracted work or grants. The contractor shall submit a list of proposed subject matter experts, their curricula vitae, and a writing sample from each proposed expert geared to a general audience to the COR for approval within 6 weeks of award. If a proposed expert is not approved, the contractor shall propose an alternate within 2 weeks of COR feedback. Deliverables: o List of subject matter experts--6 weeks after contract award List of alternate subject matter experts--2 weeks after disapproval of originally proposed subject matter experts by the COR

14

Attachment A

2.1.3 Topic summaries. Each topic shall contain an approximately 2,000 word overview of the topic written by the subject matter expert. The topic overview shall synthesize the results and findings of the topic, the key terminology, and how each of the subtopics relates to central topic. Each overview shall be written for a general audience and use plain language, per Public Law 111­274. The summaries shall include linked citations to at least 25 relevant ERIC full text articles on the topic and subtopics, with priority given to IES funded research. An example of a topic summary is included in the appendix. The contractor shall submit drafts of the topic overviews at the rate of one overview every other week starting at week 13. The contractor shall expect extensive feedback from the COR on initial drafts to help improve the quality of the writing and the content, if necessary.

A review of the IES and NCES website conducted under a previous contract found that ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov users found the websites provided useful and comprehensive information, but the level of writing was geared towards researchers and academics, there was too much text, the text was too tight, and paragraphs were too long. In analyzing usage data, 78% of users were on the website for less than a minute and the majority of users did not access site subpages to see what information was provided. It was evident that users could not find what the information they were searching for and left the site. With 6,500 unique visitors a day to the ies.ed.gov website and 46,500 unique visitors per day to the nces.ed.gov website, the data suggests that there are 41,340 users each day who leave the website without finding the information they were searching for. The contractor shall use this

16

research, found in the appendix, to inform their proposed redesign of the ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov websites. The contractor shall review all pages at the ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov websites to redesign the content and organization of the websites. The new websites shall focus on research produced by IES centers and their divisions and programs, but shall also make connections of how the work produced is related to work done in other centers and across IES. Information shall be displayed in a format that will help users unfamiliar with IES and the field of education to easily find information. The text of the website shall be written for a broad audience of policy makers, students, researchers, and educators. It shall use plain language, per Public Law 111­274. Currently, IES publishes IES produced work on the IES website, and then a month later the same article is published in ERIC. This is a duplication of work that will be reduced under this task and Task 4.4.3.1. Under Task 4.4.3.1, ERIC will add all IES records to ERIC prior to the publication being released. This task will link all IES publications to their ERIC entry, as opposed to the current landing page. In order for ERIC to disseminate timely research, the redesigned websites shall contain links to the ERIC full text document of all work produced by the centers, instead of the current linking to a separate IES publication page. For example, this IES publication (http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/pacific/pdf/REL_20134002.pdf) would no longer be hosted at the ies.ed.gov address. Instead, it would be linked to at the ERIC address (http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED538073.pdf). This shall reduce duplication of effort and shall direct more users to ERIC. The websites shall also have an improved search function to direct users to relevant studies by being able to narrow and expand searches by relevant fields. The contractor shall build upon the ERIC thesaurus to create the tool and to organize the taxonomy of the website. The contractor shall consider the Find What Works (http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/findwhatworks.aspx) search function and the filtering tool on the MDRC website (http://www.mdrc.org/) in the proposed design. The content and organization of the website shall be created by the contractor, while the coding and hosting of the website will be done by IES. The contractor shall work in conjunction with the IES web team to ensure the contractor's proposed design is feasible. The contractor shall review the ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov websites and provide a summary of key strengths and weaknesses 4 weeks after contract award. The review should include strengths and weaknesses for each center and program and should provide concrete recommendations for improvement. The COR will discuss the summary report with the contractor and it shall be used to frame the discussion of redevelopment with the working groups discussed in Task 2.3. Deliverables:  Summary of strengths and weaknesses with recommendations for improvement--4 weeks after contract award. 2.3. Development of the websites. The contractor shall design the content and the structure of a website to display the information in Task 2.1 and Task 2.2 in a useful and informative manner.

U.S. Department of Education Institute of Education Sciences QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) Tracking No. erte10038b Introduction This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) sets forth procedures and guidelines that the Department of Education will use to monitor performance of the Contractor under this contract. A copy of this plan will be furnished to the contractor so that the contractor shall be aware of the methods that the Government will employ in monitoring performance on this project and address any concerns that the contractor may have prior to initiating work. Purpose of the QASP The QASP is intended to accomplish the following:  Define the roles and responsibilities of participating Government officials and outside experts; and  Describe the process of quality assurance surveillance. Each of these purposes is discussed in detail below. Roles and Responsibilities of Participating Government Officials The following Government Officials will participate in assessing the quality of the contractor's performance. Their roles and responsibilities are described as follows: Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR will be responsible for monitoring, assessing, recording, and reporting on the technical performance of the contractor on a day-to-day basis. The COR will also be responsible for inspecting all deliverables submitted under this contract and providing a recommendation regarding the acceptability of the deliverable to the Contracting Officer. It is essential that the COR establish and maintain a team-oriented line of communication with the Contractor's Project Director (PD) in order to perform monitoring functions. The COR, CO, and PD must work together as a team to ensure that required work is accomplished in an efficient and proper manner. Meetings should be held on a regular basis in order to resolve serious problems. Less serious problems should be discussed and resolved on an impromptu basis. The Contracting Officer (CO) will have overall responsibility for overseeing the contractor's performance. The Contract Specialist will be responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the contractor's performance in the areas of compliance, administration, cost control and property control; reviewing the COR's assessment of the contractor's performance; and resolving all differences between the COR's version and the contractor's version. The CO may call upon the expertise of other Government individuals as required.

Attachment B
Quality Assurance Surveillance Process The Department of Education will use a quality assurance review process to monitor the contractor's performance under this contract through the contract deliverables, specifically through a review of the timeliness of submission and the acceptability of the content of each deliverable. The COR will inspect each deliverable and recommend acceptance of the deliverable to the Contracting Officer. In the event the COR has a concern regarding the timeliness or quality of the content of a deliverable, the contractor shall be notified as well as the Contracting Officer shall be notified. The Contractor's performance shall be documented and measured through the annual past performance evaluation through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Performance will be evaluated in the areas of:      Quality of Product or Service Schedule Cost Control Business Relations Management of Key Personnel

The following rating elements will be used to evaluate each area: Rating Definition Exceptional Performance meets all contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or subelement being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor were highly effective. Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or subelement being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor were effective. Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor appear or were satisfactory. Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the Contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the Contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the Contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

ED-IES-13-R-0024 Billing Instructions The Department wants all of our contractors to understand how the Department processes invoices (see Note at the bottom of this page). The basic rule is this; we pay you within 15 days of receipt of a proper invoice. There are two key terms that determine when the clock starts--receipt and proper invoice. Receipt occurs on the latter of: 1) Invoices are transmitted electronically through email (OCFOCAMInvoicing@ed.gov), we look for the date a readable transmission is received by our office, or if it is received after normal working hours we will use the next business day. 2) The seventh day after the date on which the property is actually delivered or the performance of services is actually completed. This date may not be accurate if the contract calls for a longer acceptance period or if we actually accept goods or services before the seventh day. (5 CFR § 1315.4) 3) On the date of delivery, if specified in the contract. 4) On the date placed on the invoice by the contractor, if we fail to annotate the date of receipt in our office. An invoice is deemed proper when: We receive your invoice containing the following information: 1) Name of vendor 2) Invoice date 3) Government contract number (10 digits) 4) Vendor invoice number, account number, or other number identified in the contract 5) Description (including, for example, contract line/subline number), price, and quantity of goods or services rendered. 6) Shipping and payment terms (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 7) TIN (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 8) Banking information for payment by EFT (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 9) Contact name (where practicable), title and telephone number 10) Other substantiating documentation or information required by the contract. This documentation should include information regarding where the requested funds were spent. We need to see detailed labor hours per task, travel expenses (where travelers went, transportation costs, etc.), supplies purchased, etc. If The Department determines that your invoice is not proper, we will return it to you and identify all defects that prevent payment. You should correct the invoice and return it to us for payment. NOTE--There is a difference between an invoice and a voucher. Since the FAR refers to "proper invoices" when applying the Prompt Payment Act, we will use the term invoice also. This does not mean that vouchers are not covered in the same manner.

Attachment E

Item # 10 above is, in our experience, the most problematic for our contractors. The following explanation may help you to think about the types of information to include in your invoices/vouchers. According to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 16.301-3, paragraph (a)(2), a cost-reimbursement contract requires, "Appropriate Government surveillance during the performance [that] will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used." This "surveillance" not only comes in the form of monthly reports, but more importantly, in invoicing. You have the responsibility to request reimbursement of your recorded costs; in other words, to submit an invoice on a regular basis. FAR 52.216-7, paragraph (b) defines the term costs to include the following: materials issued from the contractor's inventory and placed in the production process for use on the contract; direct labor; direct travel; other direct in-house costs; and reasonable, allocable, and allowable indirect costs (see FAR 31), as shown in the records maintained by you for purposes of obtaining reimbursement under a Government contract. The Government has the responsibility to pay the invoice, after determining which of the costs are reasonable, allocable, and allowable. To make this determination we must receive a detailed invoice with the costs broken out.

Attachment F

ED-IES-13-R-0024 3459.209-70 (CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION - May 2011) Offerors shall complete the following Conflict of Interest Certificate and include it in their business proposal. A Conflict of Interest Certificate is also required from any proposed subcontractor and/or consultant. a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person`s objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products,

1

Attachment F property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (f) Conflict of Interest Certification. The offeror, ____________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. __________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including

2

Attachment F conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government`s satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

OCIO:1-106 I. Introduction

Page 2 of 25 (07/16/2010)

The U.S. Department of Education (Department) LCM Framework (Framework) describes the management process that is to be used by Department components engaged in the acquisition and development of information technology (IT) solutions. The Framework describes the key activities, deliverables and reviews an IT solution moves through over the course of its lifecycle. The Framework is designed to coordinate and integrate Department processes that impact IT solutions acquisition and development. II. Purpose This directive sets forth the Department's policy for using the Department's LCM Framework to provide the foundation for the implementation of standards, processes and procedures for acquiring and developing IT solutions. All LCM- related processes will use the Framework to align and streamline their processes to support effective oversight and management of IT solution acquisition and development. III. Policy This directive applies to the development, acquisition, implementation, maintenance and disposal of IT solutions regardless of cost, complexity and time constraints. IV. Authorization The following are links to Federal regulations and policies that support the Department's use of a LCM approach:     Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Clinger-Cohen Act); Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123 OMB Circular A-130 U.S. Department of Education Investment Review Board Charter

The Department's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) will own and maintain the Framework; communicate it to the Principal Offices; and provide support for its implementation. V. Applicability This directive applies to all Department employees and contractors engaged in the development, acquisition, implementation, maintenance and disposal of IT solutions. Nothing in this directive is meant to excuse or exempt contractors from satisfying all requirements of their contracts. VI. Definitions The following are key definitions related to this directive. A. Lifecycle Management (LCM) is the coordination of activities associated with the documentation and implementation of IT solutions from conception through disposal. Such activities include: defining requirements, designing, building, testing, implementing, establishing operations and disposing of systems.

OCIO:1-106

Page 3 of 25 (07/16/2010)

B. Framework is a structured approach of required stages, key activities and core deliverables that provides a foundation for aligning existing interrelated processes within the Department, regardless of system lifecycle methodology employed. C. Enterprise Architecture Advisory Committee (EAAC) is the Department's governance body that advises the Chief Enterprise Architect on enterprise architecture (EA) programmatic policies and issues, business/IT strategic planning support, and information and artifacts related to the creation, maintenance and use of EA within the Department. The EAAC also provides advice and recommendations regarding the Department's IT portfolio to the Planning and Investment Review Working Group (PIRWG). D. Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB) is the Department's governance body that performs technical reviews to assess (1) EA standards compliance, (2) technical design, and (3) opportunities for service and technical component standards reuse. The EARB also serves as a committee supporting the EAAC. E. Change Advisory Board (CAB) is the Department's governance body that reviews, approves and implements change requests for the EDUCATE IT Infrastructure. F. IT Solution pertains to automated information systems, software applications, and manual processes. G. Stage is a definitive section of the lifecycle that indicates a specific purpose or goal has been achieved. The end of each stage is marked by a "Stage Gate," noting the exit from one stage and entry into the next. H. Key Activity is a required task, procedure or process. I. Core Deliverable is a required document that must be completed and approved by the end of a particular stage of the lifecycle.

J. Exit /Entry Criteria refers to requirements that must be completed and approved in order to exit one stage and enter the next. K. Stage Gate Review is the integration of various business and technical reviews performed primarily by the EARB that ensures core deliverables (and any additional deliverables) required for that stage have been completed. VII. Responsibilities The following are staff responsibilities associated with this directive: A. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for authorizing the development and implementation of an LCM Framework and IT Governance Process that ensures Department IT Solutions Development is managed in accordance with Department standards and procedures. The CIO monitors the execution of the IT Governance process, approving the decisions of the IT governance bodies, and adjudicating disputes that may arise between the IT governance bodies and Project Managers.

OCIO:1-106

Page 4 of 25 (07/16/2010)

B. Enterprise Architecture staff is responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining the LCM Framework and IT Governance process on behalf of the CIO and for reviewing IT investments for adherence to the Department's enterprise architecture current and future state vision. C. Project Managers are responsible for creating deliverables and ensuring that business and technical reviews are executed and required deliverables are completed. They are also responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the Department's IT solutions. D. Deliverable Reviewers are responsible for reviewing and approving the content of required deliverables. Deliverable Reviewers are staff from various business and technical areas (e.g. Investment Acquisition Management Team (IAMT), Contracts and Acquisition Management (CAM)) with specific knowledge of the requirement areas. E. EARB Members are responsible for authorizing a project's progress into the next LCM stage based on the completion of reviews and deliverables required by the preceding LCM stage. VIII. The Framework The Framework is a structured approach of required stages, key activities and core deliverables that provides a foundation for aligning existing interrelated processes such as, the OCIO's IT Governance and Capital Planning and Investment Control processes, OCFO's Acquisition process and processes associated with project management, used in delivering IT solutions. The purpose of the Framework is to help existing Department processes work together more efficiently. It is not intended to reengineer existing processes, but rather, to provide a foundation and frame of reference for aligning them. Staff from various processes related to LCM will be responsible for determining the particulars of how their processes will work within the Framework. In aligning processes, the Framework provides the basis for executing enforcement mechanisms already contained in those processes. Through a stage gate review, the Framework focuses on results obtained at the end of each stage to assist investment oversight, product quality and compliance to Department directives and regulations. However, these stage gate reviews do not represent an additional enforcement layer, but rather are a means to facilitate and coordinate business and technical reviews for each stage already present in existing processes. The Framework is flexible concerning core deliverable length and the addition of deliverables to accommodate solutions with varying cost, complexity and time constraints. All Framework activities and core deliverables are required for Non-Major IT projects1; however, the total documentation for a very small project might amount to just one or two pages, for example. Additionally, project staff should rely on existing Department guidance documents and staff expertise relevant to small projects to determine how those projects should align and work within the Framework.

Please refer to Investment Management Process Guide for a description of Non-Major IT. Also see ACS Directive OCIO:3108 referenced in Appendix D of this directive.

By using this Framework directive, the Department will realize the following benefits:       A single reference to inform Department employees of expectations, activities and core deliverables associated with IT solutions acquisition and development. Improved product quality and reduced rework by establishing standard business and technical reviews throughout the development of IT solutions. Improved oversight by encouraging and enabling integrated and coordinated reviews. Improved performance management of projects through review of project cost and schedule in alignment with the Department's mission or objectives. A mechanism by which projects can define their deliverables against the scope of the IT solution. Improved quality of information used in the IT investment process.

The Framework is comprised of six stages: 1) Vision; 2) Definition; 3) Construction and Validation; 4) Implementation; 5) Support and Improvement; and 6) Retirement. Each stage consists of required key activities and core deliverables that must be completed for entry into the next stage. A stage gate review is conducted by the EARB at designated points in the LCM Framework to ensure the key activities, core deliverables, and any additional deliverables required for that stage have been completed. Any deviations from this process must be approved in writing by the CIO. Appendix A is an acronym list and Appendix B, a glossary. A detailed illustration of the Framework, Departmental document references and a template for the Tailored Project Guide can be found in Appendices C-E respectively. The content of the appendices is "for information purposes only" and serves as guidance for those using this directive. Appendix C is a visual portrayal of the required stages, key activities and deliverables described in this directive. In this document, the Framework stages are designated by a number followed by supporting information for each stage. The sections in the text are numbered to correspond to the six stages of the Framework. Key activities and core deliverables for each stage are explained in text format. Supporting detail for each core deliverable within a particular stage is contained in tables. The tables support the bulleted list of core deliverables in each stage by providing detail that better explains each deliverable. Below is key information regarding each stage of the Framework. 1. VISION STAGE The purpose of the Vision Stage is to develop a business case, necessary acquisition planning documents for the procurement of services and resources to build new IT solutions or improve existing IT assets and high-level requirements for the new system. During this process, the feasibility and cost of the project will be assessed. The Vision Stage contains the following key activities:

OCIO:1-106    

Page 6 of 25 (07/16/2010)

Identify needs and define project scope, define high-level requirements and prepare business case. Obtain appropriate reviews and approvals for the business case. This will include the OCIO's IAMT staff ensuring that the business case aligns with the Department's IT investment objectives. Obtain review and approval of acquisition planning activities. The CAM office will review and approve all acquisition documents. Obtain necessary technical reviews and approvals for the project, as envisioned. The OCIO's EARB, Security, Regulatory Information Management Services (RIMS), PIRWG, EA and Information Assurance (IA) are examples of staff that would participate in the review and approval activities.

3452.209-71

CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MAY 2011)

(a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, has certified that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest) for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person`s objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) of interest regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest), including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.

PAGE 20 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

(b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the contracting officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (End of Clause)

H. 23 316-1 ACCESSIBILITY OF SOFTWARE (OCTOBER 1999)

PAGE 26 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

The Department of Education (ED) considers universal accessibility to information a priority for all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. Under Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d,as amended), ED must ensure the accessibility of its programs and activities, specifically its obligation to acquire and use accessible electronic and information technology. ED maintains the manual, "Requirements for Accessible Software Design," to convey the accessibility

needs of the Department to the developers and suppliers of computer applications. To comply with the provisions of this

clause, the contractor may use the edition of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design" in effect at the date of award of this contract or any more recent edition. A copy of the most recent edition of the manual may be found at http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/apply/clibrary/software.html (a) Software delivered to or developed for ED--Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this clause, all software delivered to or developed for ED, under this contract, for use by ED's employees or external customers must meet all the requirements of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." However, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may waive a particular requirement of the ED Manual, provided that ED's use of the software will meet the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d, as amended). (b) Software enhanced or modified for ED--Any enhancements and other modifications, made under this contract to software for use by ED's employees or external customers, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause, regardless of where or how the software was first developed. Except as otherwise specified elsewhere in the contract schedule, the contractor is only required to ensure that enhancements or modifications (not other, preexisting features or components) of the software fully comply with the accessibility requirements of paragraph (a). However, the contractor is encouraged point out any preexisting features or components that do not meet accessibility requirements and to suggest solutions to ensure the software complies. (c) Waiver of requirements--It is recognized that new technologies may provide solutions that are not envisioned in or consistent with the provisions of the manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." Also, compliance with certain requirements of the manual may not be feasible for the particular software required. In such extraordinary circumstances, the contracting officer may grant a waiver, in
PAGE 27 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

writing, to any requirement of the manual or of this clause if it furthers a public interest of ED and will not significantly impair ED's ability to ensure accessibility of its programs and activities to all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. To request a waiver, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, listing the specific accessibility requirements that would not be met and explaining how the accessibility of a particular feature can be achieved by alternative means or why it is not feasible to make a feature of the software accessible. (d) Condition of payment--The contractor agrees that compliance with the provisions of this clause upon delivery of the software to ED is a condition of payment under this contract.

(End of Provision) K. 2 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have /_/ have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision. (D) Have /_/, have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

PAGE 38 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has /_/ has not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror`s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

"Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person`s objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (f) Conflict of Interest Certification. The offeror, ____________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. __________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government`s satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

It should be noted that the estimated level of effort in Year 1 that was provided in the ERIC presolicitation conference summary, refer to 0038bPresolicitation_Conference_Summary_for_the_Education_Resources_Information _Center.pdf pg. 18 of 25, shows that, cumulatively, the majority of the estimated level of effort in Year 1 falls under Tasks 3, 4, and 5. As mentioned in the ERIC Presolicitation Conference Summary, the Department expects potential offerors to provide an expected level of effort based on the requirements set forth in the PWS and to use their professional judgment to create a valid and competitive submission. Each offer shall consist of three separate proposals, which shall include a separate binder for each of the following: I. Technical Volume II. Business Volume III. Past Performance Volume

PAGE 58 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

All information necessary to judge the technical soundness and management capabilities of the offeror will be contained in the technical proposal. The cost/business proposal will contain all information related to the determination of the costs associated with each of the project's tasks. The technical proposal shall not contain any reference to specific costs, but resources information (e.g., staff hours) may be included so that the offeror's understanding of the scope of the work may be evaluated. The past performance report shall contain evidence of the offerors past contract performance ratings. An official authorized to bind your organization must sign the proposals. You must submit the technical proposal and past performance volume electronically in WORD AND PDF format and the business proposal as an EXCEL WORKBOOK AND PDF to Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov. In addition, you must submit one original and 3 hard copies of your technical proposal, one original and 3 hard copies of your business proposal, and one original and 3 hard copies of your past performance volumes. The proposals should not be bound and offerors are encouraged to submit proposals in ring binders. Offerors are also encouraged to produce double-sided copies in order to conserve paper and to use recycled paper with a high post-consumer waste content. Proposals are due by 12:30 PM, ET on April 29, 2013, and shall be delivered to: U.S. Department of Education Office of the Chief Financial Officer Contracts and Acquisitions Management 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, LBJ Building, Room BC102 Washington, D.C. 20202-4230 Attn: Jennifer Arthur, Contract Specialist IMPORTANT NOTE: All offerors should be aware that packages sent to the U.S. Department of Education through FEDEX, UPS, U.S. Postal Service, or hand-carried will no longer be accepted by the point of contact in the Contracts and Acquisitions Management office (i.e., Jennifer Arthur, Contract Specialist).

PAGE 59 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

Hand-carried proposals must be delivered by entering through the building and stopping at the Guard's Desk. Offerors should indicate for which solicitation they are submitting a proposal and should have proper identification. Offerors should consider this delay in meeting the time specified for proposal receipt. The proposal shall list the names and telephone numbers of persons authorized to conduct negotiations, and a statement to the effect that your offer is firm for a period of at least 60 calendar days from the date of receipt specified by the Government. The Department will accept clarification questions until April 8, 2012. All clarification questions must be submitted by 2:00 P.M. EDT. After this date, the Department does not guarantee that a response will be provided. All clarification questions will be answered at the same time once the due date has passed and all questions have been received. All questions and answers will be provided to all offerors. Oral explanations or instructions given by the Government before the award of the contract(s) shall not be binding. Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning a solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective offerors if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if a lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective offerors. This information will be sent to all offerors. The following shall serve as the proposal instructions: Volume I: Technical Proposal The offeror must demonstrate corporate and proposed staff experience and expertise in areas applicable to this project. While the intent of each task is spelled out in the PWS, it is up to the offeror to propose the most effective method for carrying out these tasks. The task specifications contained in the Request For Proposal (RFP) are a starting point; the proposal is expected to build on them, providing examples, where appropriate, not simply repeating the language contained in the PWS. Offerors are encouraged to suggest technical improvements to the work. Any proposed changes to the scope of the work or to the deliverable dates shall be justified. It is important that the offeror completely address all the tasks described in the PWS and provide enough detail on the offeror's approach to each task to allow a review panel to adequately judge that approach. The panel will not make assumptions or guesses. Technical proposals shall be no more than 30 double spaced pages in length (front and back), using a 12 point font and 1 inch margins, not including appendices and resumes. All pages, with the exception of resumes, shall be double-spaced and double-sided. All text must be of 12-point font size, at a minimum. All pages

PAGE 64 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

Although the offeror will have already described the relevant qualifications of key staff (prime contractor and any subcontractors or consultants) proposed to implement each task of the PWS, in this section the offeror shall describe the staffing and management plan. Offerors shall explain clearly how they propose to manage and coordinate contract operations and personnel working on the contract, including any subcontractors and consultants. Offerors shall describe how they propose to ensure the completion of the work of the contract on time, within budget, and to the Department standards of acceptable quality. Please refer to Attachment B, Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). Offerors shall describe functional responsibilities, lines of communication and authority for project management, including any sub-contractual arrangements. Offerors shall describe clearly their internal quality control plan that addresses accountability in each task area. In addition to addressing these issues, the offeror shall provide the following: 1. A chart summarizing the roles, lines of authority and responsibility, and reporting structures of key personnel for each task. 2. A table indicating the number of proposed hours of each key staff person by task/subtask and their availability to conduct the proposed work. Offerors shall include the proportion of each key staff person's time that is committed to other projects (including but not limited to federal and nonfederal obligations and outside consulting assignments). In addition, one or more columns shall include the proportion of each person's time included in proposals for other work that includes the period 2013-2018. The contractor will determine all the labor categories and staffing levels appropriate for completing the goals of the project. All contractor staff shall be United States citizens or legal permanent residents. Corporate Experience The offeror shall describe the qualifications and capability of the organization and its experience in conducting projects of similar size, scope, and complexity. A description of qualifications, capability, and experience of the organization are to be included in the proposal. The offeror shall include systematic records of contracts in the appendix. The offeror shall identify three contracts and/or subcontracts completed during the past three years or currently in process. Contracts identified may include those entered into with the federal government, local or state government, or commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should identify contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel. The following information shall be listed for each contract and subcontract and included in the appendix:   Name of Contracting Activity Contract Number

PAGE 65 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

      

Contract Type Total Contract Value Contract Work Contracting Officer and Telephone Number Program Manager and Telephone Number Administrative Contracting Officer and Telephone Number List of Major Subcontractors

The offeror shall provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. Offerors should not provide only general information on their performance on identified contracts. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror produces high-quality services and products. The offeror shall describe the segment of the company, institution, or organization that received the award or certification and when it was bestowed. If the award or certification is more than three years old, the offeror shall present evidence that the qualifications still apply. The Government reserves the right to consider past performance information obtained by other sources. Volume II: Business Proposal Cover Sheet The Department requests that contractors provide the following information on the cover sheet of the business proposal: 1) Solicitation Number ED-IES-13-R-0024 2) The name of offeror and the sub-contractors 3) The percentage of the total proposed budget that will be given to each subcontractor 4) The task/subtask that will be performed by each subcontractor Proposed Prices The proposal shall list the names and telephone numbers of persons authorized to conduct negotiations, and a statement to the effect that your offer is firm for a period of at least 60 calendar days from the date of receipt of offers specified by the Government. The Department anticipates making an award by late summer 2013. The business proposal should include a separate cost estimate for each task (tasks 1 through 9). Business proposals that do not provide separate breakouts for each task are unacceptable.

PAGE 66 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

The business proposal should include detailed cost breakdowns for staff, consultants, subcontractors, travel, supplies, computer costs, etc., for each task (separately). The offeror should provide information on the assumptions underlying estimates of direct costs. The offeror should also provide information on all indirect costs, such as overhead, fee, and G&A, including the categories on which overhead, fees, and G&A will be calculated. Similar business information shall also be submitted for subcontractors.

In addition, offerors are now required to indicate the costs of information technology (IT) utilized to conduct the services required in the PWS. The Department of Education's definition of IT is based on the definition found in the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and OMB Circular A-11. Based on this definition, NCEE requests that offerors separate IT costs of the following nature: (1) usability testing of the website (Task 2.4); (2) adding new fields to the ERIC database (Task 3); (3) adding new non-public fields to the ERIC database; (4) acquire and link to library materials (Task 4); (5) restoring access to ERIC fulltext documents (Task 5); (6) coordinating with vendors (Task 6); and, (7) maintaining ERIC (Task 8). The offeror should make in its breakout of IT costs the activities or products included. IT costs do not have to be broken out by task; rather, IT costs should be indicated as a single line item in the offeror's cost proposal. The offeror may be asked to alter its definition of IT costs if NCEE determines it does not conform to current practice. Listed below are issues that the offeror should consider when preparing its business proposal. Note that all tasks in the PWS must be included in the business proposal although not all are described in detail below.
Task 2. Redesigning the Content of the IES Website

This work involves coordinating with multiple offices and constituencies in order to re-design the content and structure of the IES, the National Center for Education Statistics, and parts of the ERIC websites in a way that is user friendly. The new designs have to be acceptable to multiple stakeholders, including an external working group and an IES working group comprised of members from across the four Centers of IES (i.e., National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), National Center for Education Research or NCER, and National Center for Special Education Research or NCSER). The stakeholder's requirements are unknown at this time and will not become known until the contractor completes a needs assessment in the first year of the contract (Tasks 2.1.2, 2.3.1, and 2.3.2). After the first year of the contract, the contractor will be working on redesigns for the NCES and IES websites and the creation of the education practitioners' page in ERIC. It is anticipated that the contractor's deliverables will undergo multiple layers of review by IES leadership and that there will be several rounds of revisions. At this time, the level of effort required to efficiently carry out the review process is uncertain.

PAGE 67 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

Lastly, the NCES website is considered to be technologically complex. It is expected that the contactor may need to make several revisions to their proposed redesign of the NCES website to (1) meet the needs of relevant stakeholders including the external working group and the IES working group, and (2) ensure the proposed redesign is technologically compatible with the NCES website.

Task 3. Improving the ERIC Database This work involves coordinating with various contractors to determine which data listed under Task 3 has been compiled. This information is necessary to ensure the data needed for inclusion in ERIC is compiled in a non-duplicative manner. The successful offeror for this procurement is expected to coordinate with no more than two contractors. The nature of the work under Task 3 also entails a number of unknown variables. These variables include the type of available data and their accuracy. At present, it is not known how many studies the What Works Clearinghouse will review, how many citations each IES publication will have, or how many grantees will provide articles directly through ERIC.

The offeror shall also provide summary pages showing all contract prices for each deliverable in the period of performance (one 12-month base period and four oneyear options). The offeror shall submit supporting information documenting their price build up by year. The offerors shall submit adequate data to allow complete analysis and evaluation of proposed prices. If necessary, the Department will request other than cost and pricing data to determine that prices are considered fair and reasonable. Offerors shall submit the price for each task and subtask and a total for the 60 month period of performance (i.e. one 12-month base period and four one-year options). The Department's estimated task allocations apply to the full five-year contract period; the Department understands that different tasks may be more or less active (and thus represent a higher or lower fraction of resources) in any given year. In addition to the information requested above, offerors should provide their fullyloaded labor rates for each labor category for the 12-month base period and four one-year options. The full-loaded labor rates should account for escalation throughout the period of performance (i.e. one 12-month base period and four one-year options). Food costs are not allowable; offerors shall not include food in their proposals. Government per diem rules apply for travel costs. ERIC funding cannot be used for invitational travel; therefore, the contractor shall not receive federal reimbursement for travel or food payments to recipients of ERIC services.

PAGE 68 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

Offerors may propose honoraria for the working group that the Department may pay based on the condition that the amount of honoraria proposed is fair and reasonable. However, such arrangements must be approved by the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer Representative. Along with the budget, the offeror shall include a list of each deliverable and a proposed payment amount for that fixed price deliverable, such that the total payment for all deliverables equals the proposed fixed price budget. Offerors shall propose a Pricing and Payment Schedule based on the price of each deliverable, but may propose apportioning the price of some deliverables over time in order to receive payment on a more regular basis. Such apportionment must be accompanied by a valid interim deliverable that demonstrates successful progress towards the completion of the deliverable. The Department will pay the corresponding invoice only after the Department has accepted each fixed price deliverable, including the interim deliverables. As stated in the PWS, offerors may not reimburse travel or meal payments. The page limit of 30 sheets of paper, double-sided (or 60 pages in all) does not apply to the Business Volume. Volume III: Past Performance In accordance with Section L clause 314-1 Past Performance Report, offerors shall submit narrative information about their most recent three contracts in a separate Past Performance Report, completed in the last three years or currently in process but beyond the first year of the contract, which are of similar size, scope, complexity or, in any way, are relevant to the effort required by this solicitation. The three contracts may include those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers. Contracts with the parent or an affiliate of the offeror may not be used. Brief summaries of such work should be submitted, including the names, current affiliations, and current telephone numbers of the project directors. All similar federal contracts should be included. Overlap between these and the references provided for key project personnel is acceptable. The offeror shall provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. Offerors should not provide only general information on their performance on identified contracts. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror produces high-quality services and products. The offeror shall describe the segment of the company, institution, or organization that received the award or certification and when it was bestowed. If the award or certification is more than three years old, the offeror shall present evidence that the qualifications still apply.

PAGE 69 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

Past Performance References In addition to the abovementioned Past Performance information included in the Past Performance Volume, the "Past Performance Information" form (Attachment C) should be used to solicit this information from three (3) references that will submit the information directly to the Government. Consideration of the offeror's reputation in terms of quality, problem resolution, cost control, timeliness, business relations and customer service will be evaluated. Each reference is to complete the form and return it to the Contract Specialist, Jennifer Arthur, as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due on the same day as Technical Proposals, Business Proposals, and Past Performance Volume under this solicitation. Request that the reference please provide the completed form to the Contract Specialist by the due date, to the following email address: Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov. Please make sure that they reference: RFP ED-IES-13-R-0024. The Government reserves the right to contact past performance references to verify the information provided. The Government also reserves the right to obtain past performance information from other sources. The offeror shall not include cost information in the past performance volume, but shall include this information in the business proposal, which shall be a separate volume prepared according to the instructions set forth in Section L of this solicitation. The page limit of 30 sheets of paper, double-sided (or 60 pages in all) does not apply to the Past Performance section.

SECTION M: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

BASIS OF AWARD The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, has no deficiencies (as defined in FAR 15.001) and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered. For this solicitation, price will be a substantial factor in source selection, however quality factors (including technical merit and past performance), considered together, are significantly more important than price. The Contracting Officer will determine whether the difference in quality is worth the difference in cost or price.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD In accordance with FAR 15.305, the U.S. Department of Education will determine technical merit ratings for individual proposals using an adjectival ratings scale. In evaluation of the technical proposal the Department will consider the following subfactors which are in descending order of importance. TECHNICAL 1.

5. Corporate expertise, capability, and oversight ("Exceptional", "Acceptable", "Marginal", or "Unacceptable"):  Demonstrated experience with projects of a similar scale and scope  Provided evidence of strong corporate commitment to managerial oversight as evidenced by, for example, a clear and effective approach to problem identification and resolution, or a clear corporate hierarchy for project oversight PAST PERFORMANCE Past performance will be rated as a separate factor during the technical evaluation. The following evaluation factors will be considered in evaluating past performance: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Quality of Product of Service Problem Resolution Cost Control Timeliness of Performance Business Relations 6. Customer Service The Department's evaluation team will consider three sources of information in evaluating an offeror's past performance. First, the evaluation team will consider information reported in the offeror's Past Performance Volume. Second, the evaluation team will consider past performance evaluations submitted on behalf of the offeror. And, third, the evaluation team will consider past performance information other than past performance references that are submitted on an offeror's behalf. Such information includes news releases, other past performance evaluations, personal experiences, and interviews for technical review and evaluation. If needed, and in accordance with FAR 15.306, the Contracting Officer will allow offerors to address adverse past performance if the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to comment. The Government reserves the right to obtain past performance information from sources other than what is reported by the offeror in their Past Performance Volume, and past performance references that are submitted on an offeror's behalf. BUSINESS REVIEW Business proposals will be evaluated for cost reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404. Cost will not be adjectival scored but will be taken into account in the selection in accordance with the RFP. Additionally, the offeror's responsibility will be ascertained in accordance with FAR 9.1041.

PAGE 74 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

The below adjectival rating scheme will be used in evaluation of each technical evaluation factor: Rating Scheme: For subfactors that will be rated, evaluators will apply the following adjectival ratings: DEFINITION Exceeds specified performance or capability in a beneficial way to the agency and Exceptional has a high probability of satisfying the requirement; has no significant weaknesses. Meets evaluation standards; has good probability of satisfying the requirement; Acceptable any weaknesses can be readily corrected. Fails to meet evaluation standards; has low probability of satisfying the Marginal requirement; has significant deficiencies. Fails to meet minimum requirement; deficiency requires a major revision to the Unacceptable proposal to make it correct. The below adjectival rating scheme will be used in evaluation of past performance: ADJECTIVAL RATING Excellent DEFINITIONS Consistent record of exceptional past performance, by the offeror and any proposed major subcontractors, on work identical to or very similar to the work elements presented in this procurement. Many strengths and no weaknesses. Consistent record of successful past performance, by the offeror and any proposed major subcontractors, on work identical to or very similar to the work elements presented in this procurement. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Successful past performance, by the offeror and any proposed major subcontractors, on work similar to the work elements presented in this procurement. Strengths outweigh any weaknesses. Assigned to an offeror with no relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available. RATING

Very Good

Good

Neutral

Fair

Weaknesses outweigh strengths.

Poor

Weaknesses far outweigh strengths.

PAGE 75 OF 76 ED-IES-13-R-0024

Definitions The following definitions shall be considered when evaluating the proposed solution: STRENGTH: An attribute in the proposal, which can be beneficial to the program or greatly increase the probability of successful contract performance. WEAKNESS: An attribute in the proposal that is a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS: An attribute in the proposal that is a flaw and appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. DEFICIENCY: A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement, or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal, that increase the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. HIGH RISK: Risk that is considered to be likely to cause significant, serious disruption in schedule, increase in cost, or degradation in performance; even with special attention from the contractor and close Government monitoring. MODERATE RISK: Risk that may cause some disruption in schedule, increase in cost, or degradation in performance, but special attention from the contractor and close Government monitoring could possibly overcome the difficulties. LOW RISK: Risk that has little potential for causing disruption in schedule, increase in cost, or degradation performance; normal effort from the contractor and normal Government monitoring can probably overcome any difficulties.
