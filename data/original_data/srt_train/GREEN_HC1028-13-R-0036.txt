2.  Contract Title.  Enterprise Services Attack Analysis

3.  Background.   Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)  and the National Security Agency (NSA)  were tasked to develop an Information
Assurance (IA) Audit Management System that has the capability of enterprise service for logging, collecting data, and analysis of data for
Enterprise Services (eg: DoD Enterprise Email, Enterprise Share Point, Enterprise Cross Domain) IA devices and systems.  It will also have the
capability to detect malicious threats from insiders.  The technical challenge is to develop the data management architecture and manipulation
tools including the use of ‘Big Data’ cloud storage and analysis technologies that will enable automated identification of critically anomalous
events that indicate both internal and external malicious activity.  The objective of the IA Audit Management System is to provide the
capability to defend against insider threat as well as external threats to the DoD thus, vastly improving DoD’s auditing processes and Defense-
in-Depth strategy. In addition, the system will also provide a large payoff for the war fighter by increasing the security of continuously-
monitored systems, availability of mission information, and reduction in the time and resources required to perform repetitive and time-
intensive manual reviews of audit logs that are often fruitless.

4.  Objectives:  Develop and support the implementation of analytical methods to the Government to support DOD Computer Network Defense (CND)
analytics performed at the operational level (CYBERCOM, NSA, Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), Services, and other agencies).

5.  Scope.  Work performed by the contractor under this contract will support the Enterprise Attack Analysis effort that is focused on DOD
enterprise service logs including enterprise service gateway logs.  The contractor will also provide implementation/development support for log
scripting to define such vulnerabilities as malware and attack vectoring, create analytical methods to counter the threat of malware and network
vulnerabilities using web/firewall/other hardware log analysis, and provide training on log analysis by using scripting techniques to the DOD
CND community.  This is not exclusively a software development effort.  The purpose of this effort is not primarily to develop deployable
Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) software packages to the CND community, but to develop/enhance scripts (similar to macros) that will reside on
Government servers at centralized locations that will pull from existing Government databases and various log files, to perform analysis of
architecture to determine threats and proposed data collection and aggregation, and work with CND analysts to improve detection of attacks
against the DoD Global Information Grid.

12.  Security.

   12.1 Security Clearances
   The security classification level expected for work performed under this PWS is up to TOP SECRET/SCI.  Contractor personnel must be U.S.
   citizens and have an active DOD SECRET or TOP SECRET clearance and if requiring access to SCI information must: be U.S. citizens, have been
   granted a final DCID 6/4 security clearance by the U.S. Government, and have been indoctrinated for the applicable compartments of SCI access
   prior to being given any access to such information released or generated under this contract.  DOD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program,
   requires DoD military and civilian personnel, as well as DoD consultant and Contractor personnel, who perform on sensitive automated
   information systems (ISs), be assigned to positions which are designated as one of two sensitivity levels (IT-1, IT-II):


   Critical-Sensitive Positions (IT-I positions): Those positions in which the incumbent is responsible for the planning, direction, and
   implementation of computer security program~ major responsibility for the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the
   hardware and software; or, can access a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, and with a relatively high risk for causing
   grave damage, or realize a significant personal gain. IT -I designated positions require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).


   Non-critical-Sensitive Positions (IT-II positions): Those positions in which the incumbent is responsible for the direction, planning, design,
   operation, or maintenance of a computer system, and whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority of the IT-I category to ensure
   the integrity of the system. IT-II designated positions require a DoD National Agency Check Plus Written Inquiries (DNACI) National Agency
   Check Plus Written Inquiries (NACI).


   All personnel working on this task will be an IT-I or IT-II positions. The required investigation will be completed prior to the assignment of
   individuals to sensitive duties associated with the position. The Contractor will forward their employee clearance information to:


   ATTN: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
   Programs and Oversight Branch, MP61
   P.O. Box 549
   Fort Meade, MD 20775


   DISA retains the right to request removal of Contractor personnel, regardless of prior clearance or adjudication status, whose actions, while
   assigned to this contract, clearly conflict with the interests of the Government.  The reason for removal will be fully documented in writing
   by the Contracting Officer.  When and if such removal occurs, the Contractor will, within 5 working days, assign qualified personnel to any
   vacancy created.  See Appendix B for more details.


   12.2 IT- Position Category
      12.2.1 IT-I Position
      Incumbent of this position has privileged access to networks and information systems, system security and network defense systems, or to
      system resources. Duties are broad in scope and authority and provide access to the U.S. Government, DoD, or Component mission critical
      systems. The potential exists for exceptionally serious adverse impact on U.S. Government, DoD, Component or private sector information
      and/or operations, with worldwide or government-wide effects.
      12.2.2 IT-II Position
      Incumbents of this position has limited privileged access, but duties are of considerable importance to the DoD or DoD Component mission,
      and the incumbent is under the supervision of an individual in a higher trust position (IT-I).  For example, individuals in these positions
      may have ability to impact a limited set of explicitly defined privileged functions, such as privileged access confined to large portions
      of an IT or to a local network physically isolated from other DoD or publicly accessible networks.  The potential exists for moderate to
      serious adverse impact on DoD or Component information or operations.


   12.3 DoD 8570.01-M Requirements (DFARS Clause 252.239-7001)
   Per Section C2.1.4 of DoD 8570.01-M, a condition of privileged access to any information system is that personnel performing IA functions must
   satisfy both preparatory and sustaining DoD IA training and certification requirements. In accordance with DFARS 252.239-7001, "Information
   Assurance Contractor Training and Certification," the following positions are categorized per DoD 8570.01-M as follows: PWS Section 6.2.2
   through 6.2.5  requires the support of IAT Level II; and PWS Section 6.2.1  requires the support of IASAE Level II.
   In addition to the DoD requirements for 8570-related training, DISA has agency-specific requirements for 8570 training. Contractor personnel
   shall complete 8-16 hours of DISA-specific training, which will be provided by the Government after contract award. The particular training
   course and its associated number of hours of training required will be determined by the job duties of the personnel identified.
   The Contractor shall provide documentation supporting the information assurance certification status of personnel performing information
   assurance functions at the Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM). If personnel performing information assurance functions are hired after the
   TIM, the Contractor shall provide documentation supporting the information assurance certification status of such personnel immediately upon
   hire. No personnel will be allowed to perform information assurance functions without possessing the required information assurance
   certification.
   The Contractor shall report on their DoD 8570.01-M certification status in the MSRs (see PWS Sections 6.1.2 and 11, Item Number 4). The
   initial MSR shall indicate that all information assurance personnel have the required certification. Future MSRs shall provide status updates
   for newly hired information assurance personnel
         Deliverable:  (27) Information Assurance Certification for all personnel performing information
         assurance functions (due at TIM and immediately upon hire of any information
         assurance personnel hired after TIM).

13.  Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government-Furnished Information (GFI).
Upon identification by the Government COR of a requirement for DISN access (both SIPRNet and NIPRNet), the Government will provide such access
in a Government facility when required.  Specifically, the Government will provide access (at a Government location) to the ADP, computer and
support equipment necessary for the contractor to access and perform work on the DISN, including computer hardware and software, from the time
that the DISN access requirement is identified through the period of performance.  GFE and Government Owned Equipment should be used for this
Performance Work Statement (PWS) under this delivery order with following exceptions for which the contractor will be responsible for:

      1. Personal Computers (both desktops and laptops) that may be needed to perform TO related tasks outside of the Government locations.
      2. Personal telecommunication systems (both voice and data) that may be needed to perform TO related tasks outside of the Government
           locations.

14.  Other Pertinent Information or Special Considerations.

a. Identification of Possible Follow-on Work & Possible Growth.  Possible follow-on work includes additional development to meet future
   requirements. Dependent on changing requirements and available funding, each year, the government may require a significant increase in the
   level of effort provided by this contract.  The government may provide up to 15% increase in the ceiling/funding to receive the increased
   level of service. This funding will likely be provided incrementally throughout the year.
b. Removal of Contract Personnel. The government retains the right to request removal contractor personnel, regardless of prior clearance or
   adjudication status, whose actions, while assigned to this contract, clearly conflict with the interests of the Government.  The reason for
   removal will be fully documented in writing by the Contracting officer.  When and if such removal occurs, the contractor will, within three
   (3) working days assign qualified personnel to any vacancy thus created.
c. Identification of Non-Disclosure Requirements. All Intellectual property for this effort will be owned by the Government.  At Government
   sites, Contractor shall have access to systems and data related to IA Audit Management.  The data may be classified and will be handled
   according to classification levels of the system in which it resides.
d. Identification of Possible Significant Growth. Dependent on changing requirements and available funding, each year, the government may
   require a significant increase in the level of effort provided by this contract. The government may provide up to 15% increase in the
   ceiling/funding to receive the increased level of service. This funding will likely be provided incrementally throughout the year.
e. Packaging, Packing, and Shipping Instructions.  Packaging, packing and shipping will be in accordance with DITCO/DISA standards.

   deliverables shall be grammatically correct and technically accurate.  Final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables shall be performed
   at the place of delivery.  The Government requires a period not to exceed 30 days after receipt of the final deliverable items for inspection
   and acceptance or rejection, unless otherwise specified.  All deliverables must be submitted directly to the TM or his/her designated
   representative.  The TM will monitor the Contractor efforts to ensure technical suitability.
   If the deliverable does not meet the specified criteria, it will be returned.  After notification that the deliverable did not meet the
   acceptance criteria, the Contractor shall re-submit the deliverable within 14 days.  Upon re-submission by the Contractor, the Government will
   apply the same acceptance criteria.  If the deliverable does not meet the acceptance criteria a second time, the Government may consider the
   Contractor as having deficient performance with respect to the subject task.  The Contractor shall permit the KO or designated representative
   access at any reasonable time to all records, data, and facilities used in the performance of services.
g. Enhanced Skills Training.  In the event the Contractor would like to attend training that would provide benefit to the work being performed
   under this contract, the Contractor may request the COR to approve attendance on a case-by-case basis.  In the event the COR approves, the
   Contractor will be responsible for paying all tuition, per diem and travel costs, but may bill the labor hours to attend to this contract.
h. Certification and Accreditation. The Contractor’s solution(s) will be certified and accredited via the DIACAP process as applicable. The
   appointed Designated Approving Authority (DAA) will ensure all vulnerabilities on the product are fixed or risk mitigation is performed before
   granting the Authority to Operate (ATO) approval. The product must receive an ATO before it is placed on any DoD network. This process is the
   government's method of ensuring STIG compliance of the proposed solution(s).

QASP, 3 APR 13


                                                    QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)




1.  Contract or Task Order Title: Enterprise Attack Analysis

2.  Work Requirements:

    • Task 1 -  Task 1 - Enterprise Management Controls
    • Task 2 - Development and Implementation of the Audit Log Management Program


3.  Primary Method of Surveillance:
Periodic and Routine Inspection: Periodic inspections may occur on a pre-determined basis (e.g. daily, weekly, and/or monthly) as determined by
the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). The results of periodic inspections may be used as the basis for subpar report documentation.
Periodic inspections automatically become 100 percent evaluations or “100 % checks”. Random inspections may also be used and can occur at any
time and location.

4.  Scope of Performance:  Work performed by the contractor under this contract will support the Enterprise Attack Analysis effort that is
focused on DOD enterprise service logs including enterprise service gateway logs.  The contractor will also provide implementation/ development
support for log scripting to define such vulnerabilities as malware and attack vectoring, create analytical methods to counter the threat of
malware and network vulnerabilities using web/firewall/other hardware log analysis, and provide training on log analysis by using scripting
techniques to the DOD Computer Network Defense (CND) community. This is not exclusively a software development effort. The purpose of this
effort is not primarily to develop deployable Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) software packages to the CND community, but to develop/enhance
scripts (similar to macros) that will reside on Government servers at centralized locations that will pull from existing Government databases
and various log files.

When the performance threshold for a particular PWS task is not met and re-performance does not correct the problem, the contractor shall
explain, within 14 days in writing to Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) or Alternate Contracting Officer’s Representative (ACOR) why
performance was unacceptable, how performance will be returned to acceptable levels, and how recurrence of the problem will be prevented in the
future.  The COR/ACOR will evaluate the contractor's explanation and determine what corrective action should be taken to rectify the deficiency.
 At the government’s discretion, payment may be withheld until the associated support and documentation is satisfactorily provided.

When re-performance does not correct the deficiency and the contractor’s explanation of degraded performance is not deemed acceptable the
COR/ACOR will notify the contracting officer for appropriate recourse, at the governments discretion, payment and or a percentage of the payment
may be withheld.

6.  Acceptable Quality Level (AQL):
The AQL is noted above in the performance standards table

7.  Evaluation Method:

    • The Program Manager (PM) and Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) will periodically review the schedule to ensure it continues to
      accurately identify major milestones, decision points, lifecycle, dependencies, other events for the program.  The COR will confirm the
      contractor is prepared to modify the schedule format and/or provide additional information based on management/technical requirements.  The
      COR will confirm the date and time of updated schedules for the record.
    •  The PM and COR will document when each deliverable is provided and document if delivery is within established timeframes.  The COR/ACOR
      shall provide both a verbal and written notification to the contractor of any deliverables that do not meet the AQL.
    • The PM and COR will review and monitor the contractor’s weekly activities by reviewing all reports, briefings and minutes submitted by the
      contractor about the quality, the completeness of its contents and required format changes and document deliverables not within the
      specified performance thresholds.
    • The COR/ACOR shall notify the DITCO Contracting Officer of performance that does not meet the AQL.

8.  Incentives (Positive and/or Negative):
  For both outstanding and negative performances, ratings shall be recorded in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.209-9000  ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (OCCI)  (DEC 2005)

(a)  An offeror shall identify in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, any potential or actual Organizational and Consultant
Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) as described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  This includes actual or potential conflicts of interests of proposed
subcontractors.  If an offeror identifies in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, a potential or actual conflict of interests the
offeror shall submit an Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest Plan (OCCIP) to the contracting officer.  The OCCIP shall describe
how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future
conflicts of interest.

(b)  Offerors must consider whether their involvement and participation raises any OCCI issues, especially in the following areas when:

     (1)  Providing systems engineering and technical direction.

     (2)  Preparing specifications or work statements and/or objectives.

     (3)  Providing evaluation services.

     (4)  Obtaining access to proprietary information.

(c)  If a prime contractor or subcontractor breaches any of the OCCI restrictions, or does not disclose or misrepresents any relevant facts
concerning its conflict of interest, the government may take appropriate action, including terminating the contract, in additional to any
remedies that may be otherwise permitted by the contract or operation of law.

                                                                 (End of clause)




52.217-9     OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)

(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 10 days of contract expiration; provided that
the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days  before the contract expires. The
preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.

(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 54.
(End of clause)



52.219-28    POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2012)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that
exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the
clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of
operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling
or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In
determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of
employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements,
facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the
novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

(2) Records of Government property shall be readily available to authorized Government personnel and shall be appropriately safeguarded.

(3) Should it be determined by the Government that the Contractor’s (or subcontractor’s) property management practices are inadequate or not

until authorized to do so by the Plant Clearance Officer or authorizing official.

(1) Predisposal requirements.

(i) If the Contractor determines that the property has the potential to fulfill requirements under other contracts, the Contractor, in
consultation with the Property Administrator, shall request that the Contracting Officer transfer the property to the contract in question, or
provide authorization for use, as appropriate. In lieu of transferring the property, the Contracting Officer may authorize the Contractor to
credit the costs of Contractor-acquired property (material only) to the losing contract, and debit the gaining contract with the corresponding
cost, when such material is needed for use on another contract. Property no longer needed shall be considered contractor inventory.

(ii) For any remaining Contractor-acquired property, the Contractor may purchase the property at the unit acquisition cost if desired or make
reasonable efforts to return unused property to the appropriate supplier at fair market value (less, if applicable, a reasonable restocking fee
that is consistent with the supplier’s customary practices.)

(2) Inventory disposal schedules.

(i) Absent separate contract terms and conditions for property disposition, and provided the property was not reutilized, transferred, or
otherwise disposed of, the Contractor, as directed by the Plant Clearance Officer or authorizing official, shall use Standard Form 1428,
Inventory Disposal Schedule or electronic equivalent, to identify and report—

(A) Government-furnished property that is no longer required for performance of this contract;

(B) Contractor-acquired property, to which the Government has obtained title under paragraph (e) of this clause, which is no longer required for
performance of that contract; and

(C) Termination inventory.

(ii) The Contractor may annotate inventory disposal schedules to identify property the Contractor wishes to purchase from the Government, in the
event that the property is offered for sale.

(iii) Separate inventory disposal schedules are required for aircraft in any condition, flight safety critical aircraft parts, and other items
as directed by the Plant Clearance Officer.

(iv) The Contractor shall provide the information required by FAR 52.245-1(f)(1)(iii) along with the following:

(A) Any additional information that may facilitate understanding of the property’s intended use.

(B) For work-in-progress, the estimated percentage of completion.

(C) For precious metals in raw or bulk form, the type of metal and estimated weight.

(thickness, width and length).

(v) Property with the same description, condition code, and reporting location may be grouped in a single line item.

(vi) Scrap should be reported by “lot” along with metal content, estimated weight and estimated value.

(3) Submission requirements.

(i) The Contractor shall submit inventory disposal schedules to the Plant Clearance Officer no later than—

(A) 30 days following the Contractor’s determination that a property item is no longer required for performance of this contract;

(B) 60 days, or such longer period as may be approved by the Plant Clearance Officer, following completion of contract deliveries or
performance; or

(C) 120 days, or such longer period as may be approved by the Termination Contracting Officer, following contract termination in whole or in
part.

(ii) Unless the Plant Clearance Officer determines otherwise, the Contractor need not identify or report production scrap on inventory disposal
schedules, and may process and dispose of production scrap in accordance with its own internal scrap procedures. The processing and disposal of
other types of Government-owned scrap will be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract or Plant Clearance Officer
direction, as appropriate.

(4) Corrections. The Plant Clearance Officer may—

(i) Reject a schedule for cause (e.g., contains errors, determined to be inaccurate); and

(ii) Require the Contractor to correct an inventory disposal schedule.

(5) Postsubmission adjustments. The Contractor shall notify the Plant Clearance Officer at least 10 working days in advance of its intent to
remove an item from an approved inventory disposal schedule. Upon approval of the Plant Clearance Officer, or upon expiration of the notice
period, the Contractor may make the necessary adjustments to the inventory schedule.

(6) Storage.

(i) The Contractor shall store the property identified on an inventory disposal schedule pending receipt of disposal instructions. The
Government’s failure to furnish disposal instructions within 120 days following acceptance of an inventory disposal schedule may entitle the
Contractor to an equitable adjustment for costs incurred to store such property on or after the 121st day.

(ii) The Contractor shall obtain the Plant Clearance Officer’s approval to remove property from the premises where the property is currently
located prior to receipt of final disposition instructions. If approval is granted, any costs incurred by the Contractor to transport or store
the property shall not increase the price or fee of any Government contract. The storage area shall be appropriate for assuring the property’s
physical safety and suitability for use. Approval does not relieve the Contractor of any liability for such property under this contract.

(7) Disposition instructions.

(i) The Contractor shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of Contractor inventory as directed by the Plant Clearance
Officer. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer or by the Plant Clearance Officer, the Contractor shall remove and destroy any
markings identifying the property as U.S. Government-owned property prior to its disposal.

(ii) The Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to demilitarize the property prior to shipment or disposal. In such cases, the
Contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment under paragraph (i) of this clause.

(8) Disposal proceeds. As directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall credit the net proceeds from the disposal of Contractor
inventory to the contract, or to the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.

(9) Subcontractor inventory disposal schedules. The Contractor shall require its Subcontractors to submit inventory disposal schedules to the
Contractor in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (j)(3) of this clause.

(k) Abandonment of Government property.

(1) The Government shall not abandon sensitive property or termination inventory without the Contractor’s written consent.

(2) The Government, upon notice to the Contractor, may abandon any nonsensitive property in place, at which time all obligations of the
Government regarding such property shall cease.

(3) Absent contract terms and conditions to the contrary, the Government may abandon parts removed and replaced from property as a result of
normal maintenance actions, or removed from property as a result of the repair, maintenance, overhaul, or modification process.

(4) The Government has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Contractor’s premises under any circumstances; however, if Government-
furnished property is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the intended use, or if other Government property is substituted, then the equitable
adjustment under paragraph (i) of this clause may properly include restoration or rehabilitation costs.

(l) Communication. All communications under this clause shall be in writing.

(m) Contracts outside the United States. If this contract is to be performed outside of the United States and its outlying areas, the words
“Government” and “Government-furnished” (wherever they appear in this clause) shall be construed as “United States Government” and “United
States Government-furnished,” respectively.

(2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the CCR database; and

(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal

prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing
agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed

consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from
the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the
Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in
the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this
contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)
(1)
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or
has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-
name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written
notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C)
agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that

assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the

other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov
or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.204-3 TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION (OCT 1998)

(a) Definitions.

Common parent, as used in this provision, means that corporate entity that owns or controls an affiliated group of corporations that files its
Federal income tax returns on a consolidated basis, and of which the offeror is a member.

Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), as used in this provision, means the number required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be used by
the offeror in reporting income tax and other returns. The TIN may be either a Social Security Number or an Employer Identification Number.

(b) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this provision to comply with debt collection
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued
by the IRS. If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.904,
the failure or refusal by the offeror to furnish the information may result in a 31 percent reduction of payments otherwise due under the
contract.

52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have      , have not      , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)



52.215-6      PLACE OF PERFORMANCE (OCT 1997)

applicable block) to use one or more plants or facilities located at a different address from the address of the offeror or respondent as
indicated in this proposal or response to request for information.

Section L - Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Bidders

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

SECTION L

                                         Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors or Respondents

                                        INFORMATION TO OFFERORS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION

1.       General Instructions.

      (a)         This section of the Information to Offerors provides general guidance for preparing proposals as well as specific instructions
on the format and content of the proposal. The offeror's proposal must include all data and information requested by the RFP and must be
submitted in accordance with these instructions.  Non-conformance with the instructions provided in this Information to Offerors may result in
an unfavorable proposal evaluation.

      (b)         The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the
validity of stated claims.  The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide
convincing rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet these requirements.  Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior
knowledge of their facilities and experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offeror's proposal.

      (c)         In accordance with FAR Subpart 4.8 (Government Contract Files), the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful
proposals.

2.       Page Limitations/Format.  The Technical/Management portion of the quotation must be limited to 13 pages (Technical – 10, Management –
3), not including key personnel resumes or OCI Mitigation Plan.  Past performance information shall be no more than 2 pages long per effort.
Page limitations shall be treated as maximums.  If exceeded, the excess pages will not be read or considered in the evaluation of the proposal.
Page limitations may also be placed on responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs).  The specified page limits for EN responses will be identified in
the letters forwarding the ENs to the offerors.  Each page shall be counted except the following:  cover pages, table of contents, tabs,
glossaries, resumes, OCI mitigation plan, DD 254, cost/price proposal, contractor informaton sheet.  Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches (not
including cost spreadsheets).  Text size shall be no less than 10 point.  Use at least 1 inch margins on the top and bottom and ¾-inch side
margins.  These page format restrictions shall apply to responses to ENs.

3.       Proposal Submittal Requirements:

         (a)     Narrative Summary.  The offeror shall provide a 1-page summary that describes the format and content of the proposal.

      (b)         Volume I – Technical/Management.

                 (1)      General.  Your responses will be evaluated against the technical/ management factors/subfactors defined in Section M,
Evaluation Factors for Award.  Using the instructions provided below, provide as specifically as possible the actual methodology you would use
for accomplishing/satisfying these subfactors.  All the requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory.  By your proposal submission,
you are representing that your firm will perform all the requirements specified in the solicitation.  It is not necessary or desirable for you
to tell us so in your proposal.  Do not merely reiterate the objectives or reformulate the requirements specified in the solicitation.

                 (2)      Format and Specific Content.  The technical/management portion of the proposal should include all information the
offeror wants the Government to consider and evaluate regarding its company’s ability to perform all required tasks and conform to all required
terms and conditions.  The proposal should address all aspects of the PWS, making special note of the evaluation factors below.  In particular,
the proposal should address the basic capability and related enabling elements outlined in the PWS.  Include in the Technical/Management volume
an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plan and Key Resumes.  The OCI Mitigation Plan and Key Resumes do not count toward the
page count.

           (3)   Identification of Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs).  As part of its proposal, the Contractor will identify
any potential conflicts of interest and provide documentation as to their remediation strategy.

                          a.      Due to the nature of the DoD IA Program, OCI issues are a significant concern as they hold the potential to
disrupt the performance of this contract and other contracts awarded and administered by DISA. As such, OCI will also be evaluated as part of
the management practices sub factor for proposal risk in terms of your company’s approach to identifying and mitigating potential OCIs for both
you and any teammates. This is the case whether an OCI mitigation plan is required or not, and is a consideration above and beyond the
acceptability of the OCI mitigation approach IAW FAR Subpart 9.5.

                          b.      DISA would like to remind companies deciding to pursue proposing on this effort in any prime, subcontractor,
or teaming arrangement capacity of their responsibility to ensure they address, and take steps to avoid and/or mitigate, any potential OCI
issues. This is especially important for companies supporting Government entities that will be involved in providing support activities for this
effort. Guidance is found in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 9. Such companies should examine any support contracts it has in
place with the Government for provisions addressing OCI issues. A company finding it has a potential OCI situation must submit and have approved
a mitigation plan prior to the Government’s consideration of any proposal for award. Since the approval process can be lengthy and approval of
any plan is not assured, it is highly recommended that potential OCI identification and resolution processes begin as soon in this pre-award
phase as possible. An OCI may result in the canceling of an order or determining an offeror ineligible for award.

                          c.      OCI Policies and Programs: Each plan should describe any OCI policies or programs currently in effect or
planned for each offeror team member as appropriate, such as:

                • In-house OCI Training for new and existing employees
                • OCI Certification Statements
                • OCI Enforcement Policies
                • Employee OCI reporting requirements
                • Consequences for OCI violations
                • Disclosure of violations to the Government
                • OCI policies related to employee transfer; separation; and compensation
                • Use Nondisclosure Agreements / Transfer of Information Agreements (include models drafts where appropriate)

                 (4)      Resumes for Key Personnel:  As part of its proposal, the Contractor shall provide two-page resumes of key personnel
projected for assignment to the task.  The Program Manager and Lead Subject Matter Expert (SME) are identified as key personnel for the program.
 Below is a basic listing of those requirements which the contractor must adequately address in its proposal.  This is to ensure that the
contractor has the requisite skills to effectively and successfully meet the PWS requirements.  Acronyms: Information Assurance (IA); Commercial
Off the Shelf (COTS); Internet Protocol (IP); Computer Network Defense (CND).

52.215-20      REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR INFORMATION OTHER THAN CERTIFIED COST OR PRICING DATA (OCT 2010)

(a) Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data. (1) In lieu of submitting certified cost or pricing data, offerors may submit a written
request for exception by submitting the information described in the following subparagraphs. The Contracting Officer may require additional
supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether an exception should be granted, and whether the price is fair and
reasonable.

(i) Identification of the law or regulation establishing the price offered. If the price is controlled under law by periodic rulings, reviews,
or similar actions of a governmental body, attach a copy of the controlling document, unless it was previously submitted to the contracting
office.

(ii) Commercial item exception. For a commercial item exception, the offeror shall submit, at a minimum, information on prices at which the same
item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for
this  acquisition. Such information may include--

(A) For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items, or a statement
that the catalog is on file in the buying office to which the proposal is being submitted. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies
and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each
offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in
quantities similar to the proposed quantities;

(B) For market-priced items, the source and date or period of the market quotation or other basis for market price, the base amount, and
applicable discounts. In addition, describe the nature of the market;

(C) For items included on an active Federal Supply Service Multiple Award Schedule contract, proof that an exception has been granted for the
schedule item.

(2) The offeror grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before award, books, records,
documents, or other directly pertinent records to verify any request for an exception under this provision, and the reasonableness of price. For
items priced using catalog or market prices, or law or  regulation , access does not extend to cost or profit information or other data relevant
solely to the offeror's determination of the prices to be offered in the catalog or marketplace.

(b) Requirements for certified cost or pricing data. If the offeror is not granted an exception from the requirement to submit certified cost or
pricing data, the following applies:

(1) The offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data, data other than certified cost or pricing data, and supporting
attachments in accordance with the instructions contained in Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408, which is incorporated by reference with the same force
and effect as though it were inserted here in full text. The instructions in Table 15-2 are incorporated as a mandatory format to be used in
this contract, unless the Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree to a different format and change this clause to use Alternate I.

As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before contract award (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts), the offeror
shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
SECTION M

                                                           Evaluation Factors for Award

                                                                 SOURCE SELECTION


1.       BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD.

         (a)     Award will be made to the contractor whose proppsal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government using a
best value tradeoff evaluation process.  Proposals will be evaluated with regard to how they respond to the requirements of the PWS, on records
of past performance, and on cost/price submissions.  This is a best value award, and Section 508 Accessibility Standards do apply to this
requirement.  Section 508 requirements are listed in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Compliance with Section 508 standards will
be considered prior to evaluating any of the selection criteria listed below.  Any proposal failing to meet the Section 508 Accessibility
Standards, as listed in the PWS, may be eliminated from consideration for award.

         (b)     The standards for evaluating the factors are contained in the Evaluation Tables.  Proposals which are rated “Red/Unacceptable”
in any area may be excluded from further consideration.

         (c)     The Government will use the following evaluation factors to determine a contractor’s relative ability to accomplish the tasks
set forth in the PWS.  The Government reserves the right not to consider for award any quotation that does not adhere to the administrative
requirements of this Request for Proposal.

2.       EVALUATION FACTORS.

         (a)     Technical/Management Approach:  Technical/Management Factor is equal to the Past Performance Factor.

                 (1)      Technical Approach:  (Maximum # Pages Allowed: 10) The Contractor shall demonstrate a complete understanding of all
technical requirements outlined in the performance work statement, and demonstrate a plan to fully meet or exceed the following tasks from the
PWS:

                          (a)     SubFactor 1: Enterprise Management Controls (PWS paragraph 6.1 and all subtasks)

                          (b)     SubFactor 2: Development and Implementation of the Audit Log Management Program (PWS paragraph 6.2 and all
subtasks)

                 (2)  Management Approach:  (Maximum # of Pages Allowed: 3) The contractor shall demonstrate a comprehensive management approach
that ensures fully-trained, top-quality personnel are provided to meet all requirements of the performance work statement.  The contractor's
management approach shall address how the contractor will track and manage all resources to support the efforts outlined in the performance work
statement.  The contractor's proposal shall provide the optimum mix of labor categories, labor hours, and other direct costs to meet the
requirements of the performance work statement.

         (b)     Past Performance:  Past Performance is Equal to the Technical/Management Factor

                 (1)      Recency Assessment:  Recent contracts are defined as those contracts which are being performed currently or have been
performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition
will not be evaluated.

                 (2)      Relevancy Assessment:  If the Government evaluators consider the offeror’s past performance reference to be recent,
then the Government will assess the relevancy of the referenced past performance task order/contract.  The Government determines relevancy by
evaluating the past performance references against the technical factor/subfactors contained in the solicitation.  The past performance factor
does not contain subfactors.  The past performance questionnaires (if used) and information obtained from other sources will be used to
establish the degree of relevancy and quality of past performance.  Past Performance relevancy definitions are located in Table 2, Page 3.  A
past performance citation that is assessed as Not Relevant will not be evaluated further.

         (c)     Cost/Price Factor:  All non-cost evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than the Cost/Price Factor.
 The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is
reasonable and complete; a color rating is not assigned to the cost/price factor.  Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost
and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government will determine completeness of the offeror's proposal by verifying
that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented in a clear and useful format.  In
Cost Reimbursable proposals the Government will evaluate the realism of each offerors' proposed costs.  In firm fixed price proposals the
Government reserves the right to conduct a realism analysis of the offeror's proposed price

|Relevancy                   |Definition                                                                                                |
|Very Relevant               |Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope, magnitude of effort, dollar value,   |
|                            |contract type and complexities this solicitation requires.                                                |
|Relevant                    |Past/Present performance effort involved much of the scope, magnitude of effort, dollar value, contract   |

|Somewhat Relevant           |Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope, magnitude of effort, dollar value, contract   |
|                            |type and complexities this solicitation requires.                                                         |
|Not Relevant                |Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope, magnitude of effort, dollar value,  |
|                            |contract type and complexities this solicitation requires.                                                |
|                            |If a past/present performance citation is relevant to the PWS tasks however, the identified offeror/vendor|
|                            |will not be performing those tasks on this solicitation, the citation will be assessed as not relevant.   |

** The past performance evaluation will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an offeror’s recent and relevant present/past performance. For
each instance of past performance, the evaluators will first determine if the individual effort meets the recency definition set forth in the
RFP. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated further.  Next it will be evaluated for relevancy. Past
performance information that is found Not Relevant will not be evaluated further.

If an offeror is utilizing a teaming arrangement, vendor partner(s), subcontractors, etc…, then the offeror must provide a breakdown of
responsibilities at the technical/management subtask level. The Government understands there may be areas of overlap. Relevancy will be
evaluated based on the task(s) the offeror states each subcontractor is to be responsible. If a past/present performance citation is relevant to
the PWS tasks however, the identified offeror/vendor on the citation will not be performing those tasks on this solicitation, the citation will
be assessed as not relevant.

For each instance of an offeror’s past performance that meets the recency timeframe, the evaluators will then assess relevancy of that instance
of past performance. This part of the evaluation will conclude with the Agency assessing a relevancy rating utilizing the above definitions
focusing on and targeting performance which is relevant to Technical/Management subfactors and the Price/Cost factor.  For each instance of an
offeror’s past performance that meets relevancy, the evaluators will then assess a quality of performance. The evaluators assess a relevancy
rating utilizing the above definitions (Table 2) focusing on and targeting performance which is relevant to the Technical/Management sub-
factors.  Evaluators do not assess an overall relevancy rating at the Factor level. Further, the Government is not bound by the offeror's
opinion of relevancy.

*** Performance Quality Assessment.  The Government will consider the performance quality of present/past citations that meet both the recency
and relevancy criteria. For each past and present performance citation that meets both recency and relevancy criteria, the performance quality
of the work performed will be assessed for the technical and management approach sub-factors, however, all aspects of performance that relate to
this procurement may be considered. The quality assessment consists of an in-depth evaluation of the information provided in the offeror’s Past
performance proposal volume, the past performance questionnaire responses, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) information,
interviews with Government customers and fee determining officials, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with
Defense Contract Mangement Agency (DCMA) officials or other sources known to the Government. The quality assessment may result in a positive or
adverse finding. Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or
any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system. For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider
the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained
improvements. Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated. The
Government will use the Performance Quality Assessment ratings in Table 3 above.

(ASSESSMENT RATINGS FOR THE PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR)****

|Rating                      |Description                                                                                               |
|Substantial Confidence      |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the government has a high expectation that the |
|                            |offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                                    |
|Satisfactory Confidence     |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the government has a reasonable expectation    |
|                            |that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                           |
|Limited                     |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the government has a low expectation that the  |
|Confidence                  |offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                                    |
|No                          | Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the government has no expectation that the    |
|Confidence                  |offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                                         |
|Unknown Confidence          |No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that  |
|(Neutral)                   |no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.                                    |

**** As a result of the recency, relevancy, and quality assessments, the Government evaluation team will then assign an integrated performance
confidence assessment rating from Table 4 above.  The resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the past performance factor
level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance.

More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than a less recent or relevant effort.
A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating.
Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant
record of favorable performance.


3.       Number of Contracts to be Awarded.  The Government intends to award one contract for the Enterprise Attack Analysis Program; however,
the Government reserves the right to make no award at all.

4.       Discussions.  If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions,
offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision.
