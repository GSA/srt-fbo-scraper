Executive Summary
The Marine Corps Logistics Base (MCLB) Albany, Georgia, Site Survey was conducted from 15 to 19 November 2010. Representatives from Marine Corps Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center - Atlantic met with the MCLB Albany personnel. The Site Survey Team's goal was to capture the "as-is" baseline of the current Emergency Response System. The Installation representatives candidly discussed their systems, infrastructure, organization, and technological capabilities and limitations. The MCLB Albany has a conventional analog Radio Frequency Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system; it transmits in the 138 Megahertz (MHz) to 155 MHz frequency range. The system is not capable of Over-the-Air Rekeying or Over-the-Air Programming, nor is it Project 25 compliant. Current operations are unencrypted. The system is a collection of components; it does not have a unique vendor or System Identification. The MCLB Albany system interoperates with surrounding communities at 800 MHz via two ACU-1000 systems. The current system provides coverage over 100% of the base. In-building coverage is limited in the industrial warehouse area. The MCLB Albany has two LMR towers. The Dispatch Site Tower is in good condition. The Repeater Site Tower has potentially significant physical problems, including loose guy wires and an unsecure foundation. The MCLB Albany has a consolidated dispatch center that includes Provost Marshal's Office (PMO)/Fire/Emergency Medical Service call takers and PMO desk sergeants. Call takers also monitor the Intrusion Detection System. The MCLB Albany's dispatch center is not a registered Public Safety Access Point (PSAP). Dougherty County is the local PSAP. The dispatch center is Enhanced 911 capable. The E911 system is not connected into the Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) infrastructure; it is essentially a standalone system. Dispatchers do not have a Computer Aided Dispatch program or other mapping capability. The MCLB Albany self-reports receiving an average of 200 emergency calls per month and 1,200 non-emergency calls per month.

The MCLB Albany was unable to provide an inventory of the antennas mounted on the Dispatch Tower Site Tower. 2.1.3.4 Building

Building 7520 consists of the dispatch center, PMO work areas, and the ACU-1000 equipment closet. The Building is a brick structure constructed in 1957. The building is staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and 365 days per year (24/7/365). Access is granted by a security officer who operates the door control located inside the dispatch area. There are alarm connections and video monitoring inside the building, including Intrusion Detection System (IDS), power, and fire. The equipment closet is in good condition, but does not have any room for expansion. There is fiber and copper connectivity to the building. Cables from the Dispatch Tower into the equipment room run along the ceiling and lay across the florescent lighting. This has the potential to cause RF interference as well as a fire.

2.1.3.5

Power

All of the assets in the equipment closet run off 120/240 Volts Alternating Current (VAC) single-phase commercial power. The circuit box has a 350 amp main breaker and there appears to be no room for expansion. Power for the RF equipment is conditioned through a PowerWare FE Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). The UPS unit provides intermediate power until the Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) transfers the load to the backup generator. Backup power for Building 7520 is provided by a Cummings Diesel generator that operates at 120/240V, single-phase, with a 140 gallon fuel tank. The generator's calculated runtime is 21.5 hours, based on an average consumption of 6.5 gallons per hour under load. Figure 2-5 is a photograph of the generator at Building 7520.

Tower

The Repeater Site Tower is a 130 foot AGL guyed tower. It was manufactured by Rhone and installed January 1986. The lower section of the tower was recently replaced after being struck by a front end loader. The Site Survey Team identified several issues with this tower. The guy wires are loose (Figure 2-7) and one of them passes between powers lines (Figure 2-8). The base of the tower is not secured to the asphalt foundation; one piece of rebar prevents lateral movement (Figure 2-9). The tower anchors are not grounded and one anchor is a wood pole.

Building

The Repeater Site equipment shelter is a prefabricated metal building on a concrete slab (refer to Figure 2-6). It is located five feet from the Repeater Site Tower. Mr. Eric Strom, Communications and Information Systems Division (CISD)/G-6, said the equipment shelter was constructed approximately ten years ago. The shelter has two small windows and is secured by a key lock; there is no surrounding fence. There were no intrusion alarm connections inside the shelter. A Monaco Fire Alarm system remote is monitored in the dispatch but Mr. Strom said it is not functional. The Site Survey Team found the shelter in fair condition; however, the interior grounding cable was not connected to an earth ground.

2-16

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0004-0.1

The shelter's primary power is 120V with 22 3-prong simplex outlets, nine of which are used. The circuit breaker panel has a main 200 amp breaker and it appears to have no room for expansion. 2.1.4.5 Power

All equipment at the Repeater Site shelter runs off 120/240 VAC single-phase commercial power. Two APC 1500 Smart UPS units provide interim power until the ATS transfers the load to the backup generator. A backup John Deere diesel generator with a 200 gallon fuel tank was installed in October 2010 along with a new ATS. The generator provides 120/240V, single-phase power. All power is cleaned through three 12-volt batteries. The calculated runtime is 30.7 hours based on an average consumption rate of 6.5 gallons per hour under load. There is a new fence around the generator area. Figure 2-10 is a photograph of the Repeater Site generator.

The surveyed subscribers use various models of radio equipment; there is no apparent standard for equipment or its distribution. In addition to these subscriber units, MCLB Albany owns five XTS 5000R handheld radio for communications with the local hospital emergency rooms. The base's ambulance is also equipped with mobile radios programmed for the Hospital Emergency Administrative Radio (HEAR) network. The Site Survey Team identified 811 new-in-boxes, P25 compliant, XTS 2500 handheld radios stored in the Direct Service Stock Control (DSSC) Warehouse (Building 1330). The radios are
2-18

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0004-0.1

banded for Ultra High Frequency (UHF) 380 - 400 MHz; Albany transmits in the VHF range. The radios are two-years-old and out of warranty. The Marine Corps purchased the radios for $2,000 each; it would cost $950 per radio to re-band them for VHF transmission. 2.1.7 Manpower/Training

Maintenance is provided by the Ground Electronics Maintenance (GEM) shop. The shop has two General Schedule (GS) civilians who were trained as United States Marine Corps (USMC) Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 2800. These personnel were sent to Camp Lejeune for radio repair training. The MCLB Albany's Public Safety department includes First Responders. There are 36 Fire/Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and 71 PMO First Responders. All first responders are provided with on-the-job training (OJT) for radio operations. 2.1.8 Maintenance/Logistics

The MCLB Albany did not have a consolidated radio shop or radio technicians for more than ten years. During that time, all subscribers supported their own radio and equipment purchases, maintenance, and repair. In August 2010, the CISD/G-6 established a GEM shop. GEM has started identifying radios and related assets and assumed responsibility for equipment sustainment until an E-LMR system is implemented. The GEM shop technicians are funded through August 2011. Public Works maintains the RF Equipment buildings, including the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and UPS equipment. There is no vendor support for MCLB Albany's RF system. All equipment is out of warranty.

Proposed Sites

In preparation for transition from the LMR network to an E-LMR network, MCLB Albany has begun work to secure two new proposed sites for E-LMR towers. Both sites have received approval from the Installations and Logistics Division. 4.2.1 Proposed Site #1 (Behind Game Warden Building)

Proposed Site #1 is located just behind the Game Warden Shack. The site is already cleared of all foliage. The site is 240 feet above sea level in a remote location. The site was planned for a 199 foot E-LMR tower. Per Mr. Strom, a power survey has already been completed. Figure 4-1 is a photograph of Proposed Site #1.

4.2.2

Proposed Site #2

Proposed Site #2 is located adjacent to the Fire Department. The site is 205 feet above sea level; it is flat and level, but tends to flood with minimal rain. The site showed evidence of recent standing water. The site has many pine trees and is surrounded by large warehouses. Along the front of the site, a telephone communications trench is ten feet underground. The site is proposed for a 199 foot E-LMR tower. Mr. Strom said a power survey has been completed.

Recommendations
Due to the condition of the Repeater Site Tower, a full tower analysis should be conducted to determine serviceability. Consider developing a unified training plan for LMR/E-LMR users. Identify funding for the current LMR system. In its current condition, the system is subject to imminent failure without attention. Given MCLB Albany's priority set in MROC DM20-2010 and MROC DM40-2010, a new system is several years away. Reprogram the CAMA trunks to allow the third caller to enter a queue or be automatically forwarded to the county PSAP. Complete a full inventory and accountability of LMR base assets on the Installation.

Executive Summary
The Blount Island Command (BIC), FL, Site Survey was conducted from 16 ­ 19 November 2010. Representatives from Marine Corps Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center - Atlantic met with the BIC personnel. The Site Survey Team's goal was to capture the "as-is" baseline of the current Emergency Response System (ERS), consisting of Enterprise Land Mobile Radio and Consolidated Emergency Response System. The Installation representatives candidly discussed their systems, infrastructure, organization, and technological capabilities and limitations. The BIC operates on a conventional Radio Frequency (RF) system utilizing Motorola XTS 2500 handheld radios. Two Motorola GR300 repeaters and one MTR 2000 repeater are installed across the Command. The BIC has one RF tower. The BIC is authorized to transmit in the 380 to 391 Megahertz (MHz) frequency range; however, the repeaters only operate in the 407 to 420 MHz range. Consequently, the operating frequencies do not fall within the allocated military frequency range. The current RF system covers 100% of BIC. Although BIC depends on outside agencies for emergency support, the base's Land Mobile Radio infrastructure does not interoperate with the City of Jacksonville first responders. The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO) supplied BIC with a mobile radio, but it is not monitored. BIC has one ACU-1000; due to lack of equipment knowledge, it is not currently in service. The BIC has a Marine Corps Police Department (MCPD) for law enforcement issues. All other first responders and dispatch services are provided by the City of Jacksonville. The MCPD is centered in Building 104 and is staffed by a desk sergeant who answers on-base calls for law enforcement emergencies only via an administrative line (904-714-6100). The administrative phone number is posted on the MCPD vehicles. The BIC desk sergeant telephone number receives notification of emergencies, as well as administrative calls, such as employment inquiries and operator queries. The JSO receives all 911 calls from BIC. The JSO also dispatches Jacksonville Fire/Emergency Medical Service and Police. The JSO is a registered primary Public Safety Answering Point.

Overview

The Emergency Management Command and Coordination (EMC2) Site Survey was conducted from 16 to 19 November 2010 to establish a capabilities "baseline" of Blount Island Command (BIC).

1.1

Base Details

The BIC covers 1,235.2 acres. 901.6 acres are on Blount Island; 333.6 acres are a dredge and conservation site across the St. Johns River. BIC is the newest Marine Corps installation; the land was purchased in 2004 following an 18-1/2 year lease. There are two organizational functions at Blount Island: Marine Corps Support Facility - Blount Island (MCSF-BI), responsible for traditional base and facilities support functions under Marine Corps Installations East (MCI East), and BIC, responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing the logistics functions for the Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) under Marine Corps Logistics Command. In addition to the Base infrastructure, B.F. Goodrich, Inc, owns and occupies a private production facility onboard the Blount Island Command. Table 1-1 represents the population, as provided by the Command, at BIC and co-located private facilities.

Populated Areas

There is one populated area at Blount Island; it is occupied during the standard Monday through Friday work week. On weekends, outside of normal working hours, the Base conducts ammunition movements. Due to these movements of ammunition, the Base intentionally limits the number of permanent buildings. There is no housing on Blount Island. Figure 1-2 identifies BIC's population coverage, points of entry, and first responder locations as provided by GEOFidelis The indented area surrounds the Goodrich facility. BIC has two points of entry: North Gate and South Gate. The guarded North Gate is the primary access point. The South Gate is an access point to the adjacent Jacksonville Port (Jax Port); that gate is only open for coordinated movement of equipment. The MCPD is the only first responder on the Installation. All other first responders come from the City of Jacksonville.

Survey Results
Enterprise Land Mobile Radio
Current System

The BIC operates on a conventional Radio Frequency (RF) system utilizing Motorola XTS 2500 handheld radios. Two Motorola GR300 repeaters and one MTR 2000 repeater are installed across the Command. There is no record of repeater history or ownership. The BIC is authorized to transmit in the 380 to 391 Megahertz (MHz) frequency range; however, the repeaters only operate in the 407 to 420 MHz range. Consequently, the operating frequencies do not fall within the allocated military frequency range. Although BIC depends on outside agencies for emergency support, the Base's Land Mobile Radio (LMR) infrastructure does not interoperate with the City of Jacksonville's. The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO) supplied BIC with a mobile radio, but it is not monitored. BIC has one ACU-1000; due to lack of equipment knowledge, it is not currently in service. The BIC's handheld radios are Project 25 (P25) compliant. Table 2-1 identifies specific information related to BIC's current RF system, excluding subscriber units.

Coverage

According to BIC and JSO, Blount Island has full RF coverage. Mrs. Pam Saffore, MCPD Deputy Police Chief, reports that there is RF penetration issues inside the hull of ships. As BIC supports the MPF and contractors regularly perform ship maintenance, first responders are likely to address emergencies inside a ship. The MCPD also reports inbuilding RF penetration issues at their own building, Building 104. Additionally, Mr. Fred Rogers, Installation Emergency Manager, and MCPD Officers Josue Hernandez and James Ludwig report cross-talk interference and radios automatically entering scanning mode. Reportedly, this is because when the three existing repeaters are used for basewide coverage, other users also have access to these channels; this causes excessive traffic for the three channels.

Tower

The BIC has one 60 foot self-supporting tower located at Building 100. The tower was constructed in April 2006. Stress analysis, wind shear analysis, and soil analysis studies were conducted in 2005 and 2006 prior to tower construction. No tower analysis or inspections have been completed since construction. A Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance assessment was performed in January 2010. The tower is positioned immediately next to the rear entrance to Building 100. It is surrounded by a locked chain link and barbed wire fence. The Site Survey team noted that the tower and fence are in good condition. Figure 2-2 illustrates the tower, surrounding fence, and proximity to Building 100.

Power

The primary power source for Building 100 is 277/480 Volts Alternating Current (VAC) threephase commercial power. A Powerware UPS conditions the power and provides backup in case of an outage. Building 100 also has a backup diesel generator with an Auto Transfer Switch. Based on the current load and a full tank of fuel, the generator is rated to support operations for up to 3 days, 14 hours (122 hours). The BIC conducts a weekly generator run test. The Facilities department performs preventative maintenance on a quarterly basis; a load test is done annually. 2.1.4 2.1.4.1 Building 450 Site Current RF System

Building 450 contains one Motorola MTR 2000 repeater and one Radio Frequency Systems (RFS) brand untuned, Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Duplexer. The MTR 2000 provides analog, conventional coverage to subscribers in the area of the ship docks.

Power

There is no dedicated power for the RF repeater. The RF repeater is plugged into a standard three-prong wall outlet. 2.1.5 Subscriber Units

The Marine Corps Network Operations and Security Center (MCNOSC) E-LMR System Capacity Analysis report did not provide any subscriber unit inventories for BIC that can be used for comparison. Few of these units are used by first responders; the majority have been distributed to other base personnel, local contractor support, and JaxPort. Table 2-11 identifies the allocation of the BIC subscriber units as provided by the Command.

Manpower/Training

The BIC's LMR system is maintained by the Command's OPS Division. The Command does not have dedicated RF communications personnel. The PMO has 61 government staff members and six contractors. The enlisted staff is trained through the Military Occupational Specialty School. The contractor and civilian support attends a private job training academy. Both schools include basic radio operator training. 2.1.7 Maintenance/Logistics

The BIC does not have dedicated maintenance or logistics support for the current RF system. The Information Security Management Office (ISMO) performs occasional support functions; however, there are no trained service providers. NT&T, a private contractor, provides on-site support as needed.

3.2

Quick Wins

A quick win is defined as an item that the project can help the base procure or a standard it can help them meet within a short-term time frame. The following quick wins were identified for BIC:
ˇ ˇ

ˇ

Program the PBX to allow callers dialing 904-714-6100 to select whether their call is an emergency for routing to dispatch or to the administrative attendant. Update all existing Memoranda of Understanding (MOU)/Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) currently on file with JSO and JFRD to reflect the establishment of the MCPD and their role. Establish a procedure with JSO and JFRD, where all calls for service to the installation are connected as a conference call to the MCPD desk sergeant rather than simply transferring the call. This would ensure that all of the emergency telephone calls are being recorded as required by state law.

Interviews

During the BIC Site Survey, representatives provided input on their departments and agencies within the Emergency Response System (ERS). The following narratives document these interviews: 4.2.1 ISMO

Mr. Oscar Garcia, Information Technology (IT) Specialist, and GySgt Michael Gaskell, ISMO Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC), reported that BIC's radio infrastructure is outdated and does not meet the needs of the subscriber community. GySgt Gaskell said the repeaters used for the radio infrastructure were in the inventory when he reported to the command and do not operate in the authorized military frequency band. Due to the limited coverage provided by the current RF system and the lack of interoperability with surrounding supporting agencies, the Base Commander lacks situational awareness (SA) of isolated incidents on board the Installation. Mr. Garcia and GySgt Gaskell also said that the S-6 needs a MOS 0629 or Communications Technician to support the RF infrastructure. 4.2.2 PMO

Ms. Pam Saffore, Deputy Chief of Police, said that the MCPD has limited in-building coverage within Building 104, the current MCPD office. Ms. Saffore also said that the Boat Patrol is affected by limited coverage in the areas near the boat slips. Ms. Saffore would like more interoperability with the JSO and JFRD for incidents that occurs on the Installation. The MCPD has no interoperability with either of those agencies. Ms. Saffore also stated that none of the RF transmissions or telephone lines is recorded and that she would like all personnel who fulfill the desk sergeant duties to be trained to a minimum level of Telecommunicator I and II. MCPD Officers Josue Hernandez and James Ludwig were also interviewed. They stated that they frequently experience cross talk interference when using the RF system and that their portable radios randomly enter scanning mode causing delays in their ability to transmit. They also stated that they have to switch over to the BIC Main channel when near the ships and that all other subscribers on the base could hear their transmissions, since this is a shared channel. 4.2.3 JFRD

Captain JP King, JFRD Station 48, reported that there is limited to poor RF coverage in the hull of ships.

4.3

Local Initiatives

There are no Local Initiatives at BIC.

4-2

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0005-0.1

4.4

Proposed Sites

There is one proposed site near the Main Gate. That site has not been approved for tower construction.

4.5

Recommendations

The JSO radio is located in the Communications Room, Building 100. That room is not staffed and the ACU-1000 is inoperable, so the traffic cannot be monitored. The Site Survey Team recommends moving that radio from the Communications Room to the desk sergeant position for regular monitoring.

System Requirements Review
SRR Overview

SRR-2 is a multi-disciplined product and process assessment to ensure the E-LMR ERI preliminary system configuration is capable to meet the operational needs of the Government as derived from the CPD. This review will be conducted with the Government and contractor after the post contract award meeting. This review assesses the system requirements as captured in the E-LMR (Slice) SDS are addressed and can be satisfied by the proposed system configuration and installation solution. Of critical importance to this review is the mutual (Government and contractor) understanding of program technical risk inherent in the E-LMR (Slice) SDS. Acceptable level of risk is instrumental to a successful review. The purpose of SRR-2 is to evaluate the contractor's proposed system solution to determine whether the requirements are sufficiently addressed, well understood and consistent with the preferred system solution, and whether traceability of system's requirements to the CPD is maintained. A successful review is predicated on the review team's determination that the system requirements, preferred system concept, available technology, and program resources (infrastructure, schedule, staffing and processes) form a satisfactory basis for proceeding to the first production article. Completion of this review should provide the following: 1. Acceptance of the E-LMR (Slice) SDS by the contractor. 2. Allocation of system requirements to hardware, human and software subsystems. 3. Identification of all software components (tactical, support, deliverable, non-deliverable). 4. A comprehensive risk assessment for first production article.

Functional Configuration Audit
FCA Overview

The objective of the FCA is to verify that each CI actually measured performance in compliance with its performance requirements. Qualification and/or acceptance test data is reviewed to verify that the CI performs as required by its Functional and Allocated Configuration Documentation (FCD and ACD). The FCA will be conducted on each CI that is representative of those released for production. For cases where CI qualification can only be determined through integrated system testing, the FCA for such CIs will not be considered final until completion of such integrated testing. WHAT: FCA is the formal examination of the "as-tested" characteristics of a configuration item where the focus is on design and performance suitability. FCA provides a systematic comparison of requirements with the results of tests, analyses, or inspections. The objective is to verify that the CI has achieved the performance specified in its functional, or allocated, configuration identification documents, and that its operational and support documents are complete and satisfactory. An FCA is essentially a review of the configuration item's test/analysis data including software unit test results to validate the intended function or performance is met. The FCA is used to verify that the actual performance of a configuration item meets the requirements contained in its performance specification and to certify that the configuration item has met those requirements. The FCA determines if the system produced (including production representative prototypes or Low-Rate Initial Production [LRIP] units) is capable of meeting the technical performance requirements established in the specifications and test plans. Among the issues addressed are: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ
ˇ

Readiness issues for continuing design, continuing verifications, production, training, deployment, operations, support and disposal have been resolved. Verification is comprehensive and complete. Configuration audits, including completion of all change actions, have been completed for all CIs. Risk management planning is/has been updated for production. Systems Engineering planning is updated for production. Critical achievements, success criteria and metrics have been established for production.

WHEN: The FCA is normally performed prior to LRIP and prior to or in conjunction with a PCA. Although an FCA is only required once for each CI or system, a number of FCA-like activities may be accomplished at other times during the life cycle of the CI or system. The time frame for audits will vary depending on the particular program. The CI's complexity may dictate an incremental audit approach throughout development until the completion of

In the case of software, examine the Verification RTM to ensure requirements in the SDS, Computer Program Functional Specification (CPFS), Software Design Document, Software Design Product Package (SDPP) and IDD, as applicable, have been successfully tested and documented in the associated Test Plan, Procedures and Descriptions. Was the software tested? Do the test plans for the software cover all of the requirements in the software specification documents? Did all the tests pass? Ensure testing follows approved procedures. Review approved changes to determine the extent to which the item varies from applicable specification and standards and to form a basis for satisfactory compliance with those specifications and standards. Review and sample the drawings of parts to ensure the availability of essential manufacturing test data. Ensure the validity of data, reports, and analyses for final configuration. Ensure all documentation used by the team become part of the FCA minutes. Certify satisfactory completion of the audit.

Physical Configuration Audit
PCA Overview

The PCA is used to examine the actual configuration of the CI that is representative of the product configuration in order to verify that the related design documentation matches the design of the deliverable CI. In performance based acquisition environment, the PCA addresses the accuracy of the documentation reflecting the production design. It is also used to validate many of the supporting processes that the contractor uses in the production of the CI. The PCA is also used to verify that any elements of the CI that were redesigned after the completion of the FCA also meet the requirements of the CI's performance specification. A PCA is the formal examination of the "as built" physical configuration or "as coded" total system software conforms to the design and construction process or technical documentation that defines it. It is performed during the Production and Deployment Phase and focuses on production suitability. The PCA verifies the related design documentation matches the design of the deliverable CI. For COTS or non-developmental items, a PCA may be performed to determine adequacy of interface requirements documents developed at Government expense. Where the Government does not plan to control the detail design, it is still essential that the contractor conduct an internal PCA to define the starting point for controlling the production design and to establish a product baseline. A PCA encompasses review of engineering drawings, technical documentation/data management, hardware and software. A 100 percent review of all documentation and hardware/software would be time prohibitive for most large acquisitions. For this reason, a 10-20 percent sampling is recommended. However, the review may be expanded to 100 percent for potentially high-risk programs.

MCSCPM IS&I

E-LMR ERI PWS VERSION 1.55, 7 NOVEMBER 2012

The PCA formalizes the Product Baseline, including specifications and the technical data package so that future changes can be made only through formal configuration change control procedures. The PCA confirms: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ
ˇ

The subsystem and CI/CSCI PCAs have been successfully completed. The integrated decision database is valid and represents the product. All items have been baselined. (Functional and allocated baselines established. The product baseline will be established after the PCA.) Changes to previous baselines have been completed. Testing deficiencies have been resolved and appropriate changes implemented. System processes are current and can be executed.

WHEN: The PCA is conducted on the first production item. The time frame for PCAs will vary depending on the particular program. The CI's complexity may dictate an incremental PCA approach throughout development until the completion of qualification testing. The PCA schedule should be delineated in the Configuration Management Plan and may be included in the system engineering management plan. The PCA is normally performed only once. However, additional PCAs may be necessary if there is a change in the design after the Product Baseline has been established, or if: ˇ
ˇ

The original production line has been shut down for a time and then production restarted. Production is awarded to a new contractor or vendor.

WHO: The responsibility resides in PdM ERS. The PdM has overall disposition authority on audit results and reports. The PdMs designee, who may be the SE or LMS, will ensure the PCA is properly executed. Government personnel usually perform the PCA. Government personnel include representatives of: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ
ˇ

Program Office (e.g., project officer, contracting officer). Systems engineering personnel (e.g., configuration management, quality, manufacturing, reliability, maintainability). Configuration status accounting personnel (representing the Software Support Activity and/or Supply Chain Management Center). Acquisition logistics personnel. Others, to include the User Community, as required.

Contractor personnel should participate in the audit as provided for in the contract.

WHERE: The PCA is normally performed at the contractor's facility where the technical documentation and equipment is available. The PCA is used to examine each CI/CSCI by reviewing a representative of the product to determine that the related design documentation matches the design of the deliverable CI/CSCI. The PCA is conducted following procedures established in the Configuration Management Plan. The PdMs designee will serve as PCA team chairman and the following activities: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Conduct pre-audit assessment. Ensure necessary resources, documentation, and facilities are available to conduct the audit. Identify the percentage of documentation to be reviewed. Perform or delegate responsibility for conducting the audit. Ensure access to contractor technical staff, for example, quality assurance specialist and project system engineer. In the case of software, ensure access to the Software Development Library such as source code and related documentation and the Software Development File. Establish multidisciplinary technical team. Perform or delegate responsibility for conducting the audit. Ensure the availability of personnel skilled in the applicable software languages and conventions for documenting and using software products and as well as familiarity with applicable specifications and standards. The PCA team will perform the following functions: Determine the configuration item to be audited. Verify acceptance procedures are valid. Ensure only current and approved documents and versions are in use. If software, review the Software Product Specification and Software Version Document. Ensure completeness of approved and released technical documentation to include suitability of items for follow on production and appropriate for operational, maintenance and logistics support purposes. Perform detail review of engineering drawings, specifications, technical data and test used in the production of HWCIs, and design documentation, code listings and manuals for CSCIs. Other documentation, such as waivers and ECP status, also are subject to review. Review the released engineering documentation and quality control records to ensure the "as built" and "as coded" configuration is reflected by this documentation. Ensure acceptance test requirements are adequate for acceptance of production unit configuration items by quality assurance. Certify satisfactory completion of the audit. Review results of FCA.

E-LMR System Design Specification

NSWC-CORDIV-FT31-SDS-20110601-001 v1.30

1 Scope
This System Design Specification (SDS) derives specific mission-level performance requirements and attributes from reference documents such as the Statement of Need (SON), Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and Capability Production Document (CPD) associated with the E-LMR (Slice) program of record. An overarching restriction is that all requirements cited in this SDS pertain to the threshold level; although objective needs are identified, they are not planned to be addressed when they exceed threshold requirements. The SDS also identifies the Department of Defense (DoD) and industry standards that will be used to establish the architecture, locations, capacities and configurations of the E-LMR system for all applicable installations. Lastly, the SDS details the expected producibility, operability, maintainability and supportability of the system. The Assistant Secretary of Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, (ASN[RDA]), SDS Guidebook--specifically, Appendix C for C4I systems as modified for commercial off the shelf (COTS) systems--serves as the template.

1.1 Introduction
E-LMR was originally conceived as a system to provide reliable communications capability for First Responders and mission-essential personnel at USMC supporting establishment installations, ranges and related service areas worldwide (i.e., the enterprise). This all-encompassing system is referred to within the Emergency Response Systems (ERS) program office as "Complete E-LMR." A subset of Complete E-LMR is "E-LMR (Slice)." As defined in the MROC DM 40-20101 supporting presentation, "E-LMR coverage for Consolidated Emergency Response System (CERS) consists of housing areas and major on-installation population centers." As a practical matter, this requirement also would include the roadways interconnecting these two areas. Aspects of Complete E-LMR not included in E-LMR (Slice) include radio frequency (RF) coverage of range training areas and enhanced management capabilities for enterprisewide users.

1.2 SDS Terminology
This SDS presents information intended for the implementation and fielding of E-LMR (Slice) on all applicable USMC installations. For the purposes of this SDS, all references to the E-LMR (Slice) system to be implemented on those particular installations will be referred to simply as "E-LMR" or "the E-LMR system." Where a distinction between Complete E-LMR and E-LMR (Slice) is required, the appropriate term will be used.

1.4 Approach to Design
E-LMR alternatives have been analyzed in a previous Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The chosen alternative for the E-LMR system is a trunked land mobile radio (LMR) system that complies with the Phase 1 American National Standards Institute/ Telecommunications Industry Association (ANSI/TIA)-102 series technical standards. Additionally, the system must have the capability to incorporate a future software-only upgrade to achieve compliance with Phase 2 (12.5 KHz, 2-slot TDMA) standards.

2 Operational Requirements 2.1 Missions
E-LMR is a digital trunked land mobile radio system that will be interoperable, secure (Controlled Unclassified Information [CUI]), reliable, survivable and versatile. As a tiered system with installation, regional and enterprise level operations, E-LMR will enable effective EMC2 and All-Hazards communications vital in reducing the loss of life in crisis situations or incidents for USMC installations worldwide. E-LMR will facilitate command and coordination that enables prompt deployment and effective use of First Responder resources (e.g., fire-fighting, provost marshal office and emergency medical services).

2.2 Threats
USMC installations face a multitude of diverse threats including natural hazards, human-caused events and technologically caused events. The ability to provide critical direction for using resources, collaborating and planning to facilitate efforts to prepare for, respond to and recover from All-Hazards incidents is significant in saving lives and ensuring operational readiness and mission success. Installation emergency management (IEM) has four essential phases: preparation, response, recovery and mitigation. Further, installation commanders may need additional federal, state, local, tribal, utility, non-governmental organization (NGO) and private entity support to effectively respond to and recover from All-Hazards incidents. Besides threats faced by the installation, its personnel and command elements while performing basic functions, the E-LMR system itself also faces threats. These include mostly programmatic considerations such as: policy changes for ongoing certification requirements involving information assurance (IA), safety, interoperability, spectrum usage (long-term availability and possible relocation to a different frequency band), technology obsolescence and production end-of-life for COTS parts.

2.3 Environment
IEM First Responders use portable and mobile RF equipment primarily in outdoor environments throughout their installations worldwide. This also is true of RF repeater site fixed facility operations. Indoor IEM operations by First Responders also are part of the required suite of operational scenarios but impose a less stringent set of environmental requirements than their outdoor counterparts. These outdoor settings, along with those associated with portable and mobile use by First Responders on USMC installations, comprise the complete set of temperature, humidity, pressure, shock, vibration and electromagnetic environments associated with portable, mobile and fixed equipment. The exact range of these requirements for operational and storage modes are detailed in Section 14 and follow fairly closely to those imposed on systems associated with their civilian First Responder counterparts. The E-LMR system is not suitable for nor expected to be deployed in a tactical environment.

3 Key Interface Profiles
Key interface profiles (KIPs) are intended to support compatibility with, and extension of, Global Information Grid (GIG) interfaces and services. A crucial enabler of this goal is adherence to DoD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR)-mandatory GIG Net-Centric information technology (IT) standards in any resultant E-LMR system. In accordance with the Deputy Secretary of Defense policy memorandum of August 1, 2001, all DoD non-tactical land mobile radio must be compliant with ANSI/TIA-102 series standards (also known as APCO P25). A starting point for identifying the proper IT standards requires examination of the TIA-102 P25 general system model. Figure 1 provides a simplified view of that model.

Figure 1 TIA-102 P25 General System Model

In Figure 1, the labels between subsystems, end systems and components represent ANSI/TIA-102 series IT standards that deal with interfaces and protocols. A necessary step in the final certification of the E-LMR system will be the adoption of these IT standards in the DISR. The steps for accomplishing that were initiated in 2009. Since then, additional TIA-102 standards have been adopted and published by ANSI/TIA; the process of incorporating these standards into DISR should be continued to completion. At a broader level, the E-LMR system has KIP requirements with systems external to itself. These would primarily involve transport layer requirements as the services aspect for E-LMR is very limited in scope (i.e., plain-text voice and low-speed data transport). A logical representation of a System of Systems view of E-LMR is depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 System of Systems View of E-LMR

In this view, a clear demarcation between E-LMR and the external systems with which it intercommunicates is shown. Interaction with BTI and CERS is mostly limited to transport functionality that involve both interface and protocol level standards. A complete list of the applicable IT standards is included in Section 4 of this SDS. These documents comprise the entire set of KIPs for E-LMR. The purpose of CERS is to perform the same rapid emergency response services as an equivalent civilian dispatch center (referred to as a Public Safety Answering Point [PSAP]). CERS is a secure (sensitive but unclassified) system composed of hardware and software components that facilitate expedient emergency response. The main elements of CERS include but are not limited to: computer aided dispatch (CAD), interface to wireless communications systems (e.g., E-LMR), Enhanced 911 (E9-1-1) systems, Fire Station Alerting (FSA), mobile data computers (MDCs) and interfaces to other systems. The use of CAD assists in efficiently assessing emergencies, and expedites the dispatching of emergency resources. E9-1-1 includes the requirement for automatic number identification (ANI) and automatic location information (ALI) to process and expedite subscriber calls. CERS provides installation emergency response command and coordination using wired and wireless communications paths. CERS is the subset of EMC2 capabilities

necessary to coordinate installation-organic First Responder emergency and day-to-day operations. This encompasses law enforcement, structural fire, and emergency medical response agencies. CERS will extend its capability to the mobile First Responder through the use of MDCs, allowing for access to emergency responder databases, Records Management Systems and report generation tools.

5.2 IA Planning
The following IA-related policies are applicable to the E-LMR system and will be integrated into the IA planning process:  E-Government Act of 2002, Title III of Public Law 1207-347: Addresses privacy requirements. The E-LMR system collects, processes, stores and/or transmits personally identifiable information (PII). Fortunately, the requirements and processes put in place by the following DoD instructions and policies more than adequately address the requirements of Public Law 1207-347. DoDI 8500.2: The E-LMR system is physically installed and operated in secure facilities and equipment spaces aboard USMC installations throughout the conterminous United States (CONUS) enterprise. Radio network administrator access is controlled further through formal access approval, clearance and need-toknow verification, and CAC authentication. Security training ensures users know how to access the E-LMR system consistent with DoD IA policy. E-LMR subcomponents are tested for compliance during security testing and evaluation to ensure each subsystem and component meets DoDI 8500.2. The E-LMR program documents DoDI 8500.2 compliance using current DIACAP procedures. DoDI 8510.01: E-LMR uses this as the process by which IA capabilities and services can achieve certification and accreditation (C&A) by the designated approving authority (DAA) in the form of an authority to operate (ATO). Marine Corps Enterprise Information Assurance Directive (MCEIAD) 018: As a USMC program of record (POR), the E-LMR system uses this guidance, in concert with DoDI 8510.01, to implement and carry out the C&A process. SECNAVINST 5239.3A: The E-LMR system maintains confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) through the implementation of MAC III Sensitive IA controls. CIA is achieved through administrative controls (user clearance, access approval, need-toknow), CAC authentication, backups and port security.

investigation, in accordance with SECNAV M5510.30 Exhibit 5A, prior to the person in such a position performing any work.  National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Policy (NSTISSP) 11: The E-LMR program uses this guidance to ensure IA is achieved through the acquisition and appropriate implementation of evaluated or validated Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) and COTS IA and IA-enabled IT products.

5.3 IA Strategy
This E-LMR IA strategy is consistent with (and an extension of) the EMC2 IA strategy and involves specifying systems and subsystems that have the capability of supporting the controls required for a MAC III sensitive system. This support may be in the form of IA controls that are based on performance design, policy or standard operating procedures (SOPs). Further, the strategy will require initial and continuing adherence to the IA controls so that an ATO can be achieved initially and maintained over the course of the useful life of the system.

5.4 Certification and Approving Authorities
These personnel are the stakeholders responsible for initial and continuing IA C&A.

5.6 IA Requirements
Specific IA requirements will be based on a collection of performance design, policy and SOPs. IA controls will be implemented directly in the system and subsystems as part of the performance design. However, policy and SOPs can be implemented only by the staff responsible for system operation, maintenance and configuration control. As such, the system requirements include the ability to allow all such policy and SOPs to be realized. In terms of direct performance design requirements, the following IT-related control measures are required.       Incorporation of all IA controls in DoDI 8500.2 for MAC III sensitive systems. Exclusive use of NIST-certified encryption. Incorporation of all IA controls in NIST SP 800-53 for MAC III sensitive systems. Use of TIA-102 series AES, OTAR and key management. Exclusive use of applicable NIAP-validated common criteria evaluation and validation scheme (CCEVS) protection profiles. Incorporation of applicable Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) for operating systems and applications. Hardware modules that are hot-swappable. Software and applications that can be updated/patched while providing service. System production and deployment integrity measures to preclude introduction of malware, in any form, consisting of hardware, software or firmware that is not an authorized part of the design.

  

In terms of policy and SOP requirements, the following control measures are required.      Regularly scheduled updating and patching of all system software. Incorporation of all software updates and patches as authorized by the IA Manager (IAM). Prompt disabling (and removal) of compromised SUs from the radio network. Maintenance and upgrade of the system in strict adherence to a Change Control Board (CCB)-approved configuration. Operation and maintenance of the system infrastructure by IA personnel who are Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)-certified in accordance with DoDD 8570.01.

10 E-LMR Design Criteria
The E-LMR system design criteria shall be based on TIA-102 series standards, First Responder and industry best practices. These standards and practices are listed in Section 4.2. Appropriate DoD and NIST standards as listed in Section 4.1 shall overlay and, where necessary, supersede the TIA standards. The system design shall satisfy all M, SO and SO-R functional requirements listed in the appropriate column (for Phase 1 and Phase 2 designs) of the latest edition of the APCO P25 SOR. [Note: Careful review of the EMC2 concept of operations5 indicates there are no special or unusual operations contemplated by Marine Corps First Responders that are not accounted for in the functional requirements contained in the APCO P25 SOR.]

10.1 Transport: Networking
All intersite networking shall be provided by an emergency management command and coordination network (EMC2Net) based on Internet protocols as established by the IETF via requests for comments (RFCs) that are at the standards stage and listed in the DISR-Online database. These protocols are listed in Section 4.2. End-to-end quality of service (QoS) factors, on a one-way basis, include:     Latency: less than 135 msec (POP6 to POP). Jitter: less than 20 msec (measured per ITU-T Y.1541). Packet loss: less than 0.01 percent. If DiffServ7 is applied, then either Layer 2 or Layer 3 may be used, but not both.

IPv6 capability and exclusive use of ports and protocols approved in the most recent DISA Category Assurance List are required.

10.2 Transport: Communications
The E-LMR system is based on non-tactical, non-deployable P25 LMR technology as directed by the previously cited Deputy Secretary of Defense (NII) policy memorandum. As such, neither the newly developed Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) nor its associated set of legacy waveforms is applicable to this design.

10.3 Data Storage

10.10 Notional System Design Approach
A notional approach to implementing the E-LMR system design is depicted in Figure 4. Because the detail level is necessarily low for this notional approach, not every single element on the diagram will be addressed in this section. Some elements are composed of several physical pieces of equipment, and other components cannot be defined further without incorporating vendor-specific details. This section focuses on the functionality of the various components (and groups of components) depicted in Figure 4 rather than rigorously defining technical details of the components themselves. A grid reference system (visible around the entire perimeter of the diagram) will be cited in square brackets when applicable to aid in finding the subject functionality on the diagram. Figure 4 includes CERS subsystems and components to show the system context in which E-LMR will operate.

10.10.1

Dispatch Connectivity To/From Subscriber Units

Until a P25:Ec is fully implemented, a vendor-specific console system, depicted as "P25 Console End System" [F6] will be installed at the dispatch position. There may be one or more dispatch positions per installation. The dispatcher (or radio console operator) interacts with the console via the "radio dispatch display" [G6] and the keyboard/mouse, which is interfaced via a keyboard video monitor (KVM) switch [E8]. The console connects to the rest of the E-LMR architecture via Ethernet connectivity into the BTI Net [F5]. A cordless headset [E6], encrypted using digital enhanced cordless telecommunications (DECT) 6.0 technology, allows the dispatcher to securely conduct both telephone calls and P25 radio calls from the dispatch position without being tethered to the desktop position. Voice information being generated by the dispatcher is transported across the E-LMR LAN and into the RFSS [F3], the E-LMR Net Logging Record Servers [E3] and the RF repeater sites [H4]. The exact logic used to determine which repeater sites are used for transport of a given voice call is a function of the P25 trunking implementation. Two tiers of repeater sites are depicted: Those connected directly to the BTI Net [G4], and those connected through intermediate sites that physically "patch" the connectivity. In all cases where traffic is exchanged external to the BTI Net, it passes through one or more EBPSs [F5]. These serve several purposes:    Layer 2 and 3 transport and routing of E-LMR traffic between various system elements. Segmentation of traffic into functional "pipes" via virtual private network (VPN) and virtual local area network (VLAN) configurations. IA by firewalling the E-LMR network (both centralized and site networks) off from various transport alternatives, which may not be under complete Government control. IA by encrypting traffic with FIPS-compliant AES encryption. Maintains IA and isolation for data transiting into and out of EMC2.

 

Once the traffic reaches the repeater sites, it is relayed to the portable and mobile subscriber units via P25 digital, trunked RF in the allocated 380-400 MHz band [H3]. One or more physical repeaters and associated repeater frequency pairs may reside at each repeater site. Other authorized frequency bands also may be used at sites that require mutual aid with partners that operate in other than the 380-400 MHz band. All voice information sent over-the-air is encrypted with FIPS-compliant AES encryption. The key material for this encryption is controlled and generated at the enterprise level by Marine Corps Network Operations and Security Center (MCNOSC) [A8]. Once a key
UNCLASSIFIED - FOUO 47

E-LMR System Design Specification

NSWC-CORDIV-FT31-SDS-20110601-001 v1.30

is generated, it will be supplied to the regional control sites for distribution to a specific installation. Local (installation) key management servers and key loaders [F2] will be deployed to the installation to perform key management functions with subscriber equipment. The information path just described supports voice traffic in both directions: from the dispatch station to the SUs and from the SUs to the dispatch station. Implicit in the depiction of such things as BTI Net and "N x RF Repeater Sites" is the enterprise architecture being envisioned. Several of the functional groupings depicted in the diagram may span geographic and USMC organizational boundaries.

10.10.2

Subscriber Unit to Subscriber Unit Connectivity

Voice traffic may pass directly from SU to SU through affiliated repeater sites when dispatcher functionality is not required. This assumes the SUs have been programmed (e.g., talk-group, encryption keys) to allow this connectivity. A mobile or portable SU may talk to others who are connected to the same repeater site or, through the P25 trunking functionality, to a mobile or portable SU affiliated with another repeater site. The domain for this is depicted as "USMC P25 LOS8 Home Service Area" [H3] in the diagram and will consist of P25 digital trunked traffic operating in the mandated 12.5 kHz narrowband, 380-400 MHz. All this traffic can be monitored on the dispatch console and recorded on the Net Logging Record Server. If the SUs are so programmed (and frequencies are allocated as such), users may "talk around" the repeaters in a P25 simplex mode directly from unit to unit. All SUs will be AES capable and all voice traffic is intended to be encrypted.

10.10.3

Call Recording

A voice recorder function is shown attached to the E-LMR LAN and labeled as "E-LMR Net Logging Server" [E3]. The recorder receives all voice traffic from the network as Internet protocol (IP) data packets, not analog voice. This provides several advantages:    The recorder can be placed in several physical locations in the architecture; it is not tied to a specific location such as near a dispatch console. There can be multiple voice recorders, each serving a different function or for redundancy purposes. Voice traffic can carry meta-data in the same network packet, including information such as talk-group, SU ID or queue times.

LOS: line of sight.

UNCLASSIFIED - FOUO

E-LMR System Design Specification

NSWC-CORDIV-FT31-SDS-20110601-001 v1.30



Authorized access to recorded traffic can occur over the same network or can be pulled to a central, enterprise control site instead of in-person accessing media on the recorder.

10.10.4

Mobile Data Computer and Automatic Vehicle Location

Mobile SUs (those traditionally installed in motor vehicles) will have the ability to send and receive low speed (9.6 kbps) data to other devices in the E-LMR network. This data may be used for mapping information and GIS display on a mobile data computer [G3], for subscriber-to-subscriber messaging or for automatic vehicle location reporting. Data transits the network as IP packets, and source and destination addresses are used for routing decisions. This traffic, like voice traffic, is under full control of the system configuration. It is the intent of this portion of the system design to transfer GPS data to the CAD system via the E-LMR local area network. Position location may be sent autonomously based on time interval, speed, differential position or any combination of these parameters. It also may be sent only when requested (polled) by a central control function within the RFSS or dispatch console.

10.10.5

Portable Subscriber Unit Location

The portable SUs [G2] (handhelds) will not have MDC connectivity but will have the ability to report location information using an integral GPS device. Data from the portables is functionally identical to that from the mobiles (i.e., 9.6kbps, IP). The GPSequipped portable SUs will provide the same kind of position reporting functionality as the automatic vehicle location for the mobile SUs. This will allow tracking of dismounted personnel. GPS data will be transferred to the CAD system via the E-LMR network.

10.10.6

E-LMR RF Coverage Off-Installation

E-LMR users may want to dynamically, temporarily expand their existing radio coverage area to geographical areas not normally covered by repeater sites. Obvious reasons for doing so include military crash rescue personnel responding to an aircraft crash offinstallation or DoD firefighters responding to a mass-casualty terrorist incident in an adjacent city. This extension of E-LMR coverage is referred to as beyond line-of-sight or BLOS (this refers to functional, radio line-of-sight, not strict visual line-of-sight). Such BLOS functionality will be addressed by future PORs.

10.10.7

P25 Common Air Interface

Compliance with the P25 CAI standard allows radios from different manufacturers to interoperate over the air. This means that a mobile radio produced by vendor X can connect to a repeater produced by vendor Y and communicate with a portable radio made by vendor Z. This presents the opportunity to program SUs from other mutual aid and DoD entities to work on the E-LMR system. This pre-supposes that all the ancillary functionality (e.g.,
UNCLASSIFIED - FOUO 49

E-LMR System Design Specification

NSWC-CORDIV-FT31-SDS-20110601-001 v1.30

encryption, channel bandwidth, operating frequency) is compatible with the E-LMR infrastructure. More importantly, dedicated repeater assets [H2] can be allocated mutually agreed interoperable frequencies within 136-174 MHz, 450-512 870 MHz. These repeaters can be integrated with the 380-420 infrastructure to support mutual aid response within the USMC coverage installation emergency management personnel responding to a major incident.) to NIMS and MHz and 764MHz E-LMR area (e.g., offon-installation

10.10.8

Inter-RF Subsystem Interface

The ISSI [F3] provides a P25 compliant interface for other ISSI capable RFSSs. The ISSI permits multiple RFSSs to be interconnected together into wide-area networks. This allows the E-LMR P25 infrastructure to interface with other DoD and non-DoD infrastructures to expand the service area if desired. Although a P25 SU may operate freely only among systems with the standard P25 CAI, the P25 ISSI has the potential to connect between different radio or telecommunications networks (as long as they also support the ISSI) and with legacy DoD LMR systems and non-DoD mutual aid First Responder organizations.

10.10.9

Baseband Audio Cross-connect

An over-the-air interoperability solution is offered by a baseband cross-connect device [H2] that connects two or more different radio systems (one of which is E-LMR [Slice]). This is a stand-alone functionality that can be implemented at any number of locations. This normally would be implemented at an E-LMR repeater site that has line-of-sight connectivity to one or more interoperability partner off-installation systems. Traditionally this has been implemented with an audio bridge that provides connection between multiple E-LMR SUs (mobiles) and multiple mutual aid SUs. Interconnection is done with audio baseband and key signals so the impact of differences in operational frequency band, encryption, and talk group assignments are minimized. This creates a literal air gap between the two systems. At a system level, access to the E-LMR infrastructure for the USMC E-LMR user and the interoperability partner, will be essentially identical in function. That is, the mutual aid system (other radio operators, dispatchers, repeaters) will "see" the interoperability radio exactly as it would any of their other SUs in the field.

10.10.10

Computer-Aided Dispatch and E9-1-1

CAD and E9-1-1 systems are not directly in the domain of a P25 trunked radio system. They are, however, a vital part of the First Responder functionality as implemented in PSAPs.

10.10.11

Base Telephone Switch Interface

9-1-1 calls commonly are received through several means on DoD facilities. They can arrive through cell sites [B5], through off-installation [C3] or commercially switched phones [C4] or they can arrive from on-installation extensions [D3]. It is the job of the base phone switch (PBX) [D4] to route these calls to the 9-1-1 call taker. Most USMC installations use a Nortel SL-100 phone switch but the concept is the same, regardless of the switch. The call is routed to a digital phone instrument [E7] located at the call taker's position.

10.10.12

Automatic Number Identification/Location Information

ANI/ALI for the 9-1-1 call is derived differently depending on how the call arrived at the 9-1-1 center. If it was an on-installation call (from an extension connected directly to the SL-100), a local database [D4] is consulted by accessing information on the telephone management system (TMS) network [D4]. If it was an off-installation call, off-installation databases [B4] are consulted for the ANI/ALI. This information is processed by ANI/ALI servers [D7] and [C7] for presentation to the call taker on the E9-1-1 display.

10.10.13

CAD and E9-1-1 Call Taker Interface

Information regarding the call is displayed on the monitor [G7] in the dispatch position. This display not only presents ANI/ALI but also allows the call taker to place the call on hold, transfer the call to another operator or bridge in external parties (such as a poison control center or doctor). This display is driven by a "CAD/E9-1-1 subsystem" [F7], which provides graphical information and also handles the audio interface to the phone lines. The operator uses the same wireless headset used for radio dispatch. Keyboard and mouse functions are switched through a keyboard video monitor (KVM). A CAD server [C6] is used for the CAD function at the operator positions. This function is primarily associated with secure access to external criminal database records (e.g., checks for wants and warrants) for both the dispatch operators and the MDC operators in vehicles. CAD also supports the legal/record keeping function by recording a timestamped log of the handling of the incident and by allowing the dispatch operator to append a typed narrative of the incident during the call while it is still fresh in the operator's mind.

10.10.14

Geographical Information System

An interface to the USMC GeoFidelis geographical information system (GIS) will be provided for the dispatch operators. This display [G7] will give the dispatcher access to detailed map and graphics information about the installation as well as any particular incident area. Ideally this will consist of a broad scope of information including onUNCLASSIFIED - FOUO 51

installation and off-installation roads; building locations; building floor plans; heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC); electrical layouts; and other information a First Responder might need to effectively deal with an emergency. The GeoFidelis database [H8] will be accessed via the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) using standard NMCI leased assets. It is intended that these local NMCI assets (e.g. local PC [F7]) will be electrically separated from any other network.

The RFSS shall use those electrical interface standards and protocols identified in Section 9 dealing with system interfaces. 12.1.1.2 Wide Area Communications Network

All RFSS communications between RF repeater sites and between other RFSSs shall take place over a Government-provided WACN comprised of two separate networks: (a) BTI Net and (b) a U.S. Navy-managed Public Safety Net (PSNet). Access to PSNet shall be at designated service delivery points (SDPs) established at each installation. All information transported over these networks, prior to leaving the applicable controlled space (e.g., each equipment shelter, each secure space that houses RFSS equipment or ESs), shall be encrypted using AES-encrypted VPN tunnels. The design shall characterize thoroughly and accurately the bandwidth and QoS factor requirements that apply for communications between all RFSSs, NLRs, RF repeater suites and ESs to function properly and how they operate within the parameters stipulated in Section 9 of this document.

any prohibitions or restrictions to the services, features and capabilities identified in the P25 SOR. 12.1.1.3.2 Common Air Interface

The E-LMR RFSS and RF repeater suites (including associated antennas) shall enable CAI interoperability with all P25-compliant SUs within like frequency bands of operation for voice and data calls in trunked and conventional modes, whether encrypted or nonencrypted. This is required for Phase 1 and Phase 2 implementations. 12.1.1.3.3 Baseband Audio Bridge

The E-LMR RFSS shall be provided with baseband audio bridging units to enable communication with radio networks that are not P25 compatible. Each baseband audio bridge shall connect with the P25 infrastructure via an IP connection to the E-LMR WACN and bridge transmit/receive audio pairs, push-to-talk (PTT) control and a "trunked channel request" signal to Government-furnished equipment (GFE) radios. The baseband audio bridging units and their interface to the E-LMR system shall allow the E-LMR system to always be able to force an immediate PTT condition on any bridged communications system, regardless of whether that system is passing receive audio to the E-LMR system or not. Audio interfaces shall be 600 ohms balanced to ground with a peak audio power requirement of 0 dBm. The PTT interface shall be a contact closure referenced to ground, which when closed, requests PTT on the non-E-LMR connection. A "trunked channel request" input shall be generated, which shall initiate a request for the designated pre-programmed trunked channel on the E-LMR system upon activation. The bridging interface shall buffer audio from the non-E-LMR system until the designated trunked channel is granted. Minimum buffer size shall be one second. If the buffer is overflowed, when the non-E-LMR connection releases the "trunked channel request" signal, the bridging interface shall signal the non-E-LMR system that audio was lost by activating the PTT connection and sending a unique momentary tone or other audible indication to the non-E-LMR system. The design shall identify all features and capabilities that are provided by this particular implementation of the baseband audio bridge (and include a list of radios that the baseband audio bridge is capable of remotely controlling) as well as any prohibitions or restrictions to the services, features and capabilities identified in the P25 SOR. Any remote control shall be managed using a software client application running on a standalone workstation (or NMS-integrated applications software package) that is connected to the E-LMR WACN. 12.1.1.3.4 Telephone Interconnect

13.1.3

Subscriber Units

SUs consist of the following: (a) portables, (b) mobiles and (c) base stations. Limits on the size and weight for these units are outside the scope of this SDS due to the COTS nature of the equipment involved. The specific make and model of SUs has already been characterized.

13.2 Reliability, Maintainability and Availability
The E-LMR system design shall support reliability, maintainability and availability (RMA) by including the capability for: (a) remote monitor and control (RM&C) of each equipment space in which E-LMR equipment is installed; (b) verification of E-LMR system operational availability, including the ability to distinguish between failures involving E-LMR equipment installed in an equipment space and the Governmentprovided physical site infrastructure and data transport between equipment space demarcation points; and (c) incorporating technology refresh, insertion and modernization (TRIM).

13.2.1

RM&C

The monitor portion of RM&C shall include the ability to remotely monitor: (a) two interior ceiling-mounted motion sensors; (b) one entry-door switch contact for each door; (c) two ceiling-mounted smoke detectors that are UL-listed in accordance with UL 217; (d) one ceiling-mounted carbon-monoxide detector that is UL-listed in accordance with UL 2034; (e) one ceiling-mounted carbon-dioxide detector that is UL-listed in accordance with UL 1484; (f) all HVAC alarms; (g) all remotely accessible automatic transfer switch (ATS) alarms and monitored values; (h) all remotely accessible UPS alarms and monitored values; (i) equipment space temperature and humidity; and (j) 16 spare contact inputs. The monitoring capability shall provide locally adjustable audible alert and reset capability, be remotely accessible and controllable (including resetting of each sensor alarm) using an Ethernet/IP interface port and be integrated into NMS ES. The control portion of RM&C shall include the ability to remotely control: (a) all remotely controllable UPS functions, (b) all remotely controllable ATS functions and (c) all remotely controllable power distribution units. The control capability shall be remotely accessible and controllable using an Ethernet/IP interface port and integrated into the NMS ES.

13.2.2

Verify Ao

The E-LMR system design shall include the capability of verifying the E-LMR system Ao. This capability shall autonomously and continuously (on a periodic basis) access equipment performance and operational status data from all E-LMR local area network, RFSS, ES, NLR and RF repeater suites and determine the system Ao. The design shall provide the means by which the network administrator can identify the exact equipment complement (from among the total set of E-LMR equipment) and interval periods for
UNCLASSIFIED - FOUO 79

E-LMR System Design Specification

NSWC-CORDIV-FT31-SDS-20110601-001 v1.30

capturing data and determining the Ao. The design shall result in monitoring equipment and software that: (a) does not interfere or degrade E-LMR performance in accordance with this SDS and (b) can distinguish between failures involving E-LMR equipment installed in an equipment space and the Government-provided physical site infrastructure and data transport between equipment space demarcation points.

13.2.3

Technology Refresh, Insertion and Modernization

The E-LMR system design shall incorporate provisions for the following TRIM changes that can occur at any time during the expected life of the system: (a) technology refresh, (b) technology insertion and (c) technology modernization. 13.2.3.1 Technology Refresh

Technology refresh is a change that incorporates a new product or component due to product end of life or obsolescence and includes re-certification or certification as required. An example of this is the replacement of one make and model of site RF repeater with another of equal capability. In this case, the previous site RF repeater has been discontinued for sale, manufacture or availability of service or parts. The new site RF repeater is beginning its product life cycle and may include new features (e.g., more complete RM&C) that do not result in an operational system capability improvement. 13.2.3.2 Technology Insertion

Technology insertion is a change that incorporates a new capability using a form, fit and function compatible product resulting from industry or DoD development and includes re-certification or certification as required. An example of this is the replacement of one vocoder with another that has improved cancellation of ambient noise. In this case, the new vocoder is likely to be implemented as a software only change (although this is not generally required), the new vocoder is completely compatible over the CAI with all preceding P25 vocoders and the replacement vocoder results in a new operational system capability (i.e., the ability to maintain effective communications in higher ambient noise environments). 13.2.3.3 Technology Modernization

Technology modernization is a change that incorporates a new capability using the next generation product or upgrade that may or may not be form, fit and function compatible and includes re-certification or certification as required. An example of this is the upgrade of the E-LMR system from Phase 1 FDMA to Phase 2 TDMA. In the case of this SDS, the system design shall be capable of this change using a software-only upgrade (although this is generally not required for this type of change). In this case, the next generation product results in a new operational system capability (i.e., the ability to support two trunked group voice calls using the same spectrum bandwidth previously required for one).

19 Manpower, Personnel and Training
A Manpower, Personnel and Training Analysis (MP&TA) is being conducted for the E-LMR program. However, it is anticipated that no change in Marine Corps Tables of Organization, to include phasing out or creating new billets, will be required as a result of E-LMR fielding. Nonetheless, the MP&TA will identify the manpower requirements to adequately staff the E-LMR system. The concept of support is contractor logistics support (CLS), government employees or Marines using existing Table of Organization structure. Training aids will be provided to educate First Responders and dispatchers on the proper use of E-LMR SUs. The system design for all interfaces and training materials, including imbedded training capability, shall be optimized for the transfer of knowledge.

20 System Quality Factors
EMC2 CERS and E-LMR POR acquisitions are designated ACAT IV(M) and approved for entry into the DoD 5000 model just prior to milestone (MS) C. This acquisition approach leads to the use of a modified and tailored test strategy referred to as "dT&E" due to the COTS/non-developmental item (NDI) nature of EMC2 solutions. The lower case "d" refers to customized developmental test (DT) events, defined in the USMC T&E Handbook11, that are appropriate for COTS and NDI systems. Figure 6 depicts the integrated EMC2 system engineering technical review and test and evaluation (T&E) process integrated with key acquisition events and organized in accordance with the system engineering process. This approach will ensure that delivered EMC2 systems are: (a) verified as meeting technical performance parameters and (b) validated as providing capabilities suitable to successfully accomplish the EMC2 mission. EMC2 test events include: a) Functional Verification Test12 (FVT): conducted on one article while leveraging GFI, GFE and or associate contractor agreements (ACAs) to provide other EMC2 system test articles (E9-1-1 and CERS) to ensure standalone functionality and system to system interoperability. b) Product Acceptance Test13 (PAT): conducted to finalize the production baseline prior to field installation. c) System Qualification Test14 (SQT): conducted twice prior to System Verification Review (SVR) and subsequently at each installation to ensure the installed system is acceptable. d) Field User Evaluation15 (FUE): conducted as an operationally focused test for ACAT IV(M) PORs. This test will be scenario driven to ensure ERS mission success at each installation after all EMC2 systems have been installed. Table 5 summarizes the major T&E parameters of each test in terms of resources, locations, personnel, interfaces and cost. Table 6 lists the measures of success. Details for identified success metrics and associated measures of performance are detailed in the EMC2 TEMP.

24 Logistics Related Requirements 24.1 Support Concept
The E-LMR system will use COTS items to the maximum extent possible and refer to MCO 4105.2 and other appropriate maintenance orders to develop its support concept. An appropriately tailored logistics support analysis (LSA) considering performancebased logistics (PBL) with CLS and organic support will be initiated. The Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) plan will describe the logistics support concepts in accordance with DoDI 5000.2 series and SECNAVINST 5000.2 series. Equipment standardization, configuration control and supportability are the primary logistics considerations. Support considerations shall be integrated into the system design, schedule, cost and acquisition plan. Logistics support shall be coordinated using existing USMC support infrastructure and commercial sources. MOAs will be established between USMC organizations and any external agencies regarding the logistics support required. Logistic support considerations will include: equipment maintenance (preventive and corrective), primary power, refueling, generators, batteries and personnel. A thorough set of system logistics support data in digital format will be included in the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) portion of the solicitation. Funding requirements for the maintenance and support of E-LMR will be identified in the Logistics Requirements and Funding Summary (LRFS). The USMC Depot Level Source of Repair (DLSOR) policy17 describes the USMC process for evaluating, selecting and obtaining a Depot Source of Repair decision. The E-LMR DLSOR recommendation for hardware is COTS (OEMs). The E-LMR maintenance approach for hardware in the operational environment is built upon the use of warranty support as detailed in the E-LMR Fielding Plan. The E-LMR program office will develop and budget for a five-year hardware tech refresh program to maintain system readiness and maintain eligible for full support and benefits provided by the E-LMR warranty program. Title 10 U.S.C. 2464 and DoD policy require organic core maintenance capabilities. Such capabilities provide effective and timely response to surge demands, ensure competitive capabilities and sustain institutional expertise. The PdM should document the support approach that is within statutory limitations and the application of support concepts for new and modified systems to maximize the use of contractor-provided, long-term, total life-cycle logistics support that combines depot-level maintenance for non-core-related workload along with wholesale and selected retail materiel

management functions. Maximizing the use of contractor provided support is not a mandate, merely a suggestion for consideration.

24.1.1

Hardware Support Concept

The E-LMR OEM will perform depot-level maintenance on items that fail and are beyond repair at the operator level.

24.1.2

Software Support Concept

E-LMR system software is installed by the OEM as part of the system. As such the OEM will be the sole source of repair for all Software support.

24.2 Supply
All supply support will be provided by the OEM until the warranty expires. Installations will be responsible for establishing their maintenance contracts or assume the maintenance responsibility at that time. If the initial issue provisioning (IIP) does not go through MARCORLOGCOM, the PdM must provide the installation with a provisioning letter, which identifies all provisioned items, provides NSN or part number, and provides quantity by unit. This also applies to a CLS contract. PBL offers programs the best strategic approach for delivering required life cycle readiness, reliability, and ownership costs.

25 Risk Areas
The following risks to the E-LMR program were extracted from the quarterly Program Management Review (PMR) and Information Technology Steering Group (ITSG) briefs.

25.1 Programmatic Funding
A lack of sufficient programmatic funding will result in not meeting the objectives set in Marine Corps Requirements Oversight Council (MROC) Decision Memoranda (DMs) 20- and 40-2010. Furthermore, legacy solutions will deteriorate and generate unpredictable sustainment costs. Events and Mitigation Steps: Initial program funds have been secured for FY12 based on the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) 12 submission. The E-LMR system will use EMC2/Stakeholder Advocacy to influence POM for out years. Thus, the E-LMR system will compete in the POM process for FY13 and beyond.

25.2 Technology Obsolescence
The APCO P25 standard upon which the USMC E-LMR system is designed is planned to be an effective First Responder communications technology for a period of time that exceeds the expected life of the initial material solution. Events and Mitigation Steps: This design requires that the initial Phase 1 system be capable of upgrading to P25 Phase 2 via software modifications. Further, the contract will require the contractor to incorporate all future P25 standards capabilities within 18 months of the publication of remaining P25 standards.

25.3 Construction
E-LMR tower/shelter construction requires Military Construction (MILCON) if costs exceed $750K per RF repeater site project. A requirement for MILCON funding will result in a three to five year delay due to the extensive process involved with obtaining construction funding. Events and Mitigation Steps: Review AoA survey tower data to determine E-LMR tower/shelter construction. Work closely with Installation and Logistics (I&L) to identify what comprises tower/shelter construction. Have documentation ready to execute any MILCON costs that exceed $750K per tower project.

25.4 Emergency Response and Safety
Not filling this capability gap creates several issues for the USMC, including the inability to effectively respond to an emergency on an installation that endangers Marines, their families and First Responders.

UNCLASSIFIED - FOUO

105

E-LMR System Design Specification

NSWC-CORDIV-FT31-SDS-20110601-001 v1.30

Events and Mitigation Steps: Use the AoA survey data to identify E-LMR capability gaps at each installation. Use the acquisition framework process to reach MS C and begin the procurement of E-LMR equipment.

25.5 Operational Risk Areas
The greatest operational risk is twofold: (a) establishment and maintenance of the required MOAs with mutual support partners at all levels of government and NGOs and (b) access to and maintenance of the required unencumbered spectrum within the 380400 MHz frequency band to effectively operate a multi-site FDMA Phase 1 or TDMA Phase 2 P25 LMR system at each USMC installation. Events and Mitigation Steps: With regard to MOAs, Marine Corps Installations regional commands will determine the operational and technical criteria necessary for proper LMR operations with their mutual support partners and successfully negotiate an MOA with each governmental agency or NGO in question. The MOA will satisfy the requirements in the most current edition of the NTIA manual. Regarding unencumbered spectrum, the design includes site RF repeaters capable of operating in conformance with DoD and FCC requirements in all possible VHF and UHF frequency bands. Further, the regional commands will ensure that the proper EMC and RF analysis tools are used to perform all EMC analyses required for trouble free operation.

25.6 Risk Management
Programmatic risk management is addressed by the plans, procedures and milestones contained in the E-LMR Risk Management Plan.

25.7 Technology Risks
Technology risk management is addressed by the plans, procedures and objectives contained in the EMC2 SEP and the technology obsolescence mitigation measures previously identified.

26 Cost Analysis
The following cost analysis areas are applicable to E-LMR.

26.1 Probabilistic Determinations of Cost
Probabilistic determination of costs for E-LMR was made in accordance with the AC PROG E-LMR AoA and life cycle cost estimate (LCCE).

26.2 Tradeoff Priorities
Tradeoff priorities for E-LMR were made in accordance with the AC PROG AoA.

26.3 CAIV Philosophy
Cost as an independent variable (CAIV) is an acquisition management discipline wherein cost goals (constraints) are achieved through tradeoffs between requirements and performance. Within DoD, CAIV applies to all programs and is intended to assure an affordable program and reduce program total ownership cost. E-LMR program CAIV objectives have been addressed by actions in the requirements, design and contracting areas.  Requirements: o Ensuring a user-focused CPD process for establishing capability requirements. o Including requirements at the threshold and objective levels.  Design: o Inclusion of a requirement for the system to be upgradable to P25 Phase 2 using software-only modifications. o Inclusion of a requirement for the system to be designed from the outset with the capability to maintain all system level certifications over the expected life of the system.  Contracting: o Use of a "best value" award criteria. o Inclusion of an option for transition to USMC organic support for SUs after the initial warranty period.

26.4 `Fenced' Areas
There are no fenced areas for the E-LMR system.

26.5 Lifecycle vs. Acquisition Cost Priorities
These priorities were made in accordance with the AC PROG E-LMR AoA, LCCE, AS/AP and MROC priority matrix.

26.6 Acquisition Strategy Options
 DoD Instruction 5000.02: Establishes a simplified and flexible management framework for translating capability needs and technology opportunities, based on approved capability needs, into stable, affordable and well-managed acquisition programs that include weapon systems, services and automated information systems (AISs). This is the governing acquisition guidance the E-LMR program will be using throughout its lifecycle. SECNAVINST 5000.2: The E-LMR program uses this instruction, in concert with DoDI 5000.02, to comply with the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) policies and procedures of identifying, assessing and prioritizing joint military capability needs, as directed by the Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration. DoDI 8580.1: The E-LMR program uses this instruction as guidance in describing the recommended levels of IA activities relative to the acquisition of systems and services. Its primary purpose is to prescribe procedures necessary to integrate IA into the E-LMR acquisition plan as described in DoD Instruction 5000.02. The official options for this program are delineated in the E-LMR AS/AP.

The primary purpose of the OV-2 is to define capability requirements within an operational context. The OV-2 may also be used to express a capability boundary. The OV-2 can be used to show flows of funding, personnel and materiel in addition to information. A specific application of the OV-2 is to describe a logical pattern of resource (information, funding, personnel, or materiel) flows. The logical pattern need not correspond to specific organizations, systems or locations, allowing Resource Flows to be established without prescribing the way that the Resource Flows are handled and without prescribing solutions.

E-LMR (Slice) Operational Resource Flow Matrix (OV-3) The OV-3 identifies the resource transfers that are necessary to support operations to achieve a specific operational task. This model is initially constructed from the information contained in the OV-2 Operational Resource Flow Description model. But the OV-3 provides a more detailed definition of the Resource Flows for operations within a community of anticipated users. The Operational Resource Flow Matrix details Resource Flow exchanges by identifying which Operational Activity and locations exchange what resources, with whom, why the resource is necessary, and the key attributes of the associated resources. The OV-3 identifies resource elements and relevant attributes of the Resource Flows and associates the exchange to the producing and consuming Operational Activities and locations and to the Needline that the Resource Flow satisfies. OV-3 is one of a suite of operational models that address the resource content of the operational architecture (the others being OV-2 Operational Resource Flow Description, OV-5b Operational Activity Model, and DIV-2 Logical Data Model). Needlines are logical requirements-based collaboration relationships between Operational Activities and locations (as shown in OV-2 Operational Resource Flow Description). A Needline can be unidirectional. Please double-click the icon to view Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet E-LMR (Slice) Organizational Relationships Chart (OV-4) The OV-4 shows organizational structures and interactions. The organizations shown may be civil or military. The OV-4 exists in two forms; role-based (e.g., a typical brigade command structure) and actual (e.g., an organization chart for a department or agency). A role-based OV-4 shows the possible relationships between organizational resources. The key relationship is composition, i.e., one organizational resource being part of a parent organization. In addition to this, the architect may show the roles each organizational resource has, and the interactions between those roles, i.e., the roles represent the functional aspects of organizational resources. There are no prescribed resource interactions in DoDAF V2.0: the architect should select an appropriate interaction type from the DM2 or add a new one. Interactions illustrate the fundamental roles and management responsibilities, such as supervisory reporting, Command and Control (C2) relationships, collaboration and so on. An actual OV-4 shows the structure of a real organization at a particular point in time, and is used to provide context to other parts of the architecture such as AV-1 and the CVs.

E-LMR (Slice) Event-Trace Description (OV-6c) OV-6c describes Operational Activity or business process responses to sequences of events. Events may also be referred to as inputs, transactions, or triggers. Events can be internally or externally generated and can include such things as the receipt of a message, a timer going off, or conditional tests being satisfied. The OV-6c Event-Trace description provides a time-ordered examination of the information exchanges between participating operational nodes necessary to successfully manage and extend non-tactical LAN mobile radio communications. While several scenarios could depict various information exchanges, this scenario is meant to trigger as many operational nodes as possible using the E-LMR (Slice) system in response to an accidental mishap on installation, resulting in mass casualties that necessitates First Responder assistance.

E-LMR (Slice) System Viewpoints (SV) E-LMR (Slice) Systems Interface Description (SV-1) An SV-1 can be used simply to depict Systems and sub-systems and identify the Resource Flows between them. The real benefit of a SV-1 is its ability to show the human aspects of an architecture, and how these interact with Systems. A primary purpose of a SV-1 DoDAF-described Model is to show resource structure, i.e., identify the primary sub-systems, performer and activities (functions) and their interactions. SV-1 contributes to user understanding of the structural characteristics of the capability. This SV-1 describes the need for two nodes to exchange system information, but not the path that information will take. Because of the different types of capabilities available through E-LMR (Slice), this viewpoint does not have an exact correlation to the OV-2. The chart on the left of the SV-1 shows the system-supporting relationships back to the OV-2. For example, the Mobile and Portable Subscriber Units could support both the Installation Fire and the Installation Law Enforcement performers, but not the Dispatch performer. The "Fixed" station markers in the Installation Fire and Installation Law rows are meant to depict a Firehouse or Police Station fixed subscriber unit. The center node, "External Infrastructure" represents the need for external network and PSTN support that is required to bring these capabilities to bear. The external network component shall be comprised of an IP management network providing service and management to the E-LMR (Slice) system. The type and scope of this infrastructure is beyond the scope of this architecture.

E-LMR (Slice) Systems Resource Flow Description (SV-2) A SV-2 DoDAF-described Model is used to give a precise specification of a connection between Systems. This may be an existing connection, or a specification for a connection that is to be made. A SV-2 may be comprised of Systems, their ports, and the Resource Flows between those ports. This SV-2 depicts a high level communications view of E-LMR (Slice). Because of the different types of capabilities available through E-LMR (Slice), this viewpoint does not have an exact correlation to the OV-2. The chart on the right of the diagram shows the system-supporting relationship back to the OV-2. For example, the Mobile and Portable Subscriber Units could support both the Installation Fire and the Installation Law Enforcement performers, but not the Dispatch performer. The "Fixed" station markers in the Installation Fire and Installation Law rows are meant to depict a Firehouse or Police Station fixed subscriber unit. This SV-2 shows some duplicate interfaces that are intended to represent additional capability, not redundant communications paths. System Interfaces 06 and 07 both show an APCO P25 compliant interface and an UTP-type interface between the Fixed Subscriber Unit and the Repeater Station. This is meant to show a requirement for both capabilities, not that both capabilities need to be employed in every instance of this arrangement. Similarly, SI-18 shows an interface that may exist between the Fixed Station Console (FS CON ES) and a CAD, but not that it must exist.

The SV-3 provides a tabular summary of the system interactions specified in the SV-1 Systems Interface Description model for the Architectural Description. The matrix format supports a rapid assessment of potential Please double-click the icon to view Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet E-LMR (Slice) Systems Functionality Description: Taxonomic Functional Hierarchy (SV-4) The SV-4 is used to specify the functionality of resources in the architecture (in this case, functional resources, systems, performer and capabilities). The SV-4 is the behavioral counterpart to the SV-1 Systems Interface Description (in the same way that OV-5b Operational Activity Model is the behavioral counterpart to OV-2 Operational Resource Flow Matrix). The Taxonomic Functional Hierarchy shows a decomposition of functions depicted in a tree structure and is typically used where tasks are concurrent but dependent, such as a production line, for example. The functions are likely to be related to Operational Activities captured in OV-5a. Although there is a correlation between the Operational Activity Model (OV-5b) and the functional hierarchy of SV-4, it need not be a one-to-one mapping, hence, the need for the Function to Operational Activity Traceability Matrix (SV-5), which provides that mapping. This SV-4 describes the high level functions of the E-LMR (SLICE) system as depicted with regard to the JCSFL v3.0 structure.

E-LMR (Slice) Systems Functionality Description: Data Flow Diagram (SV-4) The SV-4 is used to specify the functionality of resources in the architecture (in this case, functional resources, systems, performer and capabilities). The SV-4 is the behavioral counterpart to the SV-1 Systems Interface Description (in the same way that OV-5b Operational Activity Model is the behavioral counterpart to OV-2 Operational Resource Flow Matrix). The Data Flow Diagram shows functions connected by data flow arrows and data stores. Within an Architectural Description, the SV-4 documents system functions, the Resource Flows between those functions, the internal system data repositories or system data stores, and the external producers and consumers for the system data flows, but not those external to the Architectural Description scope. These SV-4s describe the high level functionality of the E-LMR (SLICE) system. The first of the data flow SV-4's describe the system functions as they apply to the requirements to establish network responsibilities and encryption protocols. The GUI interface represents the way the user would input information into either the Network Management or the Encryption Management systems, and how those systems would move and store the relevant data. The second data flow SV-4 describes the E-LMR (SLICE) system as it applies to the functions required to establish a communications connection and pass different types of information. The system functions and data storages devices represented on these pages could be contained and utilized across the set of E-LMR (SLICE) sub-systems. For example, an instance of the Talkgroup Data Storage data store would exist within every subscriber unit, as well as within the RFSS. E-LMR (SLICE) has the ability to encrypt communications using the Type 3 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. This makes the system components non-Controlled Cryptographic Items (nonCCI), and they are not subject to the protections and controls afforded to military grade COMSEC equipment. In the scope of this architecture the words encrypt, decrypt, Over the Air Rekey (OTAR) and other cryptographic terms are used in reference to Type 3 AES encryption, and nothing higher.

E-LMR (Slice) Operational Activity to Systems Function Traceability Matrix (SV-5a) The SV-5a addresses the linkage between System Functions described in SV-4 Systems Functionality Description and Operational Activities specified in OV-5a Operational Activity Decomposition Tree or OV-5b Operational Activity Model. The SV-5a identifies the transformation of an operational need into a purposeful action performed by a system or solution. The relationship between operational activities and system functions can also be expected to be many-to-many (i.e., one activity may be supported by multiple functions, and one function may support multiple activities). Please double-click the icon to view Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet E-LMR (Slice) System Resource Flow Matrix (SV-6) The SV-6 specifies the characteristics of Resource Flow exchanges between systems. The SV-6 is the physical equivalent of the logical OV-3 table and provides detailed information on the system connections which implement the Resource Flow exchanges specified in OV-3. Non-automated Resource Flow exchanges, such as verbal orders, are also captured. System Resource Flow exchanges express the relationship across the three basic architectural data elements of a SV (systems, system functions, and system Resource Flows) and focus on the specific aspects of the System Resource Flow and the system resource content. These aspects of the System Resource Flow exchange can be crucial to the operational mission and are critical to understanding the potential for overhead and constraints introduced by the physical aspects of the implementation such as security policy and communications limitations. The focus of SV-6 is on how the System Resource Flow exchange is affected, in system-specific details covering periodicity, timeliness, throughput, size, information assurance, and security characteristics of the resource exchange. In addition, the System Resource Flow elements, their format and media type, accuracy, units of measurement, and system data standard are also described in the matrix. Please double-click the icon to view Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet E-LMR (Slice) Systems Event Trace Description (SV-10c) (For Exposition Only) The SV-10c provides a time-ordered examination of the interactions between functional resources. The SV-10c is valuable for moving to the next level of detail from the initial solution design, to help define a sequence of functions and system data interfaces, and to ensure that each participating resource has the necessary information it needs, at the right time, to perform its assigned functionality. The SV-10c is not a required viewpoint for this architecture, but it helps to clarify the sequence of system functions and system data exchanges required for E-LMR (Slice) to perform. This SV-10c describes the time-ordered system data exchanges necessary to initiate a voice communication. For the purposes of this diagram, it is assumed that the subscriber units have the required key and talkgroup assignment to received the communication. The blue event blocks denote an set of required inputs for a desired output. For example, in order for event #1 to trigger its output, the "Decrypt Data" or "Encrypt Data" system functions must be able to recall the appropriate "Talkgroup Encryption Scheme" key from system memory. As mentioned earlier, E-LMR (SLICE) has the ability to encrypt communications using the Type 3 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. This makes the system components non-Controlled Cryptographic Items (non-CCI), and they are not subject to the protections and controls afforded to actual COMSEC equipment.

E-LMR System Design Specification

NSWC-CORDIV-FT31-SDS-20110601-001 v1.30

E-LMR (Slice) Technical Viewpoints (StdV) The StdV-1 defines the technical, operational, and business standards, guidance, and policy applicable to the architecture being described. As well as identifying applicable technical standards, the DoDAF V2.0 StdV-1 also documents the policies and standards that apply to the operational or business context. The DISR is an architecture resource for technical standards that can be used in the generation of the StdV-1 and StdV-2 Standards Viewpoints. In most cases, building a Standards Profile consists of identifying and listing the applicable portions of existing and emerging documentation. A StdV-1 should identify both existing guidelines, as well as any areas lacking guidance. The StdV-2 contains expected changes in technology related standards, operational standards, or business standards and conventions, which are documented in the StdV-1 model. A StdV-2 is a detailed description of emerging standards relevant to the systems, operational, and business activities covered by the architectural description. The forecast should be tailored to focus on areas that are related to the purpose for which a given Architectural Description is being built, and should identify issues that affect the architecture. A StdV-2 complements and expands on the StdV-1 Standards Profile model and should be used when more than one emerging standard time-period is applicable to the architecture. Many of the APCO P25 standards that will be mandated for this system are not currently registered in DISR Online, or are in need up of updating, and are not posted as of the completion of this architecture. The second document below lists those standards and the requested adjustments. Once approved and posted to DISR Online, the updated Standards View 1 and 2 (StdV-1/2) will be attached to this architecture.

Appendix B: Requirements Traceability Matrix
The RTM is used to maintain traceability between key requirements documents. In the case of EMC2, these consist of a SON, CPD and SDS for each POR. The RTM also provides a means of displaying the assessment of each requirement so traced. The E-LMR RTM was developed in accordance with a modified RTM format based on extracts from the basic requirements documents using IBM Rational Dynamic Object Oriented Requirements System (DOORS), a requirements management application software tool. Because the document is 300+ pages in length, the reader is referred to the actual E-LMR RTM for access to the complete content. Please double-click on icon to view the complete RTM document

To implement the E-LMR ERI system in accordance with (IAW) a cutover plan that incurs no disruption of existing services. To provide training on all E-LMR ERI systems. 19.0-1 A Manpower, Personnel and Training Analysis (MP&TA) is being conducted for the E-LMR program. However, it is anticipated that no change in Marine Corps Tables of Organization, to include phasing out or creating new billets, will be required as a result of E-LMR fielding. Nonetheless, the MP&TA will identify the manpower requirements to adequately staff the E-LMR system. The concept of support is contractor logistics support (CLS), government employees or Marines using existing Table of Organization structure. Training aids will be provided to educate First Responders and dispatchers on the proper use of E-LMR SUs. The system design for all interfaces and training materials, including imbedded training capability, shall be optimized for the transfer of knowledge. Civilian system administrators and maintainers will be required at the regional level. 23.0-1 The E-LMR system is comprised of COTS components and NDIs. An MP&TA is being conducted for E-LMR. The resulting Manpower and Training Plan will identify the training requirements and civilian manpower structure required for E-LMR. 23.0-2 Training will be provided to individual installation communication sections, repair/maintenance sections; and all First Responders and dispatchers. Each installation will be responsible for maintaining the training materials. Refresher training should be conducted periodically when required and locally funded. The OEM will provide all training to include new equipment and refresher.

To provide system warranty, software upgrades and support services for three (3) year with two (2) option years.

24.1.0-4 The USMC Depot Level Source of Repair (DLSOR) policy describes the USMC process for evaluating, selecting and obtaining a Depot Source of Repair decision. The E-LMR DLSOR recommendation for hardware is COTS (OEMs). The E-LMR maintenance approach for hardware in the operational environment is built upon the use of warranty support as detailed in the E-LMR Fielding Plan. The E-LMR program office will develop and budget for a five-year hardware tech refresh program to maintain system readiness and maintain eligible for full support and benefits provided by the E-LMR warranty program. 24.1.0-5 Title 10 U.S.C. 2464 and DoD policy require organic core maintenance capabilities. Such capabilities provide effective and timely response to surge demands, ensure competitive capabilities and sustain institutional expertise. The PdM should document the support approach that is within statutory limitations and the application of support concepts for new and modified systems to maximize the use of contractor-provided, long-term, total life-cycle logistics support that combines depot-level maintenance for non-core-related workload along with wholesale and selected retail materiel management functions. Maximizing the use of contractor provided support is not a mandate, merely a suggestion for consideration.

In regard to the intended E-LMR ERI Continuity of Operations requirement in the E-LMR SDS, the on-site maintenance from an enterprise, regional and local level shall be addressed. This includes not only Government and local support contractor maintenance activities but also activities performed by the equipment vendor and manufacturer. A discussion of required education, training and certification for the support personnel also shall be included. (h) Factory-level sustainment activities performed by the manufacturer or designated representative shall be included. This involves system component servicing, turnaround time, factory sparing and "swapping" procedures, training (both operator and maintainer) and other factory-level activities and procedures the contractor deems appropriate. (i) A plan for testing, accounting for and maintaining spares and caches (at any proposed organizational level) shall be explained. This shall include systemic level, quantity and refresh cycles for all spares and redundancy elements discussed in the plan. Addressed separately or within each part of the plan shall be an explanation of the paradigm for handling failed elements once they are removed from the system. (j) An explanation of warranty provisions and how these impact the sustainment plan. This shall include any prohibited actions or inactions that may void warranty provisions. This also shall include detailed coverage stipulations of the warranty. (k) A support equipment and test equipment plan. This shall include a list of recommended support equipment, staging and prepositioning for this equipment. Maintenance schedules for this test equipment also shall be detailed.

Purpose

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to ensure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of this performance-based service order. The intent is to verify that the contractor performs in accordance with (IAW) the performance metrics and that the Government receives services at the quality level called for in the contract.

This requirement addresses contractor services necessary for the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) Eastern Region Infrastructure (ERI) project effort under the cognizance of the United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager (PM) Information Systems and Infrastructure (IS&I) Product Manager (PdM), Emergency Response Systems (ERS). The resulting vehicle will be a performance-based, Firm Fixed Price contract. This contract will be for a base year with four option years. A properly executed QASP will assist the Government in achieving the objectives of this procurement.

The support services to be provided shall include: program management, systems engineering, system test and evaluation, training, site installation and activation, technical documentation, and sustainment. The plan is designed to limit surveillance to the necessary measures to verify the contractor is satisfactorily performing services directly related to the performance requirements of the E-LMR ERI Performance Work Statement (PWS).

Authority

Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E – Inspection and Acceptance, which provides for inspections and acceptance of the services and documentation called for in service contracts, to be executed by the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized representative. 

Scope

The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance and oversight of the contractor’s efforts to assure that they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the E-LMR ERI contract. As part of the QASP, the Government will provide an evaluation in the Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS) at the end of each year of performance. The contractor’s performance on this task order will be evaluated by the Government as described below.

The first evaluation will cover the surveillance period ending with the base period after date of contract award with successive evaluations being performed for each 12-month period thereafter until the contractor completes performance of all options (if awarded) under this contract. For the first surveillance period and each subsequent 12-month period, the Government will evaluate the contractor’s performance using the surveillance methods outlined in Section 6. The evaluation will encompass all work performed by the contractor at any time during the 12-month period but will not include cumulative information from prior reports. For each period, the contractor will complete a self-assessment of the performance provided, to be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and Contract Specialist no later than (NLT) 60 days prior to the end of the period of performance. The self-assessment shall cover all areas of the Government QASP. Based on the evaluation results, the Contracting Officer will assign an overall performance rating. If the Contracting Officer assigns an “Unsatisfactory” performance rating for the period evaluated, the next option period will not be exercised. 

Government Resources

The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan:

Contracting Officer: A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into contracts and make related determinations and findings on behalf of the Government. The contracting officer is identified in Section G of the contract. Contracting Officers are designated via a written warrant which sets forth limitations of authority.

Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR): An individual appointed in writing by the contracting officer to act as their authorized representative to assist in administering the contract. The COR will be designated in the resulting contract. The COR engages in Government surveillance of the contractor’s performance. The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or changes that will affect price, quality, quantity, delivery, or any other term or condition of the contract. The limitations of authority are contained in a written letter of designation.

Technical Point of Contact (TPOC): An individual designated by the COR to serve as the coordinator and lead technical Government representative for the 
E-LMR ERI activity efforts.

Contract Specialist: An individual assigned by the contracting officer to carry out the day to day contractual requirements of the delivery orders.

Responsibilities

The following Government resources shall have responsibility for the implementation of this QASP:  

Contracting Officer: The Contracting Officer ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the contractor receives impartial, fair and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor’s performance

Contracting Officer’s Representative: The COR is responsible for technical administration of the contract and assures proper Government surveillance of the contractor’s technical performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any changes on the Government’s behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect contract price, terms or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action.

Technical Point of Contact: The TPOC is responsible for the technical review and contract compliance by the contractor to individual task orders. The TPOC will be responsible for the following: definition of contract tasks and subtasks, review of requested delivery order work orders, and sourcing concurrence for delivery orders, and resume qualification review/approval for key positions. The TPOC is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any changes on the Government’s behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect contract price, terms or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action.

Contract Specialist: The Contract Specialist is a Level I, II or III certified individual assigned to assist in the daily administration of the contract. The specialist may also provide input to the contracting officer and the COR as to the quality of performance areas addressed in the QASP.

Methods of QA Surveillance

The COR will use the surveillance methods listed below in the administration of this QASP to determine whether the contractor is effectively and efficiently complying with all terms and conditions of the contract, PWS, System Design Specification (SDS) and Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). The Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) listed in Enclosure 1 contains the performance objectives that are being measured. In addition, the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form, provided as Enclosure 2, will be used to document the findings. 

Inspection: A method carried out by visual examination. 

Monthly: The COTR/COR shall review the generated documentation (e.g., meeting minutes, engineering reviews, data from testing, reports, or installation documentation) and enter summary results into the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form.

Ad hoc: The COTR/COR shall conduct ad hoc inspections as required and enter summary results into the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form.

Analysis: A method carried out by detailed examinations and or calculations on recorded, test or derived data associated with a deliverable to determine if applications and/or techniques are appropriate and effective. 

Demonstration: A method carried out by operation of the system, or part of the system, that relies on observable functional operation. 

Test: A method using instrumentation or calibrated test equipment to obtain performance data for subsequent analysis.

Customer Feedback: A method by which installation operators may submit feedback on the performance of the system.

Contractor Performance Assessment Report System: An evaluation using the CPARS format will be performed at the end of each year of performance. The Government will address the quality of product or service, schedule, cost control, business relations and management, as this information may affect future source selections throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) and the continuation of the order. The annual Government assessment will be used appropriately as an additional performance oversight and communication tool with the QASP.

Documentation

In addition to providing quarterly reports to the Contracting Officer, the COR will maintain a complete Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions related to the Government’s performance of the quality assurance function. All such records will be maintained for the life of the contract. The COR shall forward these records to the Contracting Officer at termination or completion of the contract.

The table below sets forth the performance ratings and standards the Government shall use to grade contractor performance. The Government will evaluate the contractor’s performance of the PWS for each task order, and the Contracting Officer will assign one of the following ratings:

(1) Excellent

(2) Satisfactory

(3) Unsatisfactory

The standards associated with these ratings are given in Table 1. The ratings shall be provided to the Contracting Officer at the end of each surveillance period.

Table 1 Overall Performance Ratings



The Contracting Officer will make a performance determination for each task order at the end of each evaluation period. The determination will be based upon the COR’s recommendations, the contractor’s comments including any Self-Evaluation Report and any other information deemed relevant by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall resolve disagreements between the COR’s recommendations and the contractor’s comments/reports regarding the evaluation. The Contracting Officer’s performance evaluation is unilateral and final. The Contracting Officer will document the determination and provide a copy to the contractor within 30 days of receipt of the contractor’s self-assessment.

BuyAccessible Government Product / Service Accessibility Template (GPAT)
Section 508 (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=policies)requires that federal agencies electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=1998Amend) are determined as applicable to this acquisition based on the following technical provisions: To understand the technical standards that apply to each provision, the respondent should refer to http://Section 508.gov at http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsdoc. This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements. NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information. The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively. Please fill the information below as a part of request for accessibility information of your proposed deliverable.

Executive Summary
The Marine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Lejeune, North Carolina (NC), and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, NC, Site Survey was conducted from 30 August ­ 02 September 2010. Representatives from Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center-Atlantic (SSC-LANT) met with the Marine Corps Installations (MCI) East and MCB Camp Lejeune / MCAS New River personnel. The Site Survey Team's goal was to capture the "as-is" baseline of the current Emergency Response System (ERS), consisting of Land Mobile Radio (LMR) and Consolidated Emergency Response System (CERS). The installation representatives candidly discussed their systems, infrastructure, organization, and technological capabilities and limitations. The MCB Camp Lejeune/MCAS New River has a legacy LMR. The legacy LMR network is a Motorola SmartNet II, trunked, analog, wideband system consisting of ten repeaters operating in the 406 ­ 420 Megahertz (MHz) range. The system has one site controller and an interoperability solution for local first responders provided by two ACU1000s. The system uses one 310 foot guyed tower located at Starling Road in Hubert, NC. The SmartNet II system is not compliant with Project 25 (P25) standards; it is not capable of Over the Air Programming (OTAP) or Over the Air Rekeying (OTAR). The LMR system is past the end of its lifecycle and can no longer be supported by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Starling Tower only provides 70% coverage of the Base. Limited coverage, as well as in-building Radio Frequency (RF) penetration are issues for first responders. Additionally, the tower, which shows sign of aging and disrepair, is a single point of failure. The base could not provide inspection or maintenance records for the life of the tower. An engineering analysis of the tower is recommended to determine its structural integrity and continued life cycle use. There is no RF System Subsystem (RFSS) capability at MCB Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River; therefore, the Starling Tower site can only provide the installation with a site trunking capability. There is a conventional backup system. There are no Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) assets in place. The MCB Camp Lejeune/MCAS New River has a well-developed CERS with a registered primary Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) consolidated dispatch and Emergency Operations Center (EOC) that runs WebEOC for all of MCI East. The MCB Camp Lejeune/MCAS New River supports its own first responders, including Fire/Emergency Medical Service (EMS), Provost Marshal's Office (PMO), and Crash, Fire, Rescue (CFR). The base also has a strong working relationship with the City of Jacksonville and Onslow County to include first responder support. Automating Geographical Information System (GIS) map updates and establishing interoperability between the GIS and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) would improve operations and visibility among dispatches and first responders.

Overview

The Emergency Management Command and Coordination (EMC2) Site Survey was conducted 30 August to 2 September 2010 to establish a capabilities "baseline" of Marine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River.

1.1

Base Details

The MCB Camp Lejeune encompasses 156,000 acres, 11 miles of beach capable of supporting amphibious operations, 34 gun positions, 50 tactical landing zones, three state-of-the-art training facilities for Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT), and 80 live fire ranges to include the Greater Sandy Run Training Area. Today, as in the past, the MCB Camp Lejeune mission remains the same ­ to maintain combat-ready units for expeditionary deployment. There are five major Marine Corps commands and one Navy command aboard MCB Camp Lejeune. The Marine Corps Base owns all the real estate, operates entry-level and career level formal schools, and provides support and training for tenant commands: II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF), 2d Marine Division (MARDIV), 2d Force Combat Service Support Group (CSSG), II Marine Expeditionary Force Augmentation Command Element (II MACE), and Chemical, Biological, Incident Response Force (CBIRF). The Naval Hospital provides primary medical care to Marines, Sailors, Retirees, and family members located at MCB Camp Lejeune, MCB Camp Geiger, MCB Camp Johnson, MCAS New River, and surrounding communities 1. Camp Lejeune's infrastructure and personnel occupy six base-identified populated areas: Main Base, Main Base Housing, Midway Park, North Site (Tarawa Terrace I and II), Stone Bay (Rifle Range), and South Site (Courthouse Bay). The MCAS New River is laid out on 2600 acres of land. The MCAS New River is home to 200 aircraft, which operate off runways measuring more than 5,000 feet. The major commands of MCAS New River are as follows: MCAS Headquarters, Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) 26 and 29, Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron (H&HS), and Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS)-272. 2 The MCAS New River's infrastructure and personnel occupy three base-identified populated areas: Main Side, Camp Geiger, and a New Construction Area.

Base Infrastructure
Organizational Structure

The MCB Camp Lejeune's Department of Public Safety, including MCAS New River, has been identified as a best practice for public safety operations by the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) Plans, Programs and Operations (PP&O) and won an honorable mention award from Harvard Installations Excellence. The department's organizational structure is in line with the National Response Plan. This organizational structure allows MCB Camp Lejeune/MCAS New River's first responders to operate cohesively with local authorities to help ensure the quickest response. This structure aligns with the surrounding counties and cities that are organized in a similar fashion, making the mutual aid between jurisdictional boundaries exceedingly robust. The MCB Camp Lejeune first responders for Fire/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) include: Sandy Run, French Creek, Hadnot Point, Paradise Point, Midway Park, Camp Johnson, Camp Geiger, Stone Bay, and Courthouse Bay. The MCB Camp Lejeune also supports a Provost Marshal's Office (PMO). Other entities that support and/or interface with first responders, include EOC and a consolidated dispatch. The MCAS New River first responders include Fire/EMS and PMO. Crash, Fire, and Rescue (CFR) is not covered under EMC2 but is a primary first responder for any incident involving aircraft or aircraft fuel; it serves as a secondary first responder for all other fire incidents.

Enterprise Land Mobile Radio
Current System

The MCB Camp Lejeune/MCAS New River has a legacy LMR system. The legacy LMR network is a Motorola SmartNet II, trunked, analog, wide band system consisting of ten repeaters operating in the 406 ­ 420 Megahertz (MHz) range. The system has one site controller and an interoperability solution for local first responders provided by two ACU1000s. The system uses one 310 foot guyed tower located at Starling Road in Hubert, NC. The SmartNet II system is not compliant with Project 25 (P25) standards; it is not capable of Over the Air Programming (OTAP) or Over the Air Rekeying (OTAR). The system is past the end of its lifecycle and can no longer be supported by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Table 2-1 identifies details of MCB Camp Lejeune/MCAS New River's current RF system.

Coverage

The current Radio Frequency (RF) coverage is not sufficient for MCB Camp Lejeune/MCAS New River. According to surveys conducted by the Base Communications Chief, Starling Tower provides up to 70% coverage within the boundaries of MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River. Therefore, in-building penetration is limited. Limited in-building penetration is managed through pre-programmed conventional point to point channels for each user group (i.e., Fire, PMO, etc.). The users have been instructed to use the alternate conventional channel when they are unable to transmit on the trunked channel. There is no coverage in the Sandy Run area and limited overall coverage at Courthouse Bay and Stone Bay. Current RF coverage maps for MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River were not available for this report. 2.1.1.2 Sites

A site is any piece of land that contains or may contain any LMR or Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) assets, including towers and buildings.

Radio Frequency Sub-System

There is no Radio Frequency Sub-System (RFSS) at MCB Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River. 2.1.3 2.1.3.1 Starling Tower Site Current RF System

There is no RF System Subsystem (RFSS) capability at MCB Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River; therefore, the Starling Tower site can only provide the installation with a site trunking capability. 2.1.3.2 Site

The Starling Tower Site is the only LMR site on MCB Camp Lejeune and is located on base at an elevation of 30 ft. The site is surrounded by a barbed wire fence that appeared to be in poor condition. The fence is secured by a key lock and an escort is required for access. The site is a flat area with moderate vegetation and requires maintenance such as grass cutting. There is a gravel road providing access to the site. 2.1.3.3 Tower

The Starling Tower is a 310 foot guyed tower. The representatives from MCB Camp Lejeune were unable to provide the tower's age or construction date. The date of last tower inspection is also unknown. Starling Tower shows considerable wear and tear. The tower paint is faded and running rust is visible throughout the structure. The RF Cabling appears to be loose and is missing securing devices, allowing cable weight to be applied to connection points. Only two of the three tower legs are grounded. None of the guy lines are surrounded by fencing, which is required for safety purposes. The ice bridge connecting the tower to the Starling Trunking Hut is missing, which could cause damage to equipment and downtime for the infrastructure. According to MCB Camp Lejeune, there are no records showing an engineering study for the tower or tower analysis.

Executive Summary
The Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, North Carolina (NC), Site Survey was conducted from 6 to 10 December 2010. Representatives from Marine Corps Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center - Atlantic met with the MCAS Cherry Point personnel. The Site Survey Team's goal was to capture the "as-is" baseline of the current Emergency Response System, consisting of Enterprise Land Mobile Radio and Consolidated Emergency Response System. The Installation representatives candidly discussed their systems, infrastructure, organization, and technological capabilities and limitations. The MCAS Cherry Point uses a 14-channel wideband, analog, trunked Motorola SmartNet version R36.16.02 Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system. The system transmits in the 406-420 Megahertz (MHz) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) range. The system includes two ACU-1000s that interface with outside agencies. The system consists of a controller site at the Main Trunk Site and a repeater site at Piney Island. The controller site includes nine Quantars and five MS 5000s. The MS 5000s are not capable of narrowband communications. XTS 2500 handheld radios are configured for analog and digital communications. The radios are P25 compliant. They are capable of encrypted communication; however, MCAS Cherry Point does not use that feature. The current system covers the base's populated areas. Coverage is spotty in the Grants' Landing Officer Housing and Pelican Point areas. In-building coverage is generally good; PMO reports occasional signal degradation in Building 137, the largest building on base. There is no LMR coverage at the Bogue Field auxiliary landing site. The MCAS Cherry Point Consolidated Emergency Response System (CERS) consists of a colocated, partially consolidated dispatch and a first responder network. The co-located dispatch, located in Building 294, includes an Intrusion Detection System monitor and Fire/Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) call takers. A desk sergeant also works in the dispatch center, but is not part of the dispatch function. The dispatch center is staffed in two shifts: day shift and night shift. The day shift is consolidated; all call takers can answer any type of emergency call. The night shift is not, yet, consolidated; it is in the process of cross-training the call takers. The dispatch is part of PMO; however, the Fire Chief is the de facto leadership. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has MCAS Cherry Point registered as a primary Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP); however, the dispatch is not Enhanced 911 compliant. The infrastructure and contracts are in place, but the system is not operating. The MCAS Cherry Point does not transfer calls to other dispatches. It can receive transferred cellular telephone calls. Between 1 January 2010 and 10 December 2010, the dispatch received 1,983 emergency calls. The Dispatch Supervisor estimated that dispatch receives an average of 2,000 emergency calls annually. He said that Fire/EMS receives approximately 60% of the calls; PMO receives the other 40% of calls.

Survey Results
Enterprise Land Mobile Radio
Current System

The MCAS Cherry Point uses a 14-channel wideband, analog, trunked Motorola SmartNet version R36.16.02 Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system. The system transmits in the 406-420 Megahertz (MHz) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) range. The system includes two ACU-1000s that interface with outside agencies. The system consists of a controller site at the Main Trunk Site and a repeater site at Piney Island. The controller site includes nine Quantars and five MS 5000s. The MS 5000s are not capable of narrowband communications. An additional Quantar is in use at Piney Island; however, it does not interface with the UHF LMR system. The XTS 2500 handheld radios are configured for analog and digital communications. The radios are P25 compliant. They are capable of encrypted communication; however, MCAS Cherry Point does not use that feature. The current system covers the base's populated areas. Coverage is spotty in the Grants' Landing Officer Housing and Pelican Point areas. In-building coverage is generally good; PMO reports occasional signal degradation in Building 137, the largest building on base. There is no LMR coverage at the Bogue Field auxiliary landing site. Table 2-1 identifies details of MCAS Cherry Point's current RF system.

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0005-0.1

2.1.3.3

Tower

The Main Trunk Site has an active 199 foot guyed tower supporting MCAS Cherry Point's LMR assets. The tower was built in 1994. Figure 2-3 shows the Main Trunk Site tower.

Figure 2-3. Main Trunk Site Tower 2-8

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0005-0.1

The tower is surrounded by a chain link fence with barbed wire on top. The chain link section is inacceptable condition; however, the barbed wire has pulled away from the fence structure and is hanging down, posing a safety risk. Figure 2-4 shows the deteriorated barbed wire portion of the fence.

According to the Spectrum Manager, Hazard of Electromagnetic Radiation to Personnel (HERP), Hazard of Electromagnetic Radiation to Fuel (HERF), and Hazard of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) assessments were completed on 1 September 2010. The MCAS Cherry Point provided reports on the HERP and HERF assessment; the HERO report was not provided. Based on an informal visual review, the Site Survey Team reported that the tower is fully loaded and unable to accommodate additional LMR assets. Mr. George Cronk, G-6 Operations Manager, provided documentation on proposed MCAS Cherry Point towers. The documentation, prepared in 2008, reports that the maximum allowable tower height at the Main Trunk Site is 150 feet. The current 199 foot tower is grandfathered. Figure 2-7 is an excerpt from the 2008 proposed Main Trunk Site documentation.

Buildings Trunking Hut #1

Trunking Hut #1 serves as MCAS Cherry Point's Controller Site. The 16-year-old building houses the Main Trunk Site's Quantar and MS 5000 repeaters. The building has no windows and is surrounded by a locked chain link fence. The Trunking Hut is constructed on a slab foundation. Due to the low site elevation, the hut is highly susceptible to flooding. The Site Survey team found the building in poor condition, evidenced by buckling tile and weakened floor from water damage.

Interoperability/Paging Hut

The Interoperability/Paging Hut is an RF equipment shelter supporting LMR equipment. The seven-year-old building houses the ACU-1000s and the network management system. The building has no windows and is not fenced. The Interoperability/Paging Hut is constructed on a slab foundation. Due to the Main Site's low elevation, this building is also susceptible to flooding due to the low site elevation. The Survey Team found the Interoperability/Paging Hut in excellent condition.

Centracom Hut

The Centracom Hut supports the dispatch's Centracom equipment. The 19-year-old building has no windows and is surrounded by a locked chain link fence. The Centracom Hut is constructed on a slab foundation. Due to the Main Site's low elevation, this hut is also highly susceptible to flooding. According to SSgt Blue, Spectrum Manager, last year, CEMB had to turn off power to the Centracom Hut because water had entered the building, jeopardizing the equipment. The Survey Team found the Centracom Hut in excellent condition.

Power

Each Main Trunk Site building has a dedicated Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to protect equipment from power outages. The Main Trunk Site includes two backup diesel generators. One generator powers Trunking Hut #1 and the Interoperability/Paging Hut; the other generator powers the Centracom Hut. Each building is outfitted with an Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS). Each generator is rated to provide up to two hours of runtime. Facilities Maintenance performs monthly checks on the generators. The Site Survey Team noted that the bottom of the Centracom Hut generator is rusted. Built in 1992, the generator may need to be replaced.

Piney Island Current RF System

Piney Island is a remote site. There are two Quantar repeaters; one is active and the second is an inactive backup unit. The active Quantar is configured with Very High Frequency (VHF) frequencies. The repeater supports the handheld radios at Piney Island. The Piney Island frequencies were not provided. The Piney Island subscribers are not first responders but, due to their remote location, may be the first emergency responders at an incident. Table 2-8 lists the LMR equipment at Piney Island.

2.1.4.2

Site

The Piney Island Site (BT-11) is located on an island at the confluence of the Neuse River and West Bay near the Cedar Island National Wildlife Refuge. As the crow flies, the Piney Island site is 24.3 miles from the Main Trunk Site. The site is only accessible by scheduling a Marine Corps owned ferry boat through the G-6. Due to the island's protected wetlands status, any construction projects resulting in the destruction of wetlands require the project owner to replace them at a rate of three times the amount removed. For example, a one acre project would require replacement of three acres. 2.1.4.3 Tower

Piney Island has an active 120 foot self-supporting tower. The tower is owned by the Marine Corps and shared with other agencies.

One LMR Motorola Quantar repeater is mounted on the tower. The Piney Island Tower is also occupied by several classified assets. No additional information regarding tower assets is available. According to the Spectrum Manager, HERP, HERF, and HERO assessments were completed on 1 September 2010. MCAS Cherry Point provided reports on the HERP and HERF assessment; the HERO report was not provided. Based on an informal visual review, the Site Survey Team reported that the tower has space for additional assets. 2.1.4.4 Building

There are two small RF equipment shelters on Piney Island. The shelters are used for sensitive and secure equipment belonging to other systems. The LMR Quantar repeaters are located in those shelters. If additional LMR assets are installed at the Piney Island site, a third small equipment shelter would be required. 2.1.4.5 Power

The Site Survey Team was unable to assess the shelter; therefore, no power data was collected. 2.1.5 Subscriber Units

Table 2-9 identifies the MCAS Cherry Point subscriber unit allocation as provided by Mr. George Cronk, G-6 Operations Manager.

The XTS 2500 handheld units are Project 25 (P25) compliant. The XTS 2500s are currently configured for wideband transmission. If MCAS Cherry Point adopted a narrowband RF system, the same subscriber hardware would be usable. The MCAS Cherry Point purchased 942 flash upgrades at $420 each to make their XTS 2500 radios compatible with analog or digital systems. Half of the flash upgrades have been applied. The XTS 2500s are capable of encryption; however, MCAS Cherry Point does not use this feature. According to Mr. Critcher, the base does not encrypt the radios due to physical security concerns. However, XTS 2500 encryption is Type III and does not have the same physical security requirements as Type I or Type II. Mr. Critcher said that MCAS Cherry Point has three Key Variable Loader (KVL) 3000s to encrypt all radios and does not have the personnel to manually load each radio. 2.1.6 Manpower/Training

The CEMD is responsible for LMR system management and maintenance. The department is staffed by three civilians, four Marines, and one civilian supervisor. All CEMD employees have electronics backgrounds, are trained on E-LMR, and attended the Motorola repair school. In 2009, CEMD reportedly spent $36,000 on staff training. In addition to supporting the LMR system, CEMD performs routine facilities services and repairs computers and related equipment. The PMO has 252 personnel; these employees learn radio operation during their two-and-half week orientation training. Fire/EMS has 58 personnel in four stations. Fire fighters and EMS personnel also receive basic radio operation training during orientation. Additional training is On-the-Job. 2.1.7 Maintenance/Logistics

CEMD maintains the current RF system. The base has entered into a contract with RadioOne Communications to support the analog repeaters. For $1,490 per month, RadioOne Communications must maintain an inventory of repair components to keep MCAS Cherry Point's RF system operational. These parts are no longer manufactured. According to Mr. Critcher, this contract is used for emergency repairs. If RadioOne Communications cannot provide sufficient quantities of components for a repair, the contract dissolves.

Proposed Sites
Bogue Field Bogue Field Current RF System

Bogue Field does not support any LMR assets. The CFR is the only fire/emergency responder to Bogue Field. CFR has a handheld radio communication range of one-half to one mile and along the perimeter of the airfield. Radio communications are line of sight. The CFR relies heavily on outside agencies; however, there is no radio interoperability. All communication with outside agencies happens via landline or cellular telephone. The PMO provide gate access and law enforcement at Bogue Field; however, it can only use handhelds to communicate with Cherry Point via the Air Ops Channel. There is no LMR radio communication to dispatch. 4.2.1.2 Bogue Field Site

Bogue Field is an auxiliary landing site for MCAS Cherry Point. As the crow flies, the Bogue Field site is 14.8 miles from the Main Trunk Site. The site is surrounded by a chain link fence
4-4

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0005-0.1

with combination lock. The fence is in good condition. Site access requires an escort and advanced notification of entry. 4.2.1.3 Bogue Field Tower

Bogue Field has an active 199 foot self-supporting tower; no LMR assets are installed on it. Although the tower is owned by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), it is heavily used by the Navy and Air Force. GySgt Palacios, MCAS Cherry Point Spectrum Manager, was unable to provide construction records for the tower and did not know when it was last inspected. HERP, HERF, and HERO assessments were performed in September 2010. The tower appeared to be in good condition. The tower is surrounded by a chain link fence with combination lock. The fence is in good condition. Based on an informal visual review, the Site Survey Team reported that the tower has space for additional assets.

According to GySgt Palacios, the Bogue Field tower is aligned with the Cherry Point Main Trunk Site tower and Marine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Lejeune's Starling Tower. Given the relatively short distance between these towers, GySgt Palacios said it may be possible to install LMR assets on the Bogue Field tower to establish uninterrupted LMR communications between Cherry Point and Camp Lejeune. Figure 4-3 illustrates the proximity of MCAS Cherry Point's Main Trunk Site and Bogue Field to MCB Camp Lejeune's Starling Tower.

Executive Summary
The Marine Corps Base (MCB) Quantico, VA, and Marine Corps Air Facility (MCAF) Quantico Site Survey was conducted from 13-17 September 2010. Representatives from Marine Corps Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center -Atlantic met with Marine Corps Installations National Capital Region, MCB Quantico, and MCAF Quantico. The Site Survey Team's goal was to capture the "as-is" baseline of the current Emergency Response System. The Installation representatives candidly discussed their systems, infrastructure, organization, and technological capabilities and limitations. The MCB Quantico, MCAF Quantico, and the associated National Capital Region (NCR) commands are covered by a 23-channel (two unused) Motorola SmartZoneŽ v6.5 Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) system. The system transmits and receives in the allocated military frequency range of 380-399 Megahertz (MHz). The system has a Radio Frequency Subsystem regional master site for the NCR and is capable of Over the Air Rekey to the Advanced Encryption Standard encrypted subscriber units. The MCB Quantico E-LMR infrastructure is supported by five on-line Radio Frequency (RF) tower sites. The RF coverage percentages over the Base's seven populated areas have yet to be determined. The MCB Quantico location supports 286 E-LMR Slice subscriber units. The current system has limited redundancy regarding wide-area trunking to the RF sites. The evidence suggests that those sites that have recently experienced periods of denied access due to insufficient channels to support the number of users currently on the system. The MCB Quantico location has a limited Consolidated Emergency Response System (CERS). The MCB Quantico, MCAF Quantico, Quantico Corporate Center, and Barrett Heights locations are serviced by a 911 dispatch aboard the base; the base dispatch is not a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). Although the dispatch employs a Nine One One Incorporated Quick Response TM (V 2.0) E-9-1-1 system, Enhanced 911 (E911) capabilities are limited to business lines connected to the Base Telephone Infrastructure (BTI); E911 does not extend to commercial leased lines, cellular calls, or nomadic Voice over Internet Protocol. Fire/Emergency Medical Services and Provost Marshal Office dispatchers are co-located but not consolidated. The dispatch center facility is inadequate to support sustained CERS functionality. The CERS does not include Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) or Geographical Information System (GIS) interface. The MCB Quantico location has an Emergency Operations Center (EOC); however, the facility does not have preinstalled dedicated infrastructure. The EOC stands up in the Commander's Conference Room at Lejeune Hall and is operated by the Mission Assurance Steering Council. Interoperability agreements and Mutual Aid Agreements are in place with the surrounding communities; however, interoperable radio solutions are limited to the Virginia statewide frequencies and shared radios.

Overview

The Emergency Management Command and Control (EMC2) Site Survey was conducted from 13 to 17 September 2010 to establish a capabilities "baseline" of Marine Corps Base (MCB) Quantico and Marine Corps Air Facility (MCAF) Quantico.

1.1

Base Details

The 100 square mile (59,000 acre) base is located near the town of Triangle, VA, in the tricounty area of Prince William County (PWC), Stafford County, and Fauquier County. These adjacent counties are partners with MCB Quantico in times of emergency. The MCAF Quantico is located adjacent to Mainside; for the purpose of this report MCAF Quantico is deemed an extension of Mainside. The MCB Quantico location, primarily a United States Marine Corps (USMC) training base, is home to numerous units, commands, and tenant activities. These commands include the Marine Corps Security Group (MCSG), Marine Corps Marathon (MCM), Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC), Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), Marine Corps Recruiting Command, Manpower and Reserve Affairs Division of Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Marine Corps Training and Education Command (TECOM), The Basic School (TBS), Marine Corps University (MCU), Officer Candidates School (OCS), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) training academy, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy and Laboratory, FBI Hostage and Rescue Team (HRT), and Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1). Table 1-1 represents the combined populations for the Base and Air Facility according to the June 2010 population report and reported by MCB Quantico's Public Affairs Office (PAO).

Base Infrastructure
Organizational Structure

The MCB Quantico location does not have an official Public Safety Division; however, their organizational structure is in line with the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The organizational structure ensures all of MCB Quantico's first responders operate cohesively and help ensure the best response for the Marines living on base as well as those living in the community. This structure bodes well for cooperation with the surrounding counties and cities, which makes mutual aid between jurisdictional boundaries exceedingly robust. Agencies involved in public safety aboard MCB Quantico fall under the authority of the Base Commander. Fire/Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and the Provost Marshal's Office (PMO)

Survey Results
Enterprise Land Mobile Radio
Current System

When the survey began, MCB Quantico used two distinct systems: the legacy Very High Frequency (VHF) Land Mobile Radio (LMR) and the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) system. With the exception of Fire/EMS and Forestry, all Base first responders were using the E-LMR system. Fire/EMS and Forestry cut over to the E-LMR system on 17 September 2010, the last day of the site survey. The remainder of this report focuses exclusively on the E-LMR system. The E-LMR system operates in the 380-399 Megahertz (MHz) frequency range. The E-LMR system is a narrowband, trunked, Project 25 (P25) compliant, 23-channel (two unused) Motorola SmartZoneŽ v6.5 system. The MCB Quantico location has a Radio Frequency Subsystem (RFSS) responsible for Marine Corps Installations National Capital Region (MCNCR). Table 2-1 describes the Current Radio Frequency (RF) system aboard MCB Quantico.

Figure 2-1. Current E-LMR Infrastructure ­ MCB Quantico

The system consists of a Motorola Master Site located in Building (Bldg) 3098 (Diamond Hall) and six remote RF sites connecting E-LMR assets to the RFSS. Two RF sites are located onbase: the former Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) location (five channels) and the Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT) location (seven channels). There are three offbase RF sites that are currently online: Sheraton (five channels), Independent Hill (two channels), and Fredericksburg (two channels). Waldorf (two channels) was an additional off-base RF site that was installed to provide coverage for MCB Quantico's emergency response on the Potomac river; this site was never powered on and has since been removed and the equipment is in the process of being installed aboard MCB Quantico at the Range Control tower site to provide coverage to the Camp Barrett area of responsibility. Table 2-2 describes RF site infrastructure associated with the MCB Quantico E-LMR system.

Coverage

Current system coverage maps were developed by NAVSEA Corona in 2006. Ground coverage analysis was done in the 380-400 MHz frequency range with C4FM modulation simulating a P25 trunked radio system. Portable talk-out parameters assume a portable antenna height of 4 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) with a base station transmit power of 100 watts. Portable talk-back parameters assume a base station antenna height of 120 feet AGL and portable transmit power of 5 watts. Based on Site Survey interviews, there is limited in-building coverage throughout the base. Interviews revealed that TBS and main arterial roads leading to areas west of Interstate 95 (I-95). Figure 2-2 to Figure 2-7 depict portable talk-out and talk-back outside coverage areas for MARS, MOUT, and Independent Hill, respectively. Inside coverage and overall coverage percentages cannot be determined due to age of the plots and the inclusion of proposed sites in the analysis.

Radio Frequency Sub-System Current RF System

The Quantico Master Site is located in Bldg 3098, Diamond Hall, in the secure server room; it is considered a regional RFSS for the NCR. There is a Network Management (NM) client located at Bldg 2043 Materiel Logistics Branch (MLB). Remote RF sites are connected to the Master Site via T-1 circuits. Master Site equipment and all redundant systems are housed in 12 racks, three-and-a-half of which are available for expansion. The base has eight Key Variable Loaders (KVLs) and a Key Management Facility (KMF) client. However, according to the Motorola Field Service Technician (FST), contracted to the G-6, the KMF client cannot be located and the base lacks personnel trained to use the KMF. Subscriber Units are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encrypted; however, due to the lack of KMF client, Over the Air Rekeying (OTAR) is not being used and radios must be manually rekeyed via the KVL. Table 2-8 lists the equipment associated with the MCB Quantico Master Site.

Tower

There is no tower associated with the MCB Quantico Master Site. 2.1.2.3 Building

Bldg 3098 (Diamond Hall) is constructed of brick and is more than 60 years old. The Base G-6 controls access to the restricted building; security clearance is required for entry. Within Bldg 3098, the Master Site equipment is housed in a server room with controlled access. The E-LMR system occupies nine individual racks in two rows. The server room has telephone and network connectivity as well as fiber and twisted pair copper. Thirty-five fiber strands and five pairs of copper are available. The server room is protected by Intrusion Detection System (IDS), smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, and a fire suppression system. The IDS is monitored by PMO. 2.1.2.4 Power

Bldg 3098 server room utilizes shore power. The server room is protected by Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS) and the building has a backup generator. Shore power is 120 Volt (V) three-phase and the existing power load of the building is 225 amps. The backup generator is a Cummings QuietSite located next to the fence line just outside the building. MCB Quantico G-6 is responsible for this generator. A new maintenance contract was in development during the time of the Site Survey. 2.1.3 2.1.3.1 MARS Hill Current RF System

The MARS site is configured as a five-channel Motorola Quantar repeater site. This site provides coverage over most of Mainside MCB Quantico and into parts of the Potomac River. The RF site equipment is connected to the RFSS via a T-1 circuit that traverses the BTI. The dedicated T-1 is a single point of failure in relation to wide-area trunking. The SmartZoneŽ system is designed to offer site trunking in the event of connectivity failure between the RF site and RFSS. In the event of site controller failure, the system reverts to fail-soft mode. The site is programmed to allow any of the talk channels to act as a control channel in the event of control channel failure. The site also has a redundant Local Area Network (LAN) switch and redundant site controller. Table 2-9 lists the E-LMR assets associated with MARS.

According to the Marine Corps Network Operations and Security Command (MCNOSC) MCI NCR capacity report, the MARS site supports 632 users. There are also 182 users associated with the Waldorf site, which is currently turned off. Due to geographical location, these users would primarily be supported by the MARS tower, bringing the total number of users to 824. Based on the industry standard of 100 users per channel plus a control channel, this site should be at least ten channels; however, this would leave no room for expansion or redundancy. The month after complete cutover to the new system this site processed 103,102 active calls. There were 454 busies the month after cutover for 99.56% reliability. The MARS site is also the relay point for the MOUT RF site E-LMR communications. The microwave shot terminates at MARS and is routed via base infrastructure copper and fiber to Bldg 3098 and the RFSS. 2.1.3.2 Site

The MARS Hill, or MARS, site is located on base adjacent to Bldg 2117 (MCB Quantico dispatch). The site has an unlocked fence in poor condition which does not completely surround the site perimeter as there is open access through the road leading to MARS Hill. No escort is needed but MLB notification is desired. There are no known zoning restrictions for this site and it is not located in a protected area. The site is shared by PMO for K-9 training; the training area is located beyond the dispatch building behind a locked gate.

Building

Two RF shelters and the MCB Quantico dispatch center (Bldg 2117) are located on the MARS site. One RF shelter houses an ACU-1000 system with P25 M/A-Com radios; the other houses the tower's E-LMR RF equipment. The ACU-1000 shelter is not part of the MCB Quantico ELMR system. The E-LMR RF equipment shelter was constructed in 2004 specifically for use with the E-LMR system. It is located eight feet from the MARS tower. The Survey Team observed heavy vegetation growing near and around the building.

2-13

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0009-0.1

There are no windows and this shelter is secured with a deadbolt lock; there is no surrounding fencing. There are alarm connections inside the shelter, including IDS, power, and environmental; however, they are not connected. No indication was given as to if these were to be connected in the future. Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is provided by two Bard wall mount heating/air combination units. The shelter appeared to be in good condition with no external damage. There are 16 open Rack Unit (RU) spaces, in a single rack, for expansion. Refer to Table 2-5 for building specifics. Figure 2-9 illustrates the RF equipment shelter at MARS Hill.

Power

All equipment at the MARS RF Shelter runs off 240 Volts Alternating Current (VAC) singlephase shore power. There is a Liebert UPS running at 120 VAC and eight DataSafe HR800STD batteries used for power conditioning and temporary power until the generator is capable of sustaining the power load. There is also a Generac back-up generator that is rated to provide 30 hours of back-up power to the site RF equipment. 2.1.4 2.1.4.1 MOUT Current RF System

The MOUT location is configured as a seven-channel Motorola Quantar repeater site. This site covers Camp Upshur and training areas west of I-95; coverage for TBS/Camp Barrett is limited. Current connectivity to the RFSS is a T-1 circuit through a Harris Constellation Microwave connection to MARS Hill and then to Bldg 3098 via the BTI. There is fiber connectivity planned

2-14

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0009-0.1

for the site to replace the microwave radio connection; the fiber is currently in place but not yet connected to the E-LMR infrastructure. No date was given as to when the fiber link was being connected or activated. There is no redundancy for the microwave connectivity and the dedicated T-1 is a single point of failure in relation to wide-area trunking. The SmartZoneŽ system is designed to offer site trunking in the event of connectivity failure between the RF site and RFSS. In the event of site controller failure, the system reverts to fail-soft mode. The site is programmed to allow any of the talk channels to act as a control channel in the event of control channel failure. The site also has a redundant LAN switch and site controller. Table 2-11 lists the E-LMR assets associated with MOUT.

According to the MCNSOC MCI NCR Capacity Report, the MOUT site supports 530 users. There are also 578 users associated with TBS, which has no active tower. Due to geographical location, the TBS users would primarily be supported by the MOUT site, bringing the total number of users to 1108. Based on the industry standard of 100 users per channel plus a control channel, this site should be at least 12 channels if no site is built at Range Control/TBS; however, this would leave no room for expansion or redundancy. If a site is built at Range Control/TBS this site has sufficient channelization. The month after complete cutover to the new system this site processed 71,571 active calls. There were no busies reported during the month at MOUT. 2.1.4.2 Site

The MOUT site is located on base in the Range area, .19 miles from Landing Zone Cardinal. MOUT is a remote site located in a live fire training area. Clearance from Range Control is

2-15

N65236-ELMR-SURVEY-0009-0.1

required for access. The site has a tower and an RF equipment shelter surrounded by a chain link fence, locked with a standard key lock. The Survey Team observed the current vegetation needed clearing. 2.1.4.3 Tower

The MOUT tower is a 153 foot AGL self-supporting tower. The tower was constructed in 2002 for the Marine Corps E-LMR effort. The Base did not know if any tower inspections had been performed since its construction. The tower was observed to be in good condition. A soil analysis was conducted near the tower foundation by Terracon Consultants Inc. in November 2008. The transmit antenna height for E-LMR equipment is 140 feet; the receive antenna is 150 feet. The microwave antenna is located at 130 feet. Figure 2-10 illustrates the tower at MOUT.

Power

The RF equipment at MOUT is run off 120/240 VAC single-phase shore power. There is a Liebert UPS running at 120 VAC and eight DataSafe HR800-STD batteries used for power conditioning and temporary power until the generator is capable of sustaining the power load. There is also a Generac back-up generator, built in 2004, that is rated to provide 30.7 hours of back-up power to the site RF equipment. During the survey there was an audible alert on the UPS and the control panel indicated a fault. There is no remote monitoring of this site to ensure continuous operation. Also during the survey, the site lost shore power and ran on the back-up generator until all fuel was exhausted. The first indication of power loss was complete failure of the site.

Independent Hill Current RF System

Independent Hill is configured as a two-channel Motorola Quantar repeater site. This site offers coverage over the northern part of training areas west of I-95. The RF site equipment is connected to the RFSS via a leased commercial T-1. The dedicated T-1 is a single point of failure in relation to wide-area trunking. The SmartZoneŽ system is designed to offer site trunking in the event of connectivity failure between the RF site and RFSS. In the event of site controller failure, the system reverts to fail-soft mode. There are only two channels, so no redundancy exists in the event of repeater failure. The site has a redundant LAN switch and site controller. Table 2-13 lists the E-LMR assets associated with Independent Hill.

Manpower/Training

According to the current MCB Quantico Table of Organization (TO), G-6 rates three USMC Radio Operators, Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 0621. These allotments are residuals from older systems and are not specific for E-LMR. Currently, the MLB G-6 has two 0621s; neither has formal Motorola training for the SmartZoneŽ system. The 0621s do have formal Marine Corps training. Both 0621s are responsible for programming radios and running the RRS but do not have any responsibilities for the Motorola infrastructure equipment. The MLB has one civilian Wage Grade (WG) employee who does older vehicle radio installs and basic vehicular radio troubleshooting. The MCB Quantico G-6 also has a contract for on-base Motorola vendor support with an FST. Table 2-21 provides a breakdown of E-LMR manpower support at MCB Quantico.

Maintenance/Logistics

The Quantico G-6 pays $250,000 per year for a Motorola Field Service Technician (FST). This cost does not cover maintenance. There is no maintenance contract for the E-LMR repeaters, infrastructure, or subscriber assets. The warranties have expired for all equipment. Motorola offers a flat-fee repair service that covers routine repairs on the XTS-5000/2500 portable radios for $393 and $465 for XTL-5000 mobile radios and consolettes. This fee is levied per radio on a per repair incident basis and does not cover physical or water damage to the radio; Motorola provides estimates to repair radios with physical or water damage. Motorola is discontinuing the flat-fee repair service for XTL-5000s and consolettes after March 2012. Quantico G-6 estimates that a maintenance contract to support all E-LMR assets aboard Quantico, including Subscriber Units, Repeaters, Infrastructure and Rapid Response System (RRS), will cost approximately $600,000 per year.

Alternative Method

Interoperability, for this system, was designed to be accomplished via consolettes interfaced with the CEB and with connections maintained via the dispatch console by the dispatcher. Only two of eight consolettes are connected to the CEB, one in the statewide 800 MHz range and one using the statewide low band VHF channel. The remaining six consolettes are unused due to lack of available cards in the CEB and room for antenna installation on current tower structures. Fire/EMS has loaned radios from PWC and Stafford County to facilitate interoperability. There is no seamless interoperability for EMS personnel and the Hospital Emergency Awareness Radios (HEAR) VHF conventional channel used to communicate with Mary Washington (MWH) and Potomac Hospitals. There is also an ACU-1000, radio interoperability system, located at the MARS site. Due to maintenance issues, the ACU-1000 was completely powered down and not in use.

Upshur, as well as a new fire station are future possibilities. There is no current infrastructure, tower, or building for and RF repeater site at Camp Upshur. 4.2.3 Marine Barracks Washington, 8th& I

The MBW 8th&I and the HMX-1 detachment in Anacostia, MD, currently use the Sheraton for RF coverage. The spectrum manager from MCB Quantico stated that users at MBW have reported coverage is limited. MBW 8th & I is located in the city, which creates areas of limited RF coverage from the Sheraton, which is located about 5 miles from 8th & I. Quantico G-6 has expressed a desire to install an RF site at the MBW building. 4.2.4 Manassas

The current First Responder mission, as defined by Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) PP&O, is limited to the boundaries of the base. If this mission is to be expanded to support off-base emergencies, additional coverage would be required. Although no prospective sites were visited in the Manassas, VA, area, an RF repeater site in this area would assist in this newly defined mission.

Building

There are two RF shelters at the Waldorf site: one is a private commercial shelter and the other shelter houses E-LMR assets. The E-LMR asset shelter was built in September 2009 specifically for the E-LMR project and was in excellent condition, with no external damage observed. There are no windows on the shelter; it is secured with a keyed lock and the entire site was surrounded by a chain link, barbed wire fence, which was secured with a keyed lock at the entry gate. There are alarm connections inside the shelter, including IDS, power, and environmental; however, these are not connected. HVAC is provided by two Bard wall mount heating/air combination units. The interior had ample open rack space for expansion. Refer to Table 2-5 for building specifics. Figure 4-2 illustrates the RF equipment shelter at Waldorf site.

Executive Summary
The Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Beaufort and Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) Parris Island Site Survey was conducted from 12 to 15 October 2010. Representatives from Marine Corps Systems Command and Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic met with the MCAS Beaufort and MCRD Parris Island personnel. The Site Survey Team's goal was to capture the "as-is" baseline of the current Emergency Response System. The Installations' representatives candidly discussed their systems, infrastructure, organization, and technological capabilities and limitations. The MCAS Beaufort and MCRD Parris Island's Enhanced Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) system operates in the 380-399 Megahertz frequency range. The E-LMR system is a narrowband, trunked, Project 25 (P25) compliant, 14-channel, Motorola Astro 25 SmartZoneŽ v6.1. There is no Key Management Facility Client or Server associated with the system and it is not capable of Over the Air Programming and Over the Air Rekey. The current system is leased from Motorola on a yearly contract, paid for by Marine Corps Installations-East. The MCAS Beaufort is the Radio Frequency Sub System responsible for the Tri-Command community. The MCAS Beaufort has a consolidated Fire/Emergency Management System (EMS) and Provost Marshal's Office (PMO) dispatch staffed by civilian contractors. There is no Enhanced 911 (E911) system and basic 911 calls are limited to Base Telephone Infrastructure (BTI) calls. No emergency calls are recorded and radio communications recordings are limited to one PMO talkgroup. There is no Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) or Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping capability and the dispatch is not considered a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). The MCAS Beaufort self-reports 1,296 emergency calls and 792 non-emergency calls dispatched per year. The MCRD Parris Island has a co-located Fire/EMS and PMO dispatch staffed by government civilians and US Marines (PMO only). There is no E911 system and basic 911 calls are limited to BTI calls. Emergency phone conversations and emergency radio traffic are not recorded. There is no CAD or GIS mapping capability and the dispatch is not considered a PSAP. The MCRD Parris Island self-reports 1,392 emergency calls and 600 non-emergency calls dispatched per year.

Overview

The Emergency Management Command and Coordination (EMC2) Site Survey was conducted from 12 to 15 October 2010 to establish a capabilities "baseline" of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Beaufort and Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) Parris Island. The two bases along with the Naval Hospital are commonly referred to as "Tri-Command," as they share several common resources such as base housing and Provost Marshal's Office (PMO).

1.1
1.1.1

Base Details
MCAS Beaufort

The MCAS Beaufort is located in the heart of the South Carolina Low Country and is among the United States military's most important and most historically colorful installations. Consisting of some 6,900 acres, the installation is home to seven Marine Corps F/A-18 squadrons. Two Navy F/A-18 squadrons joined the "Fightertown" community in March 2000, for a total of nine squadrons. The MCAS Beaufort hosts all active duty United States Marine Corps (USMC) F/A-18 air operations assigned to the Marine Aircraft Group (MAG)-31 on the East Coast. The mission of MCAS Beaufort is to provide support as an operational base for MAG-31 and the support units. The mission of the MAG-31 is to conduct anti-air-warfare and offensive air support operations in support of Fleet Marine Forces (FMF) from advanced bases, expeditionary airfields, or aircraft carriers and conduct such other air operations as may be directed. 1 Table 1-1 represents the populations for MCAS Beaufort as reported by Public Affairs and Base Housing.

MCRD Parris Island

The MCRD Parris Island is one of the birthplaces of basic training for Marines. About 19,000 recruits are trained at Parris Island each year. The Recruit Training Regiment is comprised of four recruit training battalions and one support battalion. The regiment, along with the Weapons and Field Training Battalion, are made up of drill instructors and other Marines who are responsible for training recruits. 2 Table 1-2 represents the populations for MCRD Parris Island as reported by Public Affairs and Base Housing.

Base Infrastructure
Organizational Structure

Neither MCAS Beaufort nor MCRD Parris Island has an official Public Safety Division. On both bases, Fire/Emergency Medical Service (EMS) falls under the auspices of the Base (S4 MCAS and G4 MCRD), while MCAS Beaufort PMO is directly under the Base Commander's authority. The MCAS Beaufort PMO is responsible for law enforcement aboard MCRD Parris Island. The organizational structure resembles the National Incident Management System (NIMS), but does not fall directly in line with the overall concept, as PMO and Fire do not fall under an operational command.

Radio Frequency Sub-System Current RF System

The Master Site, located at MCAS Beaufort, supports MCAS Beaufort and MCRD Parris Island. It also ties in Beaufort County and Laurel Bay to the MCAS Beaufort/MCRD Parris Island current RF system via the Laurel Bay Water Tower RF Site and the Parris Island Rappel Tower RF Site. The Laurel Bay Water Tower and the Rappel Tower are connected to the RFSS via individual T-1 circuits. The system supports five channels. There is no Key Management Facility (KMF) Client or Server associated with the system and it is not capable of Over the Air Programming (OTAP) or Over the Air Rekey (OTAR). Subscriber Units are capable of but do not use Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption. Per MSgt Robert Sprouse, MCAS Beaufort Telephone Staff Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (SNCOIC), MCAS Beaufort has Key Variable Loaders (KVL); however, they do not use the keys because MCI-East directed the MCAS to use the systems key instead.

Power

All equipment at the Master Site RF shelter runs off 120/208 Volts Alternating Current (VAC) commercial power. Power is conditioned through a Liebert Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), which provides temporary backup power to the site RF equipment until the generator is capable of sustaining the power load. There is a Cummings DGDA-5735037 generator that is rated to provide 20 hours of backup power to the site RF equipment in the event of a power loss.

MCAS Beaufort Laurel Bay Water Tower Current RF System

The Laurel Bay Water Tower is configured as a four-channel Motorola Quantar repeater site. This site primarily provides coverage for Laurel Bay housing and the areas between MCRD Parris Island and MCAS Beaufort. The RF equipment is connected to the RFSS via a T-1 circuit that traverses the Base Telephone Infrastructure (BTI). The dedicated T-1 is a single point of failure in relation to wide-area trunking. The SmartZoneŽ system is designed to offer site trunking in the event of connectivity failure between the RF site and the RFSS. In the event of site controller failure, the system reverts to fail-soft mode.

Tower

The Laurel Bay Water Tower is a 116-foot, self-supporting tower that is commercially owned by the Beaufort Jasper Water Sanitation Authority (BJWSA). The United States Marine Corps (USMC) leases space on the tower for its E-LMR antennas. The E-LMR antennas are 20-feet tall and mounted on the sides and top of the tower. The existing E-LMR equipment is not properly grounded on the tower. The RF grounding straps were connected to the tower leg via hose clamp and not properly secured.

Building

One RF equipment shelter, Building 2197, is located at the Laurel Bay Water Tower site. The pre-fabricated equipment shelter was built in April 2009 specifically for the E-LMR system. It is located directly underneath the water tower. The shelter has no exterior damage. There is no open rack space for expansion. The shelter is secured with a key twist lock and the building is enclosed within the site's fence. There are no alarms inside the equipment shelter. Figure 2-10 shows the RF equipment shelter at the Laurel Bay RF Site.

Power

All equipment at the RF equipment shelter runs off 120/240 VAC single-phase shore power. Power is conditioned through an UPS on site. There is no backup generator. MSgt Sprouse said a work order had been submitted for a backup generator to be installed at the Laurel Bay Water Tower Site. Figure 2-11 shows the Laurel Bay Water Tower equipment shelter power source.

MCRD Parris Island Rappel Tower Current RF System

The Rappel Tower RF Site is configured as a five-channel Motorola Quantar repeater site. The RF site provides coverage for all of MCRD Parris Island. The RF site equipment is connected to the RFSS via a T-1 circuit that traverses the BTI. The dedicated T-1 is a single point of failure in relation to wide-area trunking. The SmartZoneŽ system is designed to offer site trunking in the event of connectivity failure between the RF site and the RFSS. In the event of site controller failure, the system reverts to fail-soft mode. The site is programmed to allow any of the talk channels to act as a control channel in the event of control channel failure. Building 4002, the RF Site equipment shelter, has a T-1 line coming in and connecting to the Master Site at MCAS Beaufort.

Site

The Rappel Tower site is located on MCRD Parris Island near the old airfield. The site is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. The fence is leaning and shows signs of surface rust; the Survey Team also observed heavy vegetation around it. This fence is rarely closed and locked due to recruits needing access to the Rappel Tower. Officially, site access requires notification to G-6, who assigns an escort.

Tower

The RF tower is a 231-foot, guyed tower. MSgt Sprouse estimated that the tower is at least 35 years old; however, he could not confirm the date of construction. In June 2009, the tower was inspected and found to be a potential detriment to human life. It was reportedly repaired to a serviceable state, but the paperwork for the repairs was unavailable. The Survey Team observed heavy vegetation around the guy wire foundation points.

Building

The Rappel Tower site consists of one RF shelter, Building 4002. The building is dilapidated. The RF shelter houses two full racks of LMR equipment. The shelter is located ten feet from the tower and is secured with a keyed lock. There is a small equipment room inside the main building. The room does not have room for expansion in the existing racks. This system operated until September 20, 2010 when lightning struck Building 4002, damaging the LMR equipment. According to the Motorola Field Service Technician (FST), the equipment is no longer in functioning condition. The legacy equipment was replaced with E-LMR equipment. If the non-functioning LMR gear was removed, the equipment room would have room for expansion. The building has fire alarms, which are monitored by dispatch.

Manpower/Training MCAS Beaufort

The MCAS Beaufort S-6 has a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 0613 (USMC Construction Wireman) and a 2844 (USMC Ground Communication Organizational Repairman) supporting the E-LMR system. None of these individuals have formal Motorola training for the SmartZoneŽ system. They have formal Marine Corps MOS training and On-the-Job Training (OJT) on the E-LMR system. There is also a civilian employee who routinely programs radios; he has no formal Motorola training. The MCAS Beaufort has a contract for off-base Motorola vendor support with a FST out of Florida. The lack of training is suspected to be the root cause of radio cloning problems and other operational errors in the radio programming. Table 2-14 provides a breakdown of E-LMR manpower support at MCAS Beaufort.

Maintenance/Logistics

The E-LMR system at MCAS Beaufort and MCRD Parris Island is a leased system; maintenance, with the exception of radio subscriber units, is supported through the lease. Radio assets aboard MCAS Beaufort are not supported via any maintenance contract; the S-6 was told by MCI-East via e-mail that they could no longer evacuate these assets for maintenance via MCI-East due to funding restrictions. Maintenance for MCRD Parris Island radio assets are supported through MCI-East. If MCI-East is unable to perform a one-for-one trade of the radio, then the radio is sent to Motorola for flatfee repair. This flat-fee repair service covers routine repairs on the XTS-5000/2500 portable radios for $393 and $465 for XTL-5000 mobile radios and consolettes on a per-incident, perradio basis. This fee does not cover physical or water damage to the radio; Motorola provides estimates to repair radios with physical or water damage. Motorola is discontinuing the flat-fee repair service for XTL-5000s and consolettes after March 2012.

2.2.1

Other Entities
Mutual Aid/Interoperability

The MCAS Beaufort and MCRD Parris Island share an interoperability solution. A Motorola MotoBridgeTM, located at the Master Site, connects the base first responders with the county first responders and local hospitals. The MotoBridgeTM is a hardwired connection between radios and cannot be changed via software or Graphic User Interface (GUI). The radios are linked and controlled by a laptop computer and router. The MotoBridgeTM is a standalone system. The MCAS Beaufort/MCRD Parris Island side uses XTL-2500s in the 380-399 MHz range, while Beaufort County uses XTL-2500s in the 800 MHz range. The MotoBridgeTM provides four channels for interoperability; two channels are used for daily patient transport traffic. Beaufort Memorial Hospital and the Naval Hospital use 800 MHz radios for patient transport. The MCAS Beaufort EMS uses the MotoBridgeTM to talk to both hospitals while MCRD Parris Island EMS uses 800 MHz radios. The E-LMR talkgroups connected to the hospital talkgroups are misleading; they are named "BC MCRD FD" and "BC MCRD PMO" for Beaufort County Marine Corps Recruit Depot Fire Department and Provost Marshal's Office, respectively. They were originally to be used for MCRD Parris Island interoperability with the surrounding county; however, MCRD Parris Island Fire/EMS has no connectivity with PMO or MCAS Beaufort Fire/EMS because they purchased 800 MHz radios and utilize the Beaufort County infrastructure instead of the E-LMR system. The County of Beaufort has indicated that the interoperability talkgroups are not monitored unless requested by dispatch for a specific incident. The procedure for interoperability is for the base agency requesting contact with the county to call the base dispatcher and request connectivity. The dispatcher then calls the county and is told which interoperability talkgroup to monitor. The base dispatcher then tells the base user the corresponding E-LMR talkgroup and interoperability is achieved. This guarded type of interoperability was requested by the county. Any combination of talkgroups can be used by changing the talkgroup on the radio face.

G.2. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (a) Organizational Conflict of Interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. Person as used herein includes corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business enterprises. (b) The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in the contract, the contractor does not have any organizational conflict of interest(s) as defined in paragraph (a). (c) It is recognized that the effort to be performed by the Contractor under this contract may create a potential organizational conflict of interest on the instant contract or on a future acquisition. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest, and at the same time to avoid prejudicing the best interest of the government, the right of the contractor to participate in future procurement of equipment and/or services that are the subject of any work under this contract shall be limited as described below in accordance with the requirements of FAR 9.5. (d) (1) The contractor agrees that it shall not release, disclose, or use in any way that would permit or result in disclosure to any party outside the government any information provided to the contract by the government during or as a result of performance of this contract. Such information includes, but is not limited to, information submitted to the government on confidential basis by other persons. Further, the prohibition against release of government provided information extends to cover such information whether or not in its original form, e.g., where the information has been included in contractor generated work or where it is discernible from materials incorporating or based upon such information. This prohibition shall not expire after a given period of time. (2) The contractor agrees that it shall not release, disclose, or use in any way that would permit or result in disclosure or any party outside the government any information generated or derived during or as a result of performance of this contract. This prohibition shall expire after a period of three years after completion of performance of this contract. (3) The prohibitions contained in subparagraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) shall apply with equal force to any affiliate of the contractor, any subcontractor, consultant, or employee of the contractor, any joint venture involving the contractor, any entity into or with which it may merge or affiliate, or any successor or assign of the contractor. The terms of paragraph (f) of the Special Contractor Requirement relating to notification shall apply to any release of information in contravention of this paragraph (d). (e) The contractor further agrees that during the performance of this contract and for a period of three years after completion of performance of this contract, the contractor, any affiliate of the contractor, any subcontractor, consultant, or employee of the contractor, any joint venture involving the contractor, any entity into or with which it may subsequently merge or affiliate or any other successor or assign of the contractor, shall not furnish to the United States Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor, or as a consultant to a prime contractor or as a

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 58 of 128 subcontractor, any system, component or services which is the subject of the work to be performed under this contract. This exclusion does not apply to any re-competition for those systems, components, or services on the basis of work statements growing out of the effort performed under this contract, from a source other than the contractor, subcontractor affiliate, or assign of either, during the course of performance of this contract or before the three year period following completion of this contract has lapsed, the contractor may, with the authorization of the cognizant contracting officer, participate in a subsequent procurement for the same system, component, or service. In other words, the contractor may be authorized to compete for procurement(s) for systems, components or services subsequent to an intervening procurement. (f) The contractor agrees that, if after award, it discovers an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest; it shall make immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. The notification shall include a description of the actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, a description of the action, which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict, and any other relevant information that would assist the contracting officer in making a determination on this matter. Notwithstanding this notification, the government may terminate the contract for the convenience of the government if determined to be in the best interest of the government. (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (f) above, if the contractor was aware, or should have been aware, of an organizational conflict of interest prior to the award of this contract or becomes, or should become aware of an organizational conflict or interest after award of this contract and does not make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer, the government may terminate this contract for default. (h) If the contactor takes any action prohibited by this requirement or fails to take action required by this requirement, the government my terminate this contract by default. (i) The contracting officer's decision as to the existence or nonexistence of the actual or potential organization conflict of interest shall be final and is not subject to the clause of this contract entitled "DISPUTES" (FAR 52.233.1). (j) Nothing in this requirement is intended to prohibit or preclude the contractor from marketing or selling to the United States Government its product lines in existence on the effective date of this contract; nor, shall this requirement preclude the contractor from participating in any research and development. Additionally, sale of catalog or standard commercial items are exempt from this requirement. (k) The contractor shall promptly notify the contracting officer, in writing, if it has been tasked to evaluate or advise the government concerning its own products or activities or those of a competitor in order to ensure proper safeguards exist to guarantee objectivity and to protect the government's interest. (l) The contractor shall include this requirement in subcontracts of any tier which involve access to information or situations/conditions covered by the preceding paragraphs, substituting "subcontractor" for "contactor" where appropriate. (m) The rights and remedies described herein shall not be exclusive and are in addition to other rights and remedies provided by law or elsewhere included in this contract. (n) Compliance with this requirement is a material requirement of this contract.

To expedite payment, when submitting invoices for payment the contractor is advised to check the applicable box to notify the Government point of contact electronically of an invoice submission. The vendor shall submit the invoice in WAWF after they have confirmed delivery of equipment to appropriate location. After submission of the invoice in WAWF please send a WAWF email notification to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the alternate Point of Contact (POC), if applicable, shown in Section II.b. below. This is to ensure that the invoice is certified and prompt payment is made to the vendor as requested. To send the email, click on the Send Additional Email Notifications block on the page that appears. Add the primary point of contact's email address in the first email address block and add the alternate point of contact's email address in the following block. This additional notification to the government is important to ensure the appropriate point of contact is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF-RA system. During the invoicing process, WAWF requires the vendor to enter the Contract Number (PIIN), Order Number (SPIIN) and Cage Code. No dots, dashes or spaces. The WAWF - EDA pre-population process is very dependent on accurate, reliable information. Data contained in EDA will pre-populate the vendor's WAWF document only when the PIIN, SPIIN and cage# is entered correctly. If you are having issues with the WAWF program contact TBD or the Marine Corps WAWF contact Susan Dibianca (540) 322-2897 x3210 or via email at susan.dibianca@taic.net.

H.5 NOTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT(S) OF INTEREST

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 63 of 128

The Offeror is reminded that certain existing contractual arrangements may preclude, restrict or limit participation, in whole or in part, as either a subcontractor or as a prime Contractor under this competitive procurement. Of primary concern are those existing contractual arrangements in which a Contractor provides support to programs, operations or related activities for Marine Corps Systems Command PMM 110. General guidance may be found in FAR 9.505; however, this guidance is not all inclusive. The Offeror's attention is directed to the "Organizational Conflict of Interest" (or similar) requirement which may be contained in current or completed contract(s) which prohibits the prime or subcontractor from providing certain supplies or services to the Government as described above during the period of the current "support" contract(s) or for a period after completion of the "support" contract(s). Notwithstanding the existence or non-existence of an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause or similar requirement in current or completed contract(s), the Offeror shall comply with FAR 9.5 and identify whether an OCI exists and not rely solely on the presence of an OCI requirement. Offerors should review their existing contractual arrangements to determine whether they believe a potential conflict of interest exists, at any tier. If an Offeror believes a potential conflict of interest exists, the Offeror is required to notify the Contracting Officer within seven (7) calendar days of the date of this solicitation. The Offeror shall provide at this time: (1) the contract number and name and phone number of the Contracting Officer for the contract which gives rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest; (2) a copy of the requirement; (3) the statement of work (or technical instruction) from the existing contract; (4) a brief description of the type of work to be performed by each subcontractor under the competitive procurement; (5) a proposed mitigation plan; (6) and any additional information the Contracting Officer should consider in making a determination of whether a conflict of interest exists. The Government may independently verify the information received from the Contractor. Notwithstanding the above, the Government reserves the right to determine whether a conflict of interest exists based on any information received from any source. Any Offeror who is determined to have an Organizational Conflict of Interest that cannot, in the Government's opinion, be mitigated, will be deemed ineligible to participate in the current competition and will have their proposal rejected. The Government will notify an Offeror of any conflict of interest within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of all required information. Those Offerors deemed to have a conflict of interest may be ineligible for award. Failure to provide the information in a timely manner does not waive the Government's rights to make a conflict of interest determination. The Offeror is notified that proposal preparation and any expenditure is at its own risk and will not be reimburesed by the Government if it is determined that an organizational conflict of interest exists. Any Offeror that proposes a subcontractor later determined to have a conflict of interest and deemed ineligible to participate in the current competition, may not be granted the opportunity to revise its proposal to remove the ineligible subcontractor. The Government reserves the right to determine which Offerors continue as part of the evaluation through the normal source selection process. If the Offeror determines that a potential organizational conflict of interest does not exist at any tier, the Offeror shall include a statement to that effect in its Executive Summary in response to this solicitation.

To demonstrate past performance, the Offeror shall identify a minimum of three (3) of its most relevant contracts or efforts performed for Federal, State, County, or Municipal agencies or commercial customers within the past five (5) years, and provide any other information the Offeror considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Offerors should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation. Relevant contracts include E-LMR system installation, service implementation and integration of three (3) or more of the proposed products. Relevance is demonstrated by similarity in product base, prior subcontractor partnerships/teaming agreements, size, scope, complexity, and cost/price. The contracts or efforts will be considered in the aggregate to demonstrate experience with the full scope, magnitude, and complexity of the ERI requirement.. Ensure that accurate and concise information is provided for each reference including: (a) Title of Contract, Contract Number, and Sponsoring Organization. (b) Type of Contract, Contract Value, Award and Completion Date. (c) Brief description of the services performed, problems identified and corrective action taken, awards/recognition received.

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 73 of 128 These previous contracting efforts shall be for work done by the prime and subcontractors. For each contract effort, identify the Program Manager (PM) and the Contracting Officer Representative. Provide the current address, phone number, and email address for each customer POC. The Government may use past performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the Offeror. Past performance information can be obtained from any other sources available to the Government..These sources may include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with PMs, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. Part V: Price Proposal. Section 1. Pricing Information. The Offeror shall provide pricing information in Attachment 12, Price Summary. All CLINs including Option CLINs shall be priced. The Offeror shall include sufficient detail with the price proposal. Proposal backup shall include high-level labor manning, labor categories and hours, material and equipment cost. Price proposal shall be entered on the spreadsheet file, Attachment 12, readable in MS Office Excel format. Offerors shall not alter the format of the spreadsheets except that column(s) and row(s) may be widened or added as needed. The Offeror shall provide an individually priced list of all hardware/software to include price per item, quantity of item, and total price, see Attachment 12 to RFP. The contracting officer must be able to determine that all aspects of the requirements have been considered in the proposal and that the price is justifiable for the work required (i.e., "reasonable"). Section 2. Price Breakout. An Offeror's proposal is presumed to represent its best efforts to respond to the solicitation. Any inconsistency between performance, the technical proposal, identified personnel resources and cost/price must be explained in the proposal. For example, if the intended use of new and innovative techniques is the basis for an abnormally low estimate, the nature of these techniques and their impact on cost or price shall be explained; or, if a corporate policy decision has been made to absorb a portion of the estimated cost, that must be stated in the proposal. Any inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental question of the Offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of the work required and may adversely affect the Offeror's standing upon evaluation. The burden of proof as to cost credibility rests with the Offeror. Unreasonably low prices may indicate an inability to understand requirements or a high-risk approach to task order performance. Accordingly, the Government may consider the findings of such an analysis in evaluating an Offeror's ability to perform and the risk of its approach. Part VI: Contract Information. Section 1. Completed and Signed SF 1449. The offeror shall include a completed SF1449, properly executed and signed by an official authorized to commit the offeror. The submission of all of the items in accordance with the instructions will, upon acceptance by the Government, contractually bind the Government and the Offeror to the terms and conditions of the model task order.

Subcontracting/Commercial Plan (Large Businesses). A Subcontracting Plan must be submitted by all Large Business Offerors. Failure to submit a Plan may result in the offerors proposal being UNACCEPTABLE. Offerors may submit previously approved Commercial Plans, but the Government reserves the right to in accordance with DFARS 219.705-4 challenge any plan that doesn't include positive goals. In addition, the offeror shall submit a Subcontracting/Commercial Plan including assurances that the Offeror will (1) submit the Individual Subcontracting Plan (ISP) and Summary Subcontracting Reports (SSR) under the eSRS and (2) ensure that its subcontractors agree to submit ISPs and SSRs at all tiers in the eSRS.

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 74 of 128 Section 4. Section 508 Deliverable Requirements.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 97 of 128 (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: See addendum below: 52.212-2 Addendum Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions. Each Offeror's proposal shall contain the Offeror's best price and technical position. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later deemed necessary. Any Offeror that is rated Unacceptable in any evaluation criterion will not be considered for contract award. In order to be considered responsive to this RFP, the Offeror's proposal MUST meet all Marine Corps Systems Command and PWS requirements. Unsupported promises to comply with the contractual requirements will not be sufficient. The Government may award to other than the lowest-priced Offeror or to other than the Offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. The Government intends to award a single FFP, contract resulting from this RFP: (a) Whose proposal is technically acceptable. (b) Whose offer is deemed responsive to the solicitation requirement. (c) Who overall offer represents Best Value to the Government. In making its Trade Off determination, the Government will consider all non-price factors, combined, to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price. However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals. Evaluation Areas and Factors

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 107 of 128

General. The Government will apply the following evaluation factors and elements to identify the best value proposal. The evaluation factors represent key areas of importance to be considered in the source selection decision. The factors and elements have been chosen to support meaningful discrimination between and among competing proposals. The proposals will be evaluated against the Government's requirements using five factors. Technical Approach, Management Approach and Sustainment Approach are of equal importance, and are more important than Past Performance. Technical Approach, Management Approach, Sustainment Approach and Past Performance, when taken together are significantly more important than Price. Factor 1 ­ Technical Approach Factor 2 ­ Management Approach Factor 3 ­ Sustainment Approach Factor 4 ­ Past Performance Information Factor 5 ­ Price Proposal (evaluated but not rated) Procedures. The Price Volume will be evaluated separately from the Technical Volume, but not rated. An adjectival rating and risk assessment will be used to establish technical merit and performance risk for the Technical Volume. Adjectival Rating: The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will use four (4) adjectival ratings of Exceptional, Acceptable, Marginal, and Unacceptable for the Technical Approach, Management Approach and Sustainment Approach. The proposal rating depicts how well the Offeror's proposal meets the evaluation standards and the solicitation requirements. Technical Approach, Management Approach and Sustainment Approach Ratings: The ratings to be used for Technical Approach, Management Approach and are: Rating Performance Capability The proposal exceeds solicitation requirements and clearly demonstrates the Offeror's capability to deliver exceptional performance The proposal is satisfactory; the Offeror is capable of meeting solicitation requirements. Strengths Weaknesses

Exceptional

There are numerous strengths that are of direct benefit to the Government. Some strengths exist that are of benefit to the Government; the strengths clearly offset weaknesses. Few strengths exist that are of benefit to the Government; the strengths do not offset the weaknesses.

Weaknesses are considered insignificant and have no apparent impact to the program.

Acceptable

A few weaknesses exist; they are correctable with minimal Government oversight or direction. Substantial weaknesses exist that may affect the program; they are correctable with some Government oversight and direction.

Marginal

The proposal is minimally adequate; the Offeror is most likely able to meet solicitation requirements.

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 108 of 128 Rating Performance Capability The proposal is highly inadequate; the Offeror cannot meet solicitation requirements. Strengths Weaknesses Numerous weaknesses exist that are so significant that a proposal re-write is not feasible within a suitable timeframe.

Unacceptable

There are no beneficial strengths.

Risk Assessment Ratings: The risk assessment ratings are: Rating Definition Offeror's proposed approach is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance and will require a high level of contractor emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties. Offeror's proposed approach is likely to cause a moderate disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance and will require a medium level of contractor emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties. Offeror's proposed approach is likely to cause minimal or no disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance and will require a low level of contractor emphasis and Government monitoring to overcome difficulties.

High

Moderate

Low

Past Performance Information: The Government will identify and assess the relevancy and confidence associated with an Offeror's Past Performance Information: Rating Definition Present/past performance effort involved the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. This includes examples of integration of all products proposed for E-LMR, Federal IA requirements, integration with legacy equipment, multi-team/multi-site employments. Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

The Government will evaluate the three (3) summaries of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal, State, County, or Municipal agencies or commercial customers within the last five (5) years. Relevant contracts include LMR system installations.

M67854-13-R-4950 Page 112 of 128 The past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the governments risk in the offeror's ability to fulfi ll the solicitation requirements while meeting schedule, budget and performance quality constraints. The past performance evaluation considers the offeror's demonstrated record of performance in supplying products and services that meet users' needs. The past performance evaluation will concentrate on assessing the delivery of an offeror's products and/or services and be tailored to the Technical factors, cost factor and other solicitation requirements that if not successfully accomplished could result in disruption of schedule, increased cost or poor performance. Factor 5­ Price The price proposed by the Offeror will be evaluated, but not rated. The Contracting Officer will perform a price proposal analysis to determine fair and reasonable pricing. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to reject an offer if it is determined that the lack of balanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government in accordance with FAR Part 15.404-1(g). The proposed price to the Government must be compatible with the technical portion of the offer. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

For DoD, a consolidated report shall be submitted for all contracts awarded by military departments/agencies and/or subcontracts awarded by DoD prime Contractors. However, for construction and related maintenance and repair, a separate report shall be submitted for each DoD component. (D) For DoD and NASA, the report shall be submitted semi-annually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30. For civilian agencies, except NASA, it shall be submitted annually for the twelve month period ending September 30. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period. (E) Subcontract awards that are related to work for more than one executive agency shall be appropriately allocated. (F) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs in eSRS, including SSRs submitted by subcontractors with subcontracting plans, resides with the Government agency awarding the prime contracts unless stated otherwise in the contract. (ii) Reports submitted under a commercial plan-(A) The report shall include all subcontract awards under the commercial plan in effect during the Government's fiscal year. (B) The report shall be submitted annually, within thirty days after the end of the Government's fiscal year. (C) If a Contractor has a commercial plan and is performing work for more than one executive agency, the Contractor shall specify the percentage of dollars attributable to each agency from which contracts for commercial items were received. (D) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs for commercial plans resides with the Contracting Officer who approved the commercial plan. (iii) All reports submitted at the close of each fiscal year (both individual and commercial plans) shall include a Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses. The report shall include subcontract awards, in whole dollars, to small disadvantaged business concerns by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector. If the data are not available when the year-end SSR is submitted, the prime Contractor and/or subcontractor shall submit the Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses within 90 days of submitting the year-end SSR. For a commercial plan, the Contractor may obtain from each of its subcontractors a predominant NAICS Industry Subsector and report all awards to that subcontractor under its predominant NAICS Industry Subsector.
