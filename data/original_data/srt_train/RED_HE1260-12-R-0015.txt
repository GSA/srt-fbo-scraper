(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

HE1260-12-R-0015 Page 32 of 40

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

52.212-2

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the lowest price, technically acceptable offer. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: TECHNICAL FACTOR The Government will evaluate the offeror's Technical Narrative, List of Materials, and proposed Installation Plan to determine the offeror's understanding of the technical requirements and the ability to accomplish the technical requirements within the period of performance by reviewing how the offeror addressed the information required in the submittal section. Technical proposals will be evaluated to assess whether the offeror's proposal will satisfy the Government's minimum requirements and to determine whether the proposal is "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" using the ratings and descriptions below: ACCEPTABLE The proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. UNACCEPTABLE The proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR The Government will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance as they relate to the offeror's capability to perform contracted work; on-site management and coordination of work requirements; cooperative nature, integrity and reasonableness; ability to meet performance schedules; quality of work; ability to mitigate problems; and compliance with document safeguarding and security procedures and requirements. Past Performance will be rated on an "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" basis using the ratings below: ACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below). UNACCEPTABLE Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."

HE1260-12-R-0015 Page 40 of 40 PRICE EVALUATION FACTOR 1) The Government will evaluate the total price proposed for the contract. 2) Price evaluation will not be based on absolute standards or given an adjectival rating. 3) The Government will evaluate the price proposals to ensure a fair and reasonable price by using one or more of the following price analysis techniques: a) Comparison of price proposals to solicitation requirements so that price reflects all the associated costs; b) Comparison of prices to all other price proposals; c) Analysis of price for unbalanced items or offers: price is acceptable in relation to market prices; d) Identification of areas considered unreasonably high or low. *Please note the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)
