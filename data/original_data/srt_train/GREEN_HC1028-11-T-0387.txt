52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

(a)  An offeror shall identify in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, any potential or actual Organizational and Consultant
Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) as described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  This includes actual or potential conflicts of interests of proposed
subcontractors.  If an offeror identifies in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, a potential or actual conflict of interests the
offeror shall submit an Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest Plan (OCCIP) to the contracting officer.  The OCCIP shall describe
how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future
conflicts of interest.

(b)  Offerors must consider whether their involvement and participation raises any OCCI issues, especially in the following areas when:

     (1)  Providing systems engineering and technical direction.

     (2)  Preparing specifications or work statements and/or objectives.

     (3)  Providing evaluation services.

concerning its conflict of interest, the government may take appropriate action, including terminating the contract, in additional to any
remedies that may be otherwise permitted by the contract or operation of law.

                                                                 (End of clause)

SECTION 508
Section 508 Requirements

      a.  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies acquiring Electronic and Information
      Technology (EIT) to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to
      the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.


      b.  All EIT procured under this contract/order must meet the following 36 CFR     1194 accessibility standards.  The full text of the
      accessibility standards is available at: http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm


            _x_ 1194.21 – Software Applications and Operating Systems
           ___ 1194.22 – Web Based Intranet and Internet Information and
                       Applications
            ___ 1194.23 – Telecommunications Products
            ___ 1194.24 – Video and Multimedia
            ___ 1194.25 – Self-Contained, Closed Products
            ___ 1194.26 – Desktop and Portable Computers
            _x_ 1194.31 – Functional Performance Criteria

      c.  The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology
      device(s), but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and device(s) so that it can be made accessible if so required
      in the future.


      d.  Contractors may propose products or services that result in substantially equivalent or greater access to and use by individuals with
      disabilities; this is known as equivalent facilitation.
