SECTION C ­ DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICCATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK C.1 STATEMENT OF WORK A. Introduction Under this contract, the contractor shall provide thorough, current, and timely summary and compilation of news stories along with an archive that is searchable by keyword and date. The contractor services shall include a daily news briefing/summary offering staff a thorough, current and timely compilation of news stories relevant to the agency's mission with an archive that is searchable by keyword and date. The services shall also provide social media measurement services to aid in accessing the agency's social media position. B. Background As stated in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Management Directive 5.5, Public Affairs Program, the NRC Office of Public Affairs (OPA) staff is required to "keep NRC management advised of public interest in proposed policies, programs, and projects so that public affairs actions may be developed and executed effectively, and to inform NRC decisionmaking." Further, "[OPA] informs senior NRC management of media coverage of interest to the agency. [OPA] provides to the Chairman, the Commission, the EDO, and senior management-- (a) Early advice on public affairs strategies to deal effectively with the public on issues of interest; and (b) Information on external activities that may affect NRC interests." NRC officials and staff must start each day fully informed about local, regional, national and international news that is of interest to, or could impact, the NRC. The NRC has been using an electronic news retrieval service and will continue to require the service going forward. Additionally, as the NRC's social media presence has grown, and as social media increasingly is used as an information source by the public, the need for the agency to monitor and measure social media has also increased. C. Objective The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform electronic news retrieval, news summary creation by human editor and social media data collection services as defined in this Statement of Work, except for those items specified as Government-furnished property and services. The objective is to provide a thorough, current, and timely narrative summary and compilation of news stories, with a searchable archive, as well as a social media dashboard. D. Scope of Work Electronic News Summary NRC requires an electronic news monitoring and retrieval service that creates a list of topics in a table of contents, a human-written and human-edited daily summary of each identified news article, that provides a link to the actual print and broadcast news stories that are summarized, and, additionally, provides the full text of the news articles. The average briefing packet consists of approximately five pages of narrative and a table of contents, not including the full text of all the articles. 6

There is an average of 50 individual daily clippings both foreign and domestic each day on an average of 25 different topics that are used for the electronic news monitoring. The human editor using professional judgment must review the articles to ensure relevance, eliminate redundancies and write a summary of each, grouped by topic. The summary must include links and should provide enough context that readers can quickly grasp the general content and tone of the article. Articles that don't have substantially different content can be characterized in the summary with just a link. Each article, however, must be listed individually in the package. The contractor will not be required to summarize a subset of articles. The contractor shall find and review articles and broadcasts from all major (and most smaller) daily newspapers, national and local television, newsweeklies, magazines and journals, internet sites, specialty press, international news sources covering nuclear activities and blogs. This includes national, regional and local coverage, wire services and key international Englishlanguage media outlets including international wire services, as well as relevant blogs, magazines, and trade or specialty press. This shall not only include online publications of daily news but also relevant stories found in the hardcopy outlets. The contractor shall conduct the search for relevant articles using keywords and other means to identify news on topics directly related to the NRC, the nuclear industry both domestic and foreign, and other related ctopics of interest such as energy, the environment, labor, the federal government, emergency response, cybersecurity, etc. The contractor may need to adjust keywords and search queries to reflect current events. The news in the daily briefing package must be current, occurring in the preceding 24 hours, and there should be a very low incidence of missed or day-old stories. The contractor shall respond to email follow-up from the agency for missed clips or other issues within one hour. When links point to content on subscription-based sites, the NRC may at its discretion subscribe. For broadcast stories in which reviewing the actual audio/video would be particularly useful, the contractor shall provide a link to available "video clips" that stream to the reader's desktop. The contractor shall quickly accommodate changes to the package based on the changing needs of the NRC, including adding missed news clips, last minute changes to topics to be covered, deadlines, and the format of the package. The contractor shall also be flexible to respond to occasional special requests from OPA to provide news clips on a fast-breaking event that impacts the NRC. (Note: This is a rare occurrence, however, the capability to quickly expand must exist.) The contractor shall also cover news of interest of the NRC. News of interest to the NRC means all coverage from the sources impacting the nuclear regulatory activities of the NRC including but not limited to regulation and guidance-rulemaking, policymaking, licensing, decommissioning, certification, research, oversight and enforcement, security, and emergency preparedness and response. In addition to news around the NRC, the news summary shall mention other topics programs and policies outside of those that either explicitly mention the NRC or directly relate to the agency's regulatory activities. For example, the contractor shall include articles regarding international nuclear matters, articles that involve other government entities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whose regulations, policies and / or activities may impact operations at the NRC, stories that involve a topic that impacts all federal employees but does not pertain to nuclear activities (i.e. government 7

shutdown) and articles about security and radiation. The audience is all NRC employees, approximately 4,000 individual readers. The news summary must be posted to an IP-protected address accessible through the agency's Intranet by 7 a.m. during federal work days and sent via email to identified key officials. The summary must include news from weekends and Federal holidays in the next issue of the briefing. The IP-protected website shall encompass a secure site-to site virtual private network for secure communication over the Internet, following the guidance provided by the National Institute of Technology under Special Publication 800-11 3, Guide to SSL VPNs for NRC review and approval. The offeror shall also propose an enclave with the appropriate isolation from other customers and within their corporate network to show an acceptable level of security and establish network trust between the contractor and the NRC enclaves. All encryption capability proposed, either in software, firmware or hardware must have use cryptographic algorithms tested and validated against the criteria established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 requirement, accompanied with validation certificate(s) located on the NIST validation library. The contractor shall supply the ability for NRC staff to open and read the briefing/summary on the computer screen and print them from the screen. The briefing/summary shall be printable in Microsoft Word and Adobe .pdf formats. Electronic News Summary Archives The contractor shall ensure that all briefing packages (entire daily reports) are archived and searchable by date and keyword. The contractor shall archive in in such a way that people can view the entire report of any past day. The contractor shall ensure that the archive remains viable for the life of the contract. At the end of the contract, the contractor shall deliver the archive to the COR in a format (such as Microsoft Word or Adobe .pdf) that NRC can keep inhouse on an internal NRC site or directory for use by NRC employees. Social Media Dashboard The contractor shall provide a social media electronic dashboard that collects and displays social media statistics according to relevant factors, such as frequency, audience size and source i.e. Twitter, Facebook, blog. The social media dashboard shall provide individual log ins to not more than six selected NRC staff from the Office of Public Affairs. The contractor shall update the dashboard daily (on federal work days) by 9 a.m., with data related to social media mentions of the NRC and related topics, and the identified audience and reach. The dashboard will be made available through a secure link. The dashboard shall allow for the NRC to run customized reports of its own choosing. The contractor shall not analyze the data nor to engage on social media on behalf of the agency. The contractor shall also provide initial orientation and training regarding use of the dashboard development of customized reports to not more than six NRC employees. Specific room, date and locations will be coordinated between the contractor and the COR after contract award.

8

E. Deliverables 1. The contractor shall provide a daily news briefing/summary by 7:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on weekdays except on Federal holidays. The contractor shall provide news clips on fast-breaking events that impact the NRC on an as-needed basis. The contactor shall provide an archive of daily news briefings/summaries. 2. The contractor shall provide a social media dashboard that is populated daily by 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on weekdays except Federal Holidays. The platform shall be in electronic format with the capability of downloading/printing relevant customized reports. F. Place of Performance The place of performance is at the contractor's discretion. NRC does not intend to provide any space for the contractor. G. Meetings The contractor shall attend a post award (kick off meeting) conference convened by the contracting officer. This meeting shall take place at NRC Headquarters located in Rockville, MD. Specific room, date and locations will be provided to the contractor after contract award. The meeting shall take place not later than two weeks after contract award. The CO, CORs, and other Government personnel, as appropriate, may request meetings (which will take place via conference calls) with the contractor to review the contractor's performance. These will occur only when necessary, and not more than monthly. At these meetings the CO will apprise the contractor of how the government views the contractor's performance and the contractor will apprise the Government of problems, if any, being experienced. Appropriate action shall be taken to resolve outstanding issues. These meetings shall be at no additional cost to the Government. The contractor may request meetings whenever a discrepancy exists and no mutual resolution is apparent. H. Section 508 ­ Electronic and Information Technology Standards In December 2000, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board), pursuant to Section 508(2)(A) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, established information technology accessibility standards for the federal government. Section 508(a)(1) requires that when federal departments or agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), they shall ensure that the EIT allows federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal employees. The Section 508 requirement also applies to members of the public seeking information or services from a federal department or agency. Section 508 text is available at http://www.opm.gov/HTML/508-textOfLaw.htm or http://www.section508.gov/ All Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), as defined at FAR 2.101, supplied under this contract/order must conform to the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194). The applicable standards are available at: http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/index.htm The following standards are applicable to this contract: 9

1. Software applications and operating systems (if applicable, such as when a web browser plug-in is used) (1194.21) 2. Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications (1194.22) 3. Functional performance criteria 1194.31 4. Information, Documentation and Support (1194.41) Because the Section 508 accessibility standards currently do not provide specific technical guidance on what constitutes an accessible electronic document, you shall use the guidance found at http://www.socialsecurity.gov/accessibility/developer_resources.html to author Word and PDF documents for accessibility.

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001 SECTION F ­ CONTRACT CLAUSES F.1 52.204-13 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT MAINTENANCE. (JUL 2013) (a) Definitions. As used in this clauseData Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors. Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern. Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database; (2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database; (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and (4) The Government has marked the record "Active". System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government; (2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and (3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits. (b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate 13

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001 or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to(A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun & Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun & Bradstreet may be contacted(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001 of non-competitive proposals and task orders. (b) There [ ] are [ ] are no current/former NRC employees (including special Government employees performing services as experts, advisors, consultants, or members of advisory committees) who have been or will be involved, directly or indirectly, in developing the offer, or in negotiating on behalf of the offeror, or in managing, administering, or performing any contract, consultant agreement, or subcontract resulting from this offer.

F.13 2052.209-71 CONTRACTOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (REPRESENTATION).

(a) If the representation, as completed, indicates that situations or relationships of the type set forth in 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b) are involved, or the contracting officer otherwise determines that potential organizational conflicts of interest exist, the offeror shall provide a statement in writing that describes in a concise manner all relevant factors bearing on his representation to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer determines that organizational conflicts exist, the following actions may be taken: (1) Impose appropriate conditions which avoid such conflicts; (2) Disqualify the offeror; or (3) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions of 48 CFR 2009-570-9. (b) The refusal to provide the representation required by 48 CFR 2009.570-4(b), or upon request of the contracting officer, the facts required by 48 CFR 2009.570-3(b), must result in disqualification of the offeror for award. F.14 2052.209-72 CONTRACTOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. (JAN 1993) (a) Purpose. The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that the contractor: (1) Is not placed in a conflicting role because of current or planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to the work under this contract; and (2) Does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described apply to performance or participation by the contractor, as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2 in the activities covered by this clause. 47

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001 (c) Work for others. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, during the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to forego entering into consulting or other contractual arrangements with any firm or organization the result of which may give rise to a conflict of interest with respect to the work being performed under this contract. The contractor shall ensure that all employees under this contract abide by the provision of this clause. If the contractor has reason to believe, with respect to itself or any employee, that any proposed consultant or other contractual arrangement with any firm or organization may involve a potential conflict of interest, the contractor shall obtain the written approval of the contracting officer before the execution of such contractual arrangement. (2) The contractor may not represent, assist, or otherwise support an NRC licensee or applicant undergoing an NRC audit, inspection, or review where the activities that are the subject of the audit, inspection, or review are the same as or substantially similar to the services within the scope of this contract (or task order as appropriate) except where the NRC licensee or applicant requires the contractor's support to explain or defend the contractor's prior work for the utility or other entity which NRC questions. (3) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, the contractor shall neither solicit nor perform work in the same or similar technical area for that licensee or applicant organization for a period commencing with the award of the task order or beginning of work on the site (if not a task order contract) and ending one year after completion of all work under the associated task order, or last time at the site (if not a task order contract). (4) When the contractor performs work for the NRC under this contract at any NRC licensee or applicant site, (i) The contractor may not solicit work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate. (ii) The contractor may not perform work at that site for that licensee or applicant during the period of performance of the task order or the contract, as appropriate, and for one year thereafter. (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to solicit or perform this type of work (except work in the same or similar technical area) if the contracting officer determines that the situation will not pose a potential for technical bias or unfair competitive advantage. (d) Disclosure after award. (1) The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in this contract, that it does not have any organizational conflicts of interest as defined in 48 CFR 2009.570-2. (2) The contractor agrees that if, after award, it discovers organizational conflicts of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This statement must include a description of the action which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts. The NRC may, 48

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001 however, terminate the contract if termination is in the best interest of the Government. (3) It is recognized that the scope of work of a task-order-type contract necessarily encompasses a broad spectrum of activities. Consequently, if this is a task-order-type contract, the contractor agrees that it will disclose all proposed new work involving NRC licensees or applicants which comes within the scope of work of the underlying contract. Further, if this contract involves work at a licensee or applicant site, the contractor agrees to exercise diligence to discover and disclose any new work at that licensee or applicant site. This disclosure must be made before the submission of a bid or proposal to the utility or other regulated entity and must be received by the NRC at least 15 days before the proposed award date in any event, unless a written justification demonstrating urgency and due diligence to discover and disclose is provided by the contractor and approved by the contracting officer. The disclosure must include the solicitation Statement of Work, the dollar value of the proposed contract, and any other documents that are needed to fully describe the proposed work for the regulated utility or other regulated entity. NRC may deny approval of the disclosed work only when the NRC has issued a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or has plans to issue a task order which includes the technical area and, if site-specific, the site, or when the work violates paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section.

(2) In addition, the contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. Section 552a (1988)), or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552 (1986)), or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information under this contract, the contractor shall treat the information in accordance with restrictions placed on use of the information.

(1) If the contractor under this contract, prepares a complete or essentially complete solicitation Statement of Work or specifications, the contractor is not eligible to perform or participate in the initial contractual effort which is based on the solicitation Statement of Work or specifications. The contractor may not incorporate its products or services in the solicitation Statement of Work or specifications unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, in which case the restrictions in this paragraph do not apply. (2) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the contractor from offering or selling its standard commercial items to the Government. F.15 2052.215-70 KEY PERSONNEL.

(d) If the contracting officer determines that suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not reasonably forthcoming, or that the resultant reduction of productive effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of the contract or the service order, the contract may be terminated by the contracting officer for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate. If the contracting officer finds the contractor at fault for the condition, the contract price or fixed fee may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any resultant delay, loss, or damage. F.16 2052.222-70 NONDISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF AGE (JAN 1993) It is the policy of the Executive Branch of the Government that: (a) Contractors and subcontractors engaged in the performance of Federal contracts may not, in connection with the employment, advancement, or discharge of employees or in connection with the terms, conditions, or privileges of their employment, discriminate against persons because of their age except upon the basis of a bona fide occupational qualification, retirement plan, or statutory requirements; and (b) That contractors and subcontractors, or persons acting on their behalf, may not specify, in solicitations or advertisements for employees to work on Government contracts, a maximum age limit for employment unless the specified maximum age limit is based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, retirement plan, or statutory requirement. F.17 NRCH310 ANNUAL AND FINAL CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS Annual and final evaluations of contractor performance under this contract will be prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 42.15, "Contractor Performance Information," normally at or near the time the contractor is notified of the NRC's intent to exercise the contract option. If the multiyear contract does not have option years, then an annual evaluation will be prepared [Insert time for annual evaluation here]. Final evaluations of contractor performance will be prepared at the expiration of the contract during the contract closeout process. The Contracting Officer will transmit the NRC Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) annual and final contractor performance evaluations to the contractor's Project Manager, unless otherwise instructed by the contractor. The contractor will be permitted thirty days to review the document and submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information. Where a contractor concurs with, or takes no exception to an annual performance evaluation, the Contracting Officer will consider such evaluation final and releasable for source selection purposes. Disagreements between the parties regarding a performance evaluation will be referred to an individual one level above the Contracting Officer, whose decision will be final. The Contracting Officer will send a copy of the completed evaluation report, marked "Source Selection Information", to the contractor's Project Manager for their records as soon as practicable after it has been finalized. The completed evaluation report also will be used as a tool to improve communications between the NRC and the contractor and to improve contract performance. 51

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001

The completed annual performance evaluation will be used to support future award decisions in accordance with FAR 42.1502 and 42.1503. During the period the information is being used to provide source selection information, the completed annual performance evaluation will be released to only two parties - the Federal government personnel performing the source selection evaluation and the contractor under evaluation if the contractor does not have a copy of the report already. F.18 NRCH340 COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS NRC contractors are responsible to ensure that their alien personnel are not in violation of United States immigration laws and regulations, including employment authorization documents and visa requirements. Each alien employee of the Contractor must be lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by Permanent Resident Form I-551 (Green Card), or must present other evidence from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that employment will not affect his/her immigration status.

(e) The contractor shall immediately provide the contracting officer written notice of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI over the contractor which would affect the answers to the questions presented in SF-328, "Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interest". Further, notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice shall also be furnished concurrently to the contracting officer. (f) In those cases where a contractor has changes involving FOCI, the NRC must determine whether the changes will pose an undue risk to the common defense and security. In making this determination, the contracting officer shall consider proposals made by the contractor to avoid or mitigate foreign influences. (g) The contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause including this paragraph (g) in all subcontracts under this contract that will require access to classified information and shall require such subcontractors to submit completed SF-328, DD441 and DD-441-1 forms prior to award of a subcontract. Information to be provided by a subcontractor pursuant to this clause may be submitted directly to the contracting officer. (h) Information submitted by the contractor or any affected subcontractor as required pursuant to this clause shall be treated by NRC to the extent permitted by law, as business or financial information submitted in confidence to be used solely for purposes of evaluating FOCI. (i) The requirements of this clause are in addition to the requirement that a contractor obtain and retain the security clearances required by the contract. This clause shall not operate as a limitation on NRC's rights, including its rights to terminate this contract. (j) The contracting officer may terminate this contract for default either if the contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause, e.g., provide the information required by this clause, comply with the contracting officer's instructions about safeguarding classified information, or make this clause applicable to subcontractors, or if, in the contracting officer's judgment, the contractor creates a FOCI situation in order to avoid performance or a 53

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001 termination for default.

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001 SECTION H - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, listed in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) TECHNICAL APPROACH
The Government will evaluate the adequacy of the offeror's proposed technical approach to meet the solicitation requirements. In this evaluation, the Government will consider the entirety of the offeror's proposed technical approach, including the offeror's detailed proposed approach (including sources and time line) for obtaining the news articles and drafting/editing/reviewing the news summaries to meet the daily 7:00 a.m. deadline. As part of the Technical Approach factor, the Government will also evaluate, on a pass-fail basis, whether at least 50% of the performance cost will be incurred by the offeror's own employees as required by the clause at FAR 52.219-14. Also as part of the Technical Approach factor, the Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed approach for ensuring that Section 508 standards are met or exceeded with respect to the proposed interface and the content of the electronicnews summary, and the extent to which the offeror's Government Protduct Accessibility Template reflects that the proposed solution meets or exceeds Section 508 standards. The Government will consider the quality of the offeror's written proposal ­ especially its sample news summary ­ as being representative of the quality of the product the Government can expect to receive if the offeror is awarded the contract. A proposal's use of excessive marking material not tailored to the specific solicitation requirements will be considered as bearing on the offeror's understanding of the requirements and ability to follow instructions.

(2) CORPORATE EXPERIENCE The Government will evaluate the offeror's corporate experience performing work that is similar in scope to this procurement. If the offeror proposes to use a subcontractor, the Government may consider corporate experience of proposed subcontractor(s) in evaluating corporate experience. (3) PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS The Government will evaluate the qualifications of the offeror's proposed personnel. For any resume for a contingent hire that does not include a signed letter of commitment, the Government may determine that to constitute a deficiency in the proposal. (4) PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information to assess how well the offeror performed on contracts similar in size and scope to this procurement that were performed or completed within the past three (3) years. In performing this evaluation, the Government will consider any relevant Past Performance Information questionnaires received, may contact some or all of the references provided, and may consider other past performance information obtained from any other source.

91

SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-7K-14-R-0001

If no relevant past performance information is identified by the offeror, or if the Government is unsuccessful in obtaining past performance feedback for the offeror from applicable references or sources, then the Government would assign a neutral rating for Past Performance Information. (5) PRICE The four non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. After evaluating all proposals, if the contracting officer determines that the number of proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) As part of the price evaluation, the Government will evaluate the option to extend services under the clause at FAR 52.217-8 by adding six months of the Offeror's price for the last potential period of performance under this contract to the Offeror's total price. For example, if the contract includes option periods that are exercisable under FAR 52.217-9, the Offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, all option periods, and an additional six months of the last option period. Offerors must price only the base and option periods specified in the contract line item numbers (CLINs), and shall not submit a price for the potential six-month extension of services under FAR 52.217-8 (d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
