SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
C. 1 STATEMENT OF WORK

DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) OVERVIEW OPIC has recently completed a messaging and branding exercise and the agency is now seeking a communications partner to assist in the outbound execution of that work under a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract. We are conducting this RFP in pursuit of a partner with deep experience in web development, content development, design, social media including simple video production work, and public relations in order to enable a holistic approach to execution of our communications program. As a starting point, the selected partner will support us in the development of a new agency website, design and possible content development on the annual report and quarterly newsletter, on-going social media and media relations support. REQUIRED SERVICES A. NEW WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT: (Work should begin upon signing of contract and plan for revamp should be completed within three months. Total scope of web development work will not exceed 18 months, although contractor must provide technical support for four years. 1) Creative Brand Platform Working with the OPIC marketing team, the chosen vendor will develop the creative brand platform for OPIC's communication vehicles, beginning with the website. This creative platform will serve to ensure that OPIC delivers a consistent look and feel across its various communications vehicles including its website, annual report, quarterly newsletter, etc. (Note that this platform may be developed as part of the web site creation process). The typography, color palette, and supporting brand imagery such as graphic details, photography or illustration will be defined. This creative platform will serve as the foundation for the OPIC site, and over time, used in the implementation of all OPIC communication vehicles, including interactive content, collateral, presentations, etc. 2) Creative Website Execution Leveraging the brand platform, and working on a Drupal platform, a new OPIC.gov will be created. The site will consist of approximately 35-50 HTML pages (plus downloadable PDF pages), along with a content management system that allows for the creation of additional pages in the same style of existing website pages. Website must be compatible with major Internet browsers including but not limited to Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox. The site is likely to include, but is not limited to, the following pages: Homepage Mission Highlighted Case Study Latest News & Events Interactive map or some other unifying homepage feature that serves as a portal into other parts of the website. ˇ What we do o Our Mission o Our People o Our Investment Policy o Doing Business with Us o Our Impact ˇ What we offer o Small Business o Renewables o Middle East/North Africa o Etc. ˇ OPIC in action o Case Studies (up to 5) o Project vignettes o Other timely initiatives ˇ Resources o Introductory copy to publications o Introductory copy to Required documents (PDFs to government mandated content) o Fact Sheets and/or FAQs o Photo Gallery
PAGE 5 OF 25 OPIC-11-R-0034

ˇ o o o o

o Sorting of Content by Region and Industry (and perhaps, product line) o Video (Support creating short videos spotlighting OPIC's work) 3) Content Development (24 months) The selected vendor must also provide writing services for the site and assist in developing a longterm editorial calendar. Familiarity with foreign investing and private equity is required. Leveraging OPIC's completed message platform and through coordination with OPIC's internal experts and resources, content will be developed for the full site (an estimated 35-50 pages). 4) Technology Implementation (4 years) The OPIC website must feature a database driven content management system (CMS) that includes the following capabilities: ˇ User management ˇ Media management ˇ Language management ˇ Banner management ˇ Contact management ˇ Enhanced Search ˇ Web link management ˇ Content management - WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor ˇ Syndication and newsfeed management ˇ Menu management ˇ Template management All materials and deliverables developed under this contract will follow the following policies and procedures: Any electronic and information technology (EIT) procured through this contract must meet the applicable accessibility standards in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The OPIC policy for Section 508 compliance is BIS_08_010_Policy_508_Compliance_v3.doc. OPIC policy prohibits web sites from mentioning or linking to commercial entities in such a way that one could imply that an agency or the Government sanctions or endorses the activities, services or products of the entity. The OPIC policy for utilizing external links is BIS_08_050_Policy_External_Links_v2.doc. Contractors need to follow certain security standards for federal government software application development. This policy is detailed in BIS_08_060_Policy_Security_Standards_for_Software_Development_v2.doc. Contractors need to follow the processes and procedures for versioning of the source code of OPIC enterprise application systems. BIS_08_090_Policy_Versioning_and_filing_of_source_code_v2.doc Contractors will not provide EIT that use of video, streaming or other alternative technologies on OPIC's web sites BIS_08_100_Policy_Use_of_Video_Streaming_or_Alternative_Tech_v2.doc Procedures and guidelines for developing, maintaining the content, design, and quality of OPIC's web sites are found in BIS_08_110_Policy_Web_Content_Maintenance_and_Quality_v2.doc The Contractor must handle the filing , storage, retrieval and protection of original documents and other records received or created by the contractor relating to OPIC's in compliance with OPIC/Federal Records Management regulations. As such, the contractor must deliver on a periodic basis (TBD) to OPIC all such correspondence for insertion into OPIC's official Records Management system. `OPIC ERecords Management Policy 2011.doc'

5) Special Considerations The website must be Section 508 Compliant and be tested using validation tools. Resulting compliance reports must be provided. Also important to note: As part of the executive order to make sites more transparent, many OPIC departments are developing online application forms, or enhancing existing ones. Ease of use, transparency and `user-friendliness' are critical elements and the site must be able to support these new online applications in a manner that complies with OMB requirements. 6) Ongoing maintenance (four years) Upon completion of the site, OPIC will seek ongoing support for any technical issues or necessary site requirements. Response times within 24-hours will be required.

B. SOCIAL MEDIA PROGRAM SUPPORT: (24 months) Research conducted in the OPIC communication audit showed that key audiences, such as members of Congress, their staffers, investors, entrepreneurs, and larger businesses can efficiently be reached through social media channels. Therefore, OPIC views social media channels as an ideal way in which to reach these target audiences. The selected vendor will support the OPIC marketing team by providing the following services: 1) OPIC Blog Support ˇ Blog development ­ Create initial blog and develop editorial calendar to complement planned initiatives and events (existing, approved content such as op-eds, speeches, etc. will be leveraged as much as possible). ˇ Blog content development ­ Support the creation of at least one blog post per week. ˇ Blog seeding and syndication ­ Seed content across other social channels as well as within public communities and blogs of interest in order to increase readership and drive traffic to the OPIC blog. o Profile creation and maintenance ­ Create profiles for seeding ensuring a consistent representation across multiple channels; these will be regularly updated to reflect ongoing initiatives and messaging. o RSS Feed monitoring ­ Develop and manage a list of RSS Feeds from key influencer blogs and public communities, monitoring for opportunities for OPIC to engage in relevant discussions, as well as for conversations and news centering on any topic that OPIC blog content addresses. o Blog directories, networks and RSS syndication ­ Submit the OPIC blog RSS feed, description, and top keywords to blog directories, blog networks, and blogs accepting direct RSS syndication in order to increase visibility and boost SEO. o Direct syndication ­ Reach out to blogs of interest and coordinate with site managers to repurpose existing content for guest post opportunities. o Discussion/activity monitoring ­ Manage activity on all seeding and syndication channels, monitoring any conversation in which OPIC participates and responding to comments and facilitating discussions as necessary. Work will require a fair amount of autonomy together with a an understanding that certain topics are sensitive and must be cleared with OPIC before posting. o Analytics ­ Monitor blog analytics to track unique visitors per month, click through rates (CTR) from seeded links, and top referring sites. Deliverables will be determined at time of contract award. 2) Social Channels Support (24 months) Feeding and nurturing of content across the blogosphere, Twitter, Facebook and other social channels will be an important element of the OPIC communications strategy. Leveraging existing OPIC content (speeches, press releases, case studies, etc.), the chosen vendor will repackage this content and publish as appropriate according to an established content schedule. ˇ Twitter campaigns ­ Support the posting of regular content and recommend creative campaigns for increasing engagement through this channel. ˇ Listening post ­ Work closely with OPIC's External Affairs team to regularly monitor conversations for content relevant to OPIC across the social Web and alert OPIC to opportunities to insert OPIC content into these conversations as appropriate and alert OPIC executives to critical conversations in progress, which may require a response. C. MEDIA RELATIONS: (24 months) OPIC has internal resources to support the majority of the agency's press announcements. However, on occasion, we require outside assistance in external media relations for major initiatives. These include tier-one announcements, regional signing ceremonies, and local events. On average, the chosen vendor will support OPIC on two press events or activities per month. This work is likely to include but not limited to: ˇ Press Target Identification ˇ Media outreach efforts such as: o Reporter Meet & Greets o Op-Ed placement(s) o Blogger Roundtables o Attendance recruitment for OPIC events o Media outreach in support of small business workshops ˇ Media/Messaging Training session(s) o Establish a media training curriculum to enhance adoption of the new message platform recently developed and based on results from the Communications Audit. o Provide training to all VPs and director-level employees that speak publicly (and regularly) on behalf of OPIC. Exact format of training will be determined at time of contract award, but will most likely involve a group overview as well as individual, one-on-one training sessions. o Refresher training as needed in subsequent quarters and/or for specific high-level events.
