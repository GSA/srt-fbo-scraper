   1. Introduction

      1.1   Background
Â 
The Division of Federal-State Relations (DFSR) is one of four work units within the Office of Regional Operations, Office of Regulatory Affairs,
Food and Drug Administration. The Division participates in cooperative and educational efforts designed to inform industry, health
professionals, and the public about FDA's functions and its commitment to safeguard the public health. DFSR interacts with, and serves as the
focal point for cooperating state and local officials, and associations of these state officials, to promote cohesive and uniform policies and
activities in food and drug-related matters.
           Division of Federal-State Relations (DFSR) is responsible for broadcasting both emergency notifications related to protecting the
           public health as well as general messaging to over 2000 identified stakeholders.  Currently, DFSR utilizes a system that has become
           obsolete and no longer performs this function to specifications required by DFSR.


           The current DFSR broadcast system does not provide for the level of service needed to disseminate information through reliable, high-
           volume output means.  A new, state of the art, system is necessary to meet the increasing demands to rapidly and reliably inform
           stakeholders.

The FDA is soliciting for a fully integrated mass notification system that is Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) compliant with a broad spectrum
of integrated solutions. The notification system must be flexible to allow for integration with other public health and public safety mass
notification systems if necessary.  It must also be modular in design to allow for scalability.  FDA also seeks to acquire system maintenance,
monitoring and a means to provide periodic upgrades.  The product/services must meet the specifications in accordance with the Statement of
Work.  The place and period of performance are described in the Statement of Work attached herein.

 Evaluation Factors for Award

The proposals will be evaluated for technical capability, relevant experience, past performance and price. Technical capability, relevant
experience and past performance when combined are significantly more important when compared to price in determining the best value to the
government. The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  

Factor 1 Technical:  The extent to which the Offeror demonstrates that the system functions in accordance with the specifications of the
Statement of Work.
(See attachment 1)

Factor 2. Relevant Experience: The extent to which to Offeror demonstrates that it has

list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information

Factor 4. Price:   Offerors shall be evaluated on price, as shown in the submitted pricing sheet (See attachment 2).  This evaluation shall
include the entire period of performance.  Additionally, offerors shall be evaluated in regards to the realism and reasonableness of the

realistic, and complete in relation to the solicitation and the offeror’s technical proposal.
