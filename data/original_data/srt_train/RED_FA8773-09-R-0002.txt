Key Telephone System .  Includes the common control unit(s) that terminate the central office telephone lines and the customer workstation multi-line telephones.  New installations must be approved by the MAJCOM A6 per AFI 33-111.



Power Over Ethernet (POE).  Technology that allows network devices to receive power over the same copper cable that is used for data.  POE devices and power sources must comply with IEEE 802.3 standards.



Premise Circuit:



Switched Line:  Any 2-wire loop start station connected to a switching system.



Non-switched Line:  Any line not connected to a switching system (e.g., Foreign Exchange line, auto ring-down line, private line, PABX/DCO line, etc).



Two-way:  A full duplex communication path in which a call originates at either end.  Unless specified otherwise, all paths are two-way.



One-way:  A full duplex communication path in which a call originates at only one end.  Unless specified otherwise, equipment shall be designed to allow configuring either end as the originator.



Key System Main Line.  A line terminated on the "trunk" side of the key system usually shared by other key system stations.



Proprietary Telephone.  Telephones designed for use in specific telephone systems.  Normally such telephones are not interoperable with other brands of systems.



Soil/Surface Types.



	Soft soils are those soils native to the area that do not contain rock as part of the natural composition.  Compacted areas with less than six inches of gravel or shell rock over the native soil are considered soft areas.



Hard soils are those soils native to the area that do contain rock as part of the natural composition.  Compacted areas with a hard surface such as asphalt, concrete, or more than six inches of gravel, shell rock, or clay are considered hard areas.



Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).  Also known as Internet Voice, is a technology that allows telephone calls using broadband Internet connection instead of regular (or analog) phone line. Some services using VoIP may only allow calls to other people using the same service, but others may allow anyone having a telephone number - including local, long distance, mobile, and international numbers. Also, while some services only work over a computer or a special VoIP phone, other services allow use of a traditional phone through an adaptor.  (adapted from http://www.fcc.gov/voip/)

(a) Definitions. "Services," as used in this clause, includes services performed, workmanship, and material furnished or utilized in the performance of services. (b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. (c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (d) If the Government performs inspections or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (e) If any of the services do not conform with contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by reperformance, the Government may (1) require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements and (2) reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed. (f) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may (1) by contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service or (2) terminate the contract for default.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 53 of 148 (1) All or substantially all of the Contractor's business; (2) All or substantially all of the Contractor's operation at any one plant or separate location where the contract is being performed; or (3) A separate and complete major industrial operation connected with the performance of this contract. "Materials," includes data when the contract does not include the Warranty of Data clause. (b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the material, fabricating methods, work, and services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. (c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (e) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they shall be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (f) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (h) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under the Payments Under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. (g)(1) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-(i) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (ii) Terminate this contract for default. (2) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute. (h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (f) and (g) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to (1) fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel or (2) the conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (i) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 54 of 148 (j) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (k) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Governmentfurnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION (AUG 1996)

(a) Definition. "Work" includes, but is not limited to, materials, workmanship, and manufacture and fabrication of components. (b) The Contractor shall maintain an adequate inspection system and perform such inspections as will ensure that the work performed under the contract conforms to contract requirements. The Contractor shall maintain complete inspection records and make them available to the Government. All work shall be conducted under the general direction of the Contracting Officer and is subject to Government inspection and test at all places and at all reasonable times before acceptance to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the contract. (c) Government inspections and tests are for the sole benefit of the Government and do not-(1) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for providing adequate quality control measures; (2) Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for damage to or loss of the material before acceptance; (3) Constitute or imply acceptance; or (4) Affect the continuing rights of the Government after acceptance of the completed work under paragraph (i) of this section. (d) The presence or absence of a Government inspector does not relieve the Contractor from any contract requirement, nor is the inspector authorized to change any term or condition of the specification without the Contracting Officer's written authorization. (e) The Contractor shall promptly furnish, at no increase in contract price, all facilities, labor, and material reasonably needed for performing such safe and convenient inspections and tests as may be required by the Contracting Officer. The Government may charge to the Contractor any additional cost of inspection or test when work is not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, or when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary. The Government shall perform all inspections and tests in a manner that will not unnecessarily delay the work. Special, full size, and performance tests shall be performed as described in the contract. (f) The Contractor shall, without charge, replace or correct work found by the Government not to conform to contract requirements, unless in the public interest the Government consents to accept the work with an appropriate adjustment in contract price. The Contractor shall promptly segregate and remove rejected material from the premises. (g) If the Contractor does not promptly replace or correct rejected work, the Government may (1) by contract or otherwise, replace or correct the work and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2) terminate for default the Contractor's right to proceed. (h) If, before acceptance of the entire work, the Government decides to examine already completed work by removing it or tearing it out, the Contractor, on request, shall promptly furnish all necessary facilities, labor, and

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 55 of 148 material. If the work is found to be defective or nonconforming in any material respect due to the fault of the Contractor or its subcontractors, the Contractor shall defray the expenses of the examination and of satisfactory reconstruction. However, if the work is found to meet contract requirements, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment for the additional services involved in the examination and reconstruction, including, if completion of the work was thereby delayed, an extension of time. (i) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall accept, as promptly as practicable after completion and inspection, all work required by the contract or that portion of the work the Contracting Officer determines can be accepted separately. Acceptance shall be final and conclusive except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or the Government's rights under any warranty or guarantee. (End of clause)

In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/. (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number: National Labor Relations Board Division of Information 1099 14th Street, N.W.

(g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, entered into in connection with this contract, unless exempted by the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs on account of special circumstances in the national interest under authority of 29 CFR 470.3(c). For indefinite quantity subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

"Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee," means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this con- tract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent informa-tion to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determina- tions issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 81 of 148 fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of Compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or fur- nished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum Wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor Contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 82 of 148 of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to Employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act-(A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay Periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 83 of 148 withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service Employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority List. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and Interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's Certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions Involving Employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 84 of 148 (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR Parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision-(1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. Disputes Concerning Labor Standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR Parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives.

52.222-43 FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT AND SERVICE CONTRACT ACT--PRICE ADJUSTMENT (MULTIPLE YEAR AND OPTION CONTRACTS) (NOV 2006) (a) This clause applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations and contracts subject to collective bargaining agreements. (b) The Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract do not include any allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for which adjustment is provided under this clause. (c) The wage determination, issued under the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.), by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract. If no such determination has been made applicable to this contract, then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 206) current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract. (d) The contract price or contract unit price labor rates will be adjusted to reflect the Contractor's actual increase or decrease in applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with or the decrease is voluntarily made by the Contractor as a result of: (1) The Department of Labor wage determination applicable on the anniversary date of the multiple year contract, or at the beginning of the renewal option period. For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The Contractor chose to pay $4.10. The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50 per hour. Even if the Contractor voluntarily increases the rate to $4.75 per hour, the allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour; (2) An increased or decreased wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of law; or (3) An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that is enacted after award of this contract, affects the minimum wage, and becomes applicable to this contract under law. (e) Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, and the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit. (f) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new wage determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in the clause shall preclude the Government from asserting a claim within the period permitted by law. The notice shall

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 86 of 148 contain a statement of the amount claimed and any relevant supporting data, including payroll records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require. Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price or contract unit price labor rates shall be modified in writing. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date. (g) The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.

Data shall be submitted in accordance with Federal Standard No. 313, whether or not the apparently successful offeror is the actual manufacturer of these items.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 87 of 148 Failure to submit the Material Safety Data Sheet prior to award may result in the apparently successful offeror being considered nonresponsible and ineligible for award. (e) If, after award, there is a change in the composition of the item(s) or a revision to Federal Standard No. 313, which renders incomplete or inaccurate the data submitted under paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and resubmit the data. (f) Neither the requirements of this clause nor any act or failure to act by the Government shall relieve the Contractor of any responsibility or liability for the safety of Government, Contractor, or subcontractor personnel or property. (g) Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the Contractor from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material. (h) The Government's rights in data furnished under this contract with respect to hazardous material are as follows: (1) To use, duplicate and disclose any data to which this clause is applicable.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative: (a) Hourly rate. (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are-(i) Performed by the Contractor; (ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control. (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor hours performed. (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 89 of 148 (5) Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting Officer or authorized representative. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by-(i) Individual daily job timekeeping records; (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer. (6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative. (7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause. (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (b) Materials. (1) For the purposes of this clause-(i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the ``completion voucher'' and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor.

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and (D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 114 of 148 prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not b e considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 123 of 148 (d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of--or in connection with-- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.

52.215-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION (JAN 2004)--ALTERNATE I (OCT 1997) (a) Definitions. As used in this provision-Discussions are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. In writing, writing, or written means any worded or numbered expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. Proposal modification is a change made to a proposal before t he solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. Proposal revision is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. Time, if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (2) The first page of the proposal must show-(i) The solicitation number; (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 125 of 148 (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal. Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of that agent's authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office. (3) Submission, modification, or revisions of proposals. (i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 126 of 148 (6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award. (7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. (8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of--or in connection with-- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 127 of 148 (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

The proposal shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Equipment and Installation Performance Specification (EIPS), Pricing Table, and the remainder of the RFP. Non-conformance with all of the instructions provided in the RFP may result in an unfavorable proposal evaluation. (b) The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal shall not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements but rather shall provide convincing rationale and details that address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. Offerors shall assume that (1) the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience, and (2) the Government will base the evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal. (c) Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed art work, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. (d) In accordance with FAR Subpart 4.8 (Government Contract Files), the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals (which may be maintained electronically). Unless the Offeror requests otherwise, the Government will destroy extra copies of such unsuccessful proposals. (e) Alternate proposals will not be accepted. The Offeror's proposal and any subsequent negotiated changes thereto shall be binding upon that Offeror. The Government may make a final determination regarding acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal submitted without requesting any further information. However, if deemed necessary, and at its sole discretion, the Government may request additional information from Offerors clarifying or supplementing, but not substantially changing, any proposal as submitted. For that purpose, the Government may clarify or hold discussions regarding any such proposal with the Offeror.

Offerors excluded from the competitive range may request a pre-award debriefing, or they may choose to wait until after the source selection decision to request a post-award debriefing. However, Offerors excluded from the competitive range are entitled to no more than one debriefing for each proposal. The CO will notify unsuccessful Offerors in the competitive range of the source selection decision in accordance with FAR 15.506. Upon such notification, unsuccessful Offerors may request and receive a debriefing. Offerors desiring a debriefing must make their request in accordance with the requirements of FAR 15.505 or 15.506, as applicable. 1.1.3 Discrepancies. If an Offeror believes that the requirements in these instructions contain an error, omission, or are otherwise unsound, the Offeror shall immediately notify the CO in writing with supporting rationale as well as the remedies the Offeror is asking the CO to consider as related to the omission or error. The Offeror is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion. This reservation includes matters of additional or substitute pages of the initial proposal. 1.1.4 Electronic Reference Documents.

Exclude Sections IV and V (no Contracting or Price information shall be included) 1.2.1 Page Limitations. Page limitations shall be treated as maximums. Each page shall be counted except cover pages, table of contents, and resumes. If exceeded, the excess pages will not be read or considered in the evaluation of the proposal. Excess paper copies will be destroyed (except within the original proposal), which may render the Offeror's proposal technically unacceptable. Responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) may be subject to page limitations as specified in the EN cover letters. If an Offeror revises its proposal in response to an EN during discussions, then the original stated page maximum still applies. For example, if the page limitation for the RFP factor is three, then the revised pages must not exceed three pages. 1.2.1.1 Page Size and Format. (a) A page is defined as each face of a sheet of paper containing information. When both sides of a sheet display printed material, it shall be counted as two pages. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches, not including foldouts. Pages may be single-spaced but shall have at least double spacing between paragraphs and factors or sub-factors. Except for the reproduced sections of the solicitation document, Attachment 1 (Pricing Table), and items specified in paragraph (b) below, the text size shall be no less than 12 point, Times New Roman type. Tracking, kerning, and leading values shall not be changed from the default values of the word processing or page layout software. Use at least one-inch margins on all sides.

(b) Legible tables, charts, graphs and figures may be used wherever practical to depict organizations, systems and layout, implementation schedules, plans, etc. These displays shall be uncomplicated, legible, and shall not exceed 11 by 17 inches in size. Foldout pages shall fold entirely within the section, and shall count as two pages. Foldout pages may only be used for large tables, charts, graphs, diagrams and schematics and not for pages of text. For tables, charts, graphs and figures, the text shall be no smaller than eight-point. These limitations shall apply to both electronic and hard copy proposals. 1.2.2 Cross-Referencing. To the greatest extent possible, each section shall be written on a stand-alone basis so that its contents may be evaluated with a minimum of cross referencing to other sections of the proposal. Crossreferencing within a proposal section is permitted where its use would conserve space without impairing clarity. Information required for proposal evaluation which is not found in its designated section will be assumed to have been omitted from the proposal. 1.2.3 Indexing. Tab indexing shall be used to identify sections.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 132 of 148 1.2.4 Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms. Each section shall contain a glossary of all abbreviations and acronyms used, and with an explanation for each. Glossaries do not count against the page limitations for their respective sections. 1.2.5 Binding and Labeling. The proposal shall be bound in two-inch, three-ring, loose leaf binders permitting the binders to lie flat when open. Staples shall not be used. A cover sheet shall be bound in each binder, clearly marked with the title, copy number, solicitation identification, and the Offeror's name. The same identifying data shall be placed on the spine of each binder. All document binders shall have a color other than red (or shades thereof) or other applicable security designation colors. Be sure to apply all appropriate markings including those prescribed in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e), Restriction on Disclosure and Use of Data, and FAR 3.104-4, Disclosure, Protection, and Marking of Contractor Bid or Proposal Information and Source Selection Information. 1.3 Electronic Offers. The Offeror shall include a CD in the Original binder containing all sections. Failure to provide a CD may render the Offeror's proposal non -responsive. The content and page size of electronic copies must be identical to the hard copies. For electronic copies, indicate on each CD the RFP number, title, and Offeror's name. Use separate files to permit rapid location of all sections, exhibits, annexes, and attachments, if any. The Offeror shall submit all required information in electronic format, using recordable, virus-free CDs. Files shall not be compressed. The electronic copies of the proposal shall be submitted in a format readable by Microsoft (MS) Office Word 2007, MS Office Excel 2007, and MS Office Power Point 2007, as applicable. In the event that hard copies and electronic copies of a proposal are submitted and if there are any discrepancies between the hard copies and the electronic copies of the proposal, the hard copies will be used for evaluation. 1.4 Distribution. The "Original" proposal and CD shall be identified. Proposals shall be addressed to the CO and delivered to the CO's attention at the address specified in Section A of the RFP. 2.0 Proposal Content/Binder Sections. 2.1 Executive Summary (Section I ­ consists of maximum of 2 pages). 2.1.1 Narrative Summary. The Offeror shall provide a narrative summary of the entire proposal. The narrative summary shall be concise and address the significant risks and highlights any key or unique features, excluding price. The salient features should tie in with Section M evaluation factors/subfactors. Any summary material presented here shall not be considered as meeting the requirements for any portions of other sections of the proposal. 2.1.2 Table of Contents. Include a master table of contents of the entire proposal. 2.2 Factor 1 -- Mission Capability (Section II ­ consists of maximum of 50 pages). 2.2.1 General. The Mission Capability submittal should be specific and complete. Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important. Offeror's response will be evaluated against the Mission Capability subfactors defined in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award. Using the instructions below, provide the specific and actual methodology you will use to accomplish/satisfy these sub-factors. All the requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory. By your proposal submission, you are representing that your firm will perform all the requirements specified in the solicitation. It is not necessary or desirable for you to tell us so in your proposal. Do not merely reiterate the objectives or reformulate the requirements specified in the solicitation. Identify submitted material by corresponding factor, subfactor, and paragraph herein. If an Offeror is subcontracting/teaming with another vendor who will perform more than ten percent of the work, or if other than the prime contractor will be performing switch maintenance, the prime shall clearly identify work to be performed by each specific sub-contractor within the appropriate factors/sub-factors in the prime's proposal. The proposals shall provide a clear distinction of functions to be performed by the prime and subcontractor to include: the nature of work, criticality of the work, and the percentage of overall effort performed by each subcontractor in each area of service provided. Failure to provide the information on each vendor in a subcontracting/teaming arrangement shall render submitted proposal nonresponsive and unacceptable.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 133 of 148 2.2.2 Format and Specific Content.

Provide a discussion of the Offeror's security and safety practices that will be employed on this contract. 2.3 Factor 2 -- Past Performance (Section III ­ consists of maximum of 30 pages). 2.3.1 General. Each Offeror shall submit a past performance section with its proposal, containing past performance information (PPI) in accordance with the format contained in paragraph 2.3.6. This information is required on the Offeror and all subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners who are proposed to perform ten percent or more of the proposed effort based on the total proposed price or perform aspects of the effort the Offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each Offeror in this section and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past performance. Sales puffery is not necessary or desired. Offerors should focus on the facts of their performance that include the types of equipment that reflect relevancy to the equipment operated, maintained, and otherwise supported by this acquisition. 2.3.2 New Corporate Entities. New corporate entities may submit data on prior contracts involving its officers, employees, and key personnel who have relevant experience, and/or data of efforts that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. Discuss the roles and responsibilities of personnel involved in the prior contracts cited. 2.3.3 Reference Data. The Government reserves the right to contact and use information provided by the references and any other sources. The Government will also obtain and consider information about other contracts not mentioned in the Offeror's proposal, but which the Government believes to be similar to the proposed effort. It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure all reference data is current and correct so that the team can properly evaluate PPI. 2.3.4 Relevant Contracts. Submit information in accordance with the format shown in paragraph 2.3.6 below. Offeror shall submit PPI on no more than seven recent contracts; the total includes any subcontractors. (For example, if the Prime submits five contracts, the two remaining can be used for subcontractor(s).) Recent is defined as the period of performance within five years preceding the RFP closing date. Submit PPI considered most relevant in demonstrating Offeror's (and/or sub-contractor's) ability to perform the proposed effort. Reference each contract only once. Do not duplicate a contract reference for prime and subcontractor but rather explain the role each played within the contract reference itself. Also, include information on up to three recent contracts performed by each of your teaming partners and significant subcontractors that you consider most relevant in demonstrating their ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Leave at least three blank lines between contract references. For a description of the characteristics or aspects the Government will consider in determining how contracts are considered recent and relevant, see Section M, paragraph 2.1.3. 2.3.5 Specific Content. Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts they deem relevant to the proposed effort. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the Offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage risk. Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 134 of 148 limited or no confidence rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex acquisition, or an Offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered. The Offeror shall clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. This may allow the Offeror to be considered a higher confidence candidate. Submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an Offeror has overcome past problems is required. 2.3.6 Format for Contract Information. The Offeror shall provide the following information requested in this format for each contract submitted for past performance evaluation. Provide concise comments regarding your performance on the contracts you identify. Provide a separate completed form for each contract/program submitted. A. Offeror/Subcontractor Name (Company/Division): CAGE Code: DUNS Number: (NOTE: If the company or division performing this effort is other than the Offeror, or the relevance of this effort to the instant acquisition is impacted by any company/corporate organizational change, note those changes. Refer to paragraph 2.3.7, "Organizational Structure Change History," provided as part of the Past Performance Section.) B. Acquisition Title: C. Contract Specifics: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Contracting Agency or Customer: Contract Number Contract Type (e.g. firm-fixed-price, T&M, etc): Period of Performance (within the last five years): Initial Contract Cost/Price (Rounded to nearest thousand): $ Current/final Contract Cost/Price(Rounded to nearest thousand): $ Annual Contract Value(Rounded to nearest thousand): $ If Amounts for 5 and 6 above are different, provide a brief description of the reason: ____

D. Brief Description of Effort as __Prime or __Subcontractor (Indicate whether it was O&M, installation/implementation, or other and highlight portions considered most relevant to current acquisition) E. Completion Date: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Original date: Current Schedule: Estimate at Completion: How Many Times Changed: Primary Causes of Change:

F. Primary Customer Points of Contact: Provide current information on all three individuals for Government contracts. Provide points of contact fulfilling these same roles for commercial contracts. (1) Program Manager: Name Office Address Telephone Name Office Address Telephone Name

(2) Contracting Officer:

(3) Administrative

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 135 of 148 Office Address Telephone G. Relevancy: (1) Relevant to the following PWS Appendix 5.2 equipment: __________________________ (2) Specify how the Offeror believes this contract is relevant to contractual requirements, specifically the operation and maintenance of the equipment listed in PWS Appendix 5.2. (3) For each of the applicable subfactors under the Mission Capability factor in Section M, illustrate how your experience on this program applies to that subfactor. H. Address any technical (or other) area about this contract/program considered unique. I. Specify, by name, any key individual(s) who participated in this program and are proposed to support the instant acquisition. Also, indicate their contractual roles for both acquisitions. J. Describe the nature or portion of the work on the proposed effort to be performed by the business entity being reported here. Also, estimate the percentage of the total proposed effort that will be performed by this entity and whether it will be performing as the prime, subcontractor, or a corporate division related to the prime (define relationship). K. Describe any past or present litigation or administrative proceeding pertaining to the reference contract, including the results if the proceedings are complete or the status if the proceedings are ongoing. Provide a copy of any cure notices or show cause notices received on each contract listed and a description of any corrective action taken. Indicate if any of the contracts listed were terminated and the type and reasons for termination. L. Discuss the number and severity of any problems in the referenced contract considered relevant to the proposed efforts and identify the effectiveness of corrective actions to resolve the problems. Provide any contract discrepancy reports, corrective action reports or other non-compliance correspondence. M. Include any information not previously covered, which will enhance the evaluators' understanding of the Offeror or any sub-contractor's proposed qualifications. 2.3.7 Organizational Structure Change History. Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal section a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/ performance confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider PPI provided by other sources as well as that provided by the Offeror(s), your "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources. If no changes have occurred within the organizational structure, the Offeror may refer to the information provided in accordance with 2.3.6 above. 2.3.8 Consent Letters. The Offeror shall submit a consent letter, executed by any potential subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners. The consent letter authorizes release of adverse PPI to the Offeror so the Offeror can, in turn, respond to such information. A sample letter follows: SAMPLE Contracting Officer:

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 136 of 148 We are participating as a (subcontractor/teaming partner) with (prime contractor or name of entity providing proposal) in responding to the 38 EIG/PKL, Tinker Air Force Base Request for Proposal FA8773-09-R-0002 for the O&M of the BTS contract at Altus AFB OK. We understand that the Government is placing increased emphasis on past performance in order to obtain best value in source selections. In order to facilitate the performance confidence assessment process we are signing this consent letter to allow you to discuss our past and present performance information with the prime contractor during the source selection process. (Signature, printed name, and title of individual who has the authority to sign for and legally bind the company) Company Name: Address: 2.3.9 Client Authorization Letters. PPI concerning private sector contractors, subcontractors and joint venture partners cannot be disclosed to the Government without their consent. Client authorization letters are required for each identified effort for a commercial customer. This letter will authorize release to the Government of requested information on the Offeror's performance. The Government will need the consent before contacting commercial customers to assess the Offeror's past performance. In an effort to assist the Source Selection Evaluation Team (SSET) in assessing Offeror's past performance relevancy and confidence, the Government requests the following client authorization letter be completed by any commercial customers identified in Offeror's proposal. The completed client authorization letters shall be submitted as part of Offeror's Present/Past Performance Section. SAMPLE Client: We are responding to the 38 EIG/PKL, Tinker Air Force Base Request for Proposal FA8773-09-R-0002 for the O&M of the BTS contract at Altus AFB OK. In their acquisitions, the Government is placing increased emphasis on past performance as a source selection factor. The Government requires entities responding to their solicitation to identify clients and requests client participation in the evaluation process. You are hereby authorized to respond to those inquiries if the contracting office contacts you for information on work performed by our firm. We have identified ______ of your organization as the point of contact based on his/her knowledge of our work. We appreciate your cooperation. You may direct any questions to 2.4 Factor 3 ­ Price (Section IV). 2.4.1 General Instructions. 2.4.1.1 Price Reasonableness, Realism, Balance, and Affordability. This section is to assist the Offeror in submitting pricing information that is required to evaluate the reasonableness, realism, balance, and/or affordability of the proposed price. Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of Offeror's proposal. Unrealistically low or high proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal. Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Offers must provide sufficient detail that demonstrates reasonableness, realism, balance, and/or affordability. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed prices rests with the Offeror at the time of proposal or during subsequent discussions (if any are held). 2.4.1.2 Price Information. The price proposal shall not include information beyond that required by this instruction unless the Offeror considers it essential to document or support Offeror's price position. All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in this section or assumptions

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 137 of 148 of the proposal. Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included Mission Capabilities or Past Performance Sections. 2.4.1.3 Pricing Information Requirements. Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.4. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.4 apply, the Offeror may be required to submit cost or pricing data. 2.4.1.4 Rounding. All dollar amounts (unit and extended prices and other price factors) provided shall be rounded to the nearest penny (two decimal places only). This includes base period and out-year (option) prices. Failure to round unit prices to no more than two decimals may result in rejection of proposal. 2.4.2 Section Organization. The Price Section shall consist of the following: (i) Table of Contents: includes Table of Contents and summary descriptions of estimating, purchasing, and accounting systems; estimating, accounting, and invoicing practices. (ii) Pricing Notes/Methodology: pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology. (1) Purchasing System. Provide a summary description of Offeror's purchasing system or methods (e.g., how material requirements are determined). For Time and Material (T&M) CLINs: explain how the Offeror provides for competition and selects sources; when firm quotes are obtained; what provision is made to ensure quantity and other discounts are received and passed along to the Government; and otherwise ensuring prices are fair and reasonable IAW FAR 15.4. Also, identify any deviations from Offeror's standard procedures in this proposal. (2) Accounting System. Indicate how Offeror's accounting system will be adequate for segregation of T&M elements and track estimates and actual use. The discussion shall also include how the system provides for potential cost/price over-run notification. Include how and at what point the Offeror intends to notify the Government of an approaching or possible over-run situation on a project or work order. Further, explain how the accounting system accounts for multiple labor/payroll situations, such as weekly payroll payments to employees and DOL-approved certified payroll for DBA work. Also explain the availability of payroll reports/data to support SCA requirements, including but not limited to yearly price adjustments. Also, identify any deviations from Offeror's standard procedures in preparing this proposal. (3) Pricing Assumptions/Exceptions. Repeat any assumptions/exceptions affecting pricing only in this area. Do not cross reference to/from Section V, Contracting Documentation. Annotate none, if no assumptions/exceptions apply. (iii) Pricing Table (included as Attachment 1 to the solicitation). Offeror shall include a printed copy in this section of the Pricing Section. The Offeror shall also comply with the following additional requirements and instructions: (1) Reference Pricing Table. Price all Contract Line Item Numbers/Subcontract Line Item Numbers (CLINs/SLINs)/Product Identifications (PIDS) with the exception of the Reimbursable Material CLIN prices (rates must be populated). Offeror shall also enter a material factor that represents a loaded rate the Government will be charged to procure cost reimbursable materials. Limit unit prices and rates to two decimal places. The abbreviations Not Separately Priced (NSP) and No Charge (N/C) are not acceptable entries. If the Offeror is providing a CLIN/SLIN to the Government at no additional charge, $0.00 must be entered for that item . See clause 52.232-36; GPC is an authorized method of payment under this contract. GPC cardholders shall not be charged additional fees on top of those specified within the pricing table at the time of billing. (2) Price Proposal ­ Electronic Media Submission of Pricing Table. The PIDs and/or SLINs in the Pricing Table of this solicitation are an electronic file, presented as Excel for Microsoft Office 2007 spreadsheets/workbook format. Submit an electronic copy using the exact file provided by the Government without changing the format of the files.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 138 of 148 (a) Description of Files. EXCEL WORKSHEET CONTENTS Summary Sheet...............................................Contains cells for the entry of unit prices and calculates extended prices for O&M CLIN/SLINs for the Base Period through Option Period 4. Provides a place to enter an indirect material factor that will be used when purchasing material at cost or for subcontracted efforts for items that are not included in the pre-priced PIDs (e.g. the M in the T&M CLINs) Summary prices for all other CLINs/SLINs (except Reimbursable Materials) are linked to the Grand Total Amount on other worksheets. Worksheets containing Product Identification (PID) and/or Subcontract Line Item Numbers (SLINs)................................Entry of PID/SLIN Unit Prices is required for the Base Period and all Option Years. (b) Operation & Maintenance (O&M) pricing. O&M pricing does not include workorder services price allocations, other than typical management functions such as but not limited to: oversight/program management and quality control of staff and subcontractors performing work orders. Inclusion of such price allocations within the O&M price may result in the offer becoming unbalanced. (c) The EIPS provides detailed descriptions of the material and labor effort (those items that are pre-priced for material and labor for installation, removal, and/or relocation) required by the attached Pricing Table and identified by PIDs. This solicitation/contract is principally for services for O&M and work-order services under the Service Contract Act (SCA). Also required in this solicitation/contract is a substantial and segregable amount of construction, alteration, renovation, or repair work. The Davis Bacon Act (DBA) is applicable to work orders with an aggregate dollar value exceeding or expected to exceed (estimated above) $2,000 for construction, alteration, and/or repair. Some of the SLINs/PIDs for installation could be both SCA and DBA applicable, dependent upon individual work order requirements. By referencing the DBA wage determination, inserting the appropriate DBA clauses into the solicitation, and identifying the types of effort that may occur, offerors are able to identify the appropriate SCA/DBA labor mix based upon their technical approach. It is each Offeror's responsibility to evaluate work effort and pro pose the appropriate labor mix for the level of effort required to perform the services described in the PWS and associated appendixes for the work-order services (CLINs X003 ­ X010) and price allocations for installation of SLINs/PIDs in the Pricing Table based upon their knowledge and experiences. When in doubt, an Offeror may assume that the higher prevailing wage between the SCA or DBA will prevail on an individual work order when it is possible that a PID could be used in either situation and its price could represent either. The Government will not assume responsibility for any omission but rather rely on the Offeror's knowledge of the requirement and industry to price appropriately for either situation. (d) Time & Material (T&M) CLINs. These CLINs are for work over and above that already pre-priced or firm-fixed priced. T&M rates will include all indirect expenses, overhead, and profit including any proposal/processing expenses. Labor rates will be loaded into the Labor PIDs to reflect any labor costs directly associated with this type of work. Rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general administrative expense(s), and profit (fully burdened to cover all expenses). Reimbursable material CLIN items shall be provided at cost. Material-handling expenses shall include only those costs clearly excluded from the labor-hour rate and shall be included in the material factor. The material factor represents a loaded rate the Government will be charged to purchase these direct materials in accordance with the Contractor's usual accounting procedure and consistent with FAR Part 31. 2.5 Contract Documentation (Section V). Submit two printed copies of the contracting information as part of Section V. Include original, signed documents in the Original Proposal" binder, and one copy in the Copy 1

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 139 of 148 binder. The purpose of this section is to provide information to the Government for preparing the contract document and supporting file. Section V shall be submitted as follows: Section A - Solicitation/Contract Form. Complete Blocks 12 through 18 (including original signature and date) of the SF 33. Signature by the Offeror on the SF 33 constitutes an offer, which the Government may accept. The "original" copy should be clearly marked under separate cover and should be provided without any punched holes. Instead, secure the original signed SF33 in a document protector bound in the original proposal binder. Offeror shall include a statement within Section V that the proposal is valid through the proposal acceptance period specified in Section A. Section B - Supplies or Services and Costs/Prices. Do not include. This section will be populated at contract award from data provided on Attachment 1, Pricing Table. Sections C through F. Do not include. These sections are not modifiable by the Offeror and are redundant to include with the proposal submission. Section G - Contract Administrative Data. Offeror shall provide a remit-to address if different from the mailing address in Block 7 on the SF33. The Remit-to address will be included in Section G of any resultant contract at the time of award. Offeror may omit Section G if remit-to address does not apply. Section H - Special Contract Requirements. Do not include. This section is not modifiable by the Offeror and is redundant to include with the proposal submission. Section I - Contract Clauses. Submit pages for only the clauses that require fill-ins. Ensure they are from the RFP itself, which includes the RFP and page numbers. Other pages in this section need not be included with the submission. Section K ­ (a) ORCA (Representations, Certifications, and other Statements of Offerors). Completed ORCA representations, certifications, acknowledgments and statements shall be included with submission. Ensure all ORCA are complete and accurate at the time of proposal. ORCA representations and certifications must include those specified within Section K of this RFP. ORCA can be accessed at http://orca.bpn.gov. Offeror shall be eligible for award under the specified NAICS code, 517110, and the specified set-aside at the time of submittal of their proposal and remain eligible when verified again prior to award of the contract. (b) Joint Venture Agreements. Per the Small Business Administration (SBA), Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides; however the joint venture agreement must be received by SBA PRIOR to proposal due date and approved before award of any resulting contract. If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise your assigned SBA Business Specialist (BDS) as soon as possible. It is also recommended that the agreement be submitted as soon as practicable to ensure compliance with established regulations. Any corrections and/or changes needed can be made only when the BDS has adequate time for a thorough review before the proposal due date. No corrections and/or changes are allowed after time of submissions of proposal or bids. Sections L and M. Do not include. These sections are not modifiable by the Offeror. 3.0 Exceptions and/or Assumptions. 3.1 Offerors shall specify any exceptions taken to the RFP and/or assumptions made for proposal preparation. Exceptions and/or assumptions shall be addressed by section, factor, and sub-factor (where applicable). 3.2 Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. Each exception shall be specifically related to each paragraph and/or

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 140 of 148 specific part of the solicitation to which the exception is taken. Provide rationale in support of the exception and fully explain its impact, if any, on the performance, schedule, price, and specific requirements of the solicitation. 3.3 Ensure Offerors list any assumptions that affect the offered price, such as Government Furnished Property/ Government Furnished Equipment (GFP/GFE), base support, long lead costs, termination costs, inflation rate summary and explanation, and special tooling/test equipment, etc. Also, state clearly any exception to the ground rules and assumptions provided in the solicitation and each qualification of the Price section, if any. Provide complete rationale for any exceptions. Should the Offeror have no exceptions or assumptions, then the proposal shall so state no exceptions taken to the RFP and/or no assumptions made for the RFP proposal submission. Moreover, failure to include assumptions and/or exceptions in this area will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation (as amended) and resulting award document. 4.0 Other Information Required. 4.1 Authorized Offeror Personnel. Provide the name, title, e-mail address, voice and fax telephone numbers, street and mailing address (if a PO Box is used) of the primary and alternate company/division point of contact regarding decisions made with respect to your proposal and who can obligate your company contractually.

Provide company/division's street address, county and facility code; CAGE code; DUNS code; TIN; size of business (large or small); and labor surplus area designation.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 141 of 148 Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE 52.217-5 Evaluation Of Options JUL 1990

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT M-1 EVALUATION OF OFFERS 1.0 Source Selection. 1.1 Basis for Contract Award. This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), when appropriate, and the Air Force Source Selection Mandatory Procedures (MP5315.3), dated January 2008. These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil. The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Mission Capability, Past Performance, and Price. A contract may be awarded to the Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the Offeror who gives the Air Force the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced Offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors, and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical superiority, overall business approach, and/or superior past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the price difference. The SSA will base the decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all the criteria in the solicitation. While the Government Source Selection Evaluation Team (SSET) and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. 1.2 Number of Contract to Be Awarded. The Government intends to award one contract, on an all or none basis, for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the specified Base Telecommunications System (BTS). 1.3 Rejection of Unrealistic Offers. The SSET may reject any proposal that it considers is unrealistic in terms of contract terms and conditions, or is unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates and/or competitive pricing. The SSET may reject a proposal that reflects an inherent lack of competence or fails to comprehend the complexity and risks of the requirement for the aforementioned reasons. 1.4 Correction Potential of Proposals. The SSET will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency or uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. The Government may eliminate an Offeror from the competitive range if an aspect of the proposal does not meet the solicitation requirements and is not considered correctable. 2.0 Evaluation Factors and Subfactors. (a) The SSET will use Mission Capability, Past Performance, and Price evaluation factors and subfactors to evaluate each proposal. The responsive and responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described herein will be considered the best value for award. (b) Relative Importance of Factors and Subfactors. The relative importance of each factor is as follows in descending order: Factor 1 (Mission Capability), Factor 2 (Past Performance), and Factor 3 (Price). Within the Mission Capability Factor, the subfactors are also in descending order of importance. In accordance with FAR

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 142 of 148 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are more important than price; however, price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. 2.1 Mission Capability Evaluation. The Mission Capability evaluation provides for two distinct but related assessments: the Mission Capability Technical Rating and the Mission Capability Risk Rating. These two ratings have equal impact for the rating of each Mission Capability subfactor. 2.1.1 Mission Capability Technical Rating. The mission capability technical rating provides an assessment of the Offeror's capability to satisfy the Government's requirements. Each Mission Capability subfactor will re ceive one of the color ratings described in AFFARS MP5315.3, Mission Capability Ratings (excerpted below). They focus on the strengths, deficiencies, and uncertainties of the Offeror's proposal. The color rating depicts how well the Offeror's proposal meets the Mission Capability subfactor requirements. Subfactor ratings will not be combined into an overall color rating for the Mission Capability factor. TABLE 1- MISSION CAPABILITY TECHNICAL RATINGS COLOR Blue RATING Exceptional DESCRIPTION Exceeds the specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Government. A proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies to receive a blue. Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements. A proposal must have no deficiencies to receive a green but may have one or more strengths. There is doubt regarding whether an aspect of the Proposal meets a specified minimum performance or capability requirement, but any such uncertainty is correctable. Fails to meet specified minimum performance or Capability requirements. The proposal has one or more deficiencies and is not awardable.

This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a detailed plan for ensuring adequate and timely completion of various types of work orders that meets all of the following criteria:

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 143 of 148 (i) Sound procedure for completing work orders within time limitations listed in PWS section 1.4 (ii) A well-developed process that allows for planning and implementing tasks in such a manner that workload conflicts will be minimized, and if they do occur, specific guidelines on how these conflicts will be resolved to include coordination with base personnel (iii) Demonstrates ability to manage large projects not generally considered routine installation requirements (e.g., large outside plant installation, manhole/handhole system installation, building re-wire of premise or ISP cable systems, etc); addresses how delays will be avoided when completing O&M requirements or work orders during performance of these larger projects (iv) Provides an effective and detailed plan for demonstrating its ability to concurrently support O&M requirements (PWS Section 1.3) and simultaneous work order requirements (PWS Section 1.4) without compromising the quality or timeliness of either SUBFACTOR 1.3 ­ COMPANY RESOURCES. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a detailed discussion that assures the Government that it will meet or exceed all contractual requirements by addressing all of the following criteria: (i) A table of labor categories, number of on-site personnel in each category, and short position title(s) indicating a sufficient number of on-site personnel in each category required to meet all contractual requirements (ii) An in-depth discussion and evidence of necessary training, experience, qualifications and certifications of the proposed on-site personnel (iii) Discussion of how on-site employees will remain proficient on site-specific systems listed in Appendix 5.2 of the PWS (include the major system nomenclature, not just the manufacturer) (iv) A detailed discussion of how on-site personnel (by labor category) are recruited if a position is vacated (v) A detailed discussion on how the Offeror will replace on-site personnel on short notice; how positions will be covered for absences of varied duration (such as leave or vacations); how Offeror will be adding employees (including the use of permanent, temporary, term employees, prime or sub-contractor use), and how coverage for workload surges or base mission changes will be accomplished (vi) provide procedures for ensuring sufficient quantities of parts, materials, tools, equipment, etc are maintained on site; a complete list of equipment that will be available on site to effect repairs or handle O&M trouble tickets, PMIs, work orders, testing, and other contractual requirements SUBFACTOR 1.4 ­ QUALITY CONTROL. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides an adequate overview of how quality control will be implemented on this requirement and how quality principles will be applied to specific actions required by the PWS. SUBFACTOR 1.5 ­ SAFETY AND SECURITY. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides the following: (i) Discussion of company's safety and environmental practices to include evidence of compliance with federal and OSHA citation(s) and resolution of disciplinary action(s) for the current and past two years (ii) Discussion of the company's accident prevention that includes applicable resolution of any investigative findings; determination of cause; and preventive measures for similar incidents/accidents (iii) Discussion of specific procedures for ensuring the security of Government property and/or facilities to include adequate procedures for key control/lock combination measures and end-of-day security checks

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 144 of 148 (iv) Discussion of process for ensuring password protection and security measures to ensure access to the switching system is restricted to authorized personnel. 2.1.2 Mission Capability Risk Rating. The Mission Capability Risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with the Offeror's proposed approach and includes an assessment of the potential for disruption of schedule, increased price, or degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. The Mission Capability subfactors will receive one of the Risk ratings described in AFFARS MP5315.3, excerpted below. The ratings focus on the risks, i.e., weaknesses and significant weaknesses, of the Offeror's proposed approach to each of the Mission Capability subfactors. For any weakness identified, the evaluation shall address the Offeror's proposed mitigation and why that mitigation approach is or is not manageable. TABLE 2 ­ MISSION CAPABILITY RISK RATINGS RATING Low* DESCRIPTION Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased price or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties. Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased price or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties. Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased price or degradation of performance. Extraordinary contractor emphasis and rigorous Government monitoring may be able to overcome difficulties. The existence of a significant weakness or combination of Weaknesses that is very likely to cause unmitigated disruption of schedule, drastically increased price or severely degraded performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.

Moderate*

High*

Unacceptable

* A plus + rating may be used as an option when risk is evaluated to be in the upper boundaries of a Mission Capability Risk Rating, but is not high enough to merit the next inferior rating. For example, where in the judgment of the evaluator, an offeror has risk that approaches or is nearly rated as a Moderate risk, a Mission Capability Risk Rating of Low+ may be assigned. 2.2 Past Performance Evaluation. The Past Performance evaluation assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an Offeror's ability to supply products and services that meet users' needs based on a demonstrated record of performance, including price and schedule. FACTOR 2 ­ PAST PERFORMANCE. (1) Ratings. The Past Performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in AFFARS MP5315.3, excerpted below.

(2) Evaluation Process. The Past Performance evaluation considers the Offeror's demonstrated record of performance in providing products and services that meet users' needs. Performance confidence is assessed at the overall Past Performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the Offeror's recent past performance. The assessment will focus on performance that is relevant to the Mission Capability subfactors and Price factor taking into consideration their relative order of importance stated herein. The Government may consider past performance in the aggregate in addition to on an individual contract basis. In conducting the Past Performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the Offeror's Past Performance proposal and information obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), or similar systems, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and commercial sources. (i) Recency Assessment. Only recent past performance information (PPI) will be evaluated. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past five years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. (ii) Relevancy Assessment. The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of recent PPI obtained to determine how closely it relates to the Mission Capability subfactors and Price factor, including the relative order of importance specified herein. For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the relevance of the work performed will generally be assessed for the Mission Capability subfactors and Price Factor (however, all aspects of performance (for example the PWS) that relate to this acquisition may be considered). Consideration will be given to product/service similarity, complexity, similar technology, type of effort [O&M, repair, installation, etc.], contract scope and type, and performance period. A relevancy determination of the offeror's past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s). In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the Offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts: DEGREE HIGHLY RELEVANT (HR) RELEVANT (R) SOMEWHAT RELEVANT (SR) DESCRIPTION Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Past/present performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 146 of 148

NOT RELEVANT (NR)

Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

(iii) Performance Quality Assessment. The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts. For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the Mission Capability subfactors and Price Factor; however, all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered. The quality assessment consists of an in-depth evaluation of the PPIRS information, CPARS, interviews with Government customers, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with DCMA officials or other sources known to the Government. The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings. Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from various sources. For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained improvements. Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated. The Government will use the following quality levels when assessing recent, relevant efforts: COLOR BLUE RATING EXCEPTIONAL DESCRIPTION During the contract period, contractor performance is meeting (or met) all contract requirements and consistently exceeding (or exceeded) many. Very few, if any, minor problems encountered. Contractor took immediate and effective corrective action. During the contract period, contractor is meeting (or met) all contract requirements and consistently exceeding (or exceeded) some. Some minor problems encountered. Contractor took timely corrective action. During the contract period, contractor performance is meeting (or met) all contract requirements. For any problems encountered, contractor took effective corrective action. During the contract period, contractor performance is not meeting (or did not meet) some contract requirements. For problems encountered, corrective action appeared only marginally effective, not effective, or not fully implemented. Customer involvement was required. During the contract period, contractor performance is failing (or fail) to meet most contract requirements. Serious problems encountered. Corrective actions were either ineffective or non-existent. Extensive Customer oversight and involvement was required. Unable to provide a rating. Contract did not include performance for this aspect. Do not know.

(3) Assigning Color/Ratings. As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, Offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the mission capability subfactors and price factor,

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 147 of 148 the resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom PPI is not available or so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor. More recent and relevant PPI will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort. A strong record of relevant PPI may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating. Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance. 2.3 Price Evaluation. If a discrepancy exits between the information contained on the disk and the printed copy, the printed copy will prevail. Entering text in cells set up for numerical format will result in calculation errors within the spreadsheets and may render the proposal non-responsive. The Offeror's Price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is fair and reasonable. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business. Normally, price reasonableness is established through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. For additional information, see FAR 31.201-3. FACTOR 3 ­ PRICE FACTOR. (1) The SSET will evaluate the realism of each Offerors' proposed prices. This will include an evaluation of the extent to which proposed prices are sufficient for the work to be performed, reflective of a clear understanding of the requirements, and consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the Offeror's proposal (FAR 15.404 -1(d)(1) and 2.101). The Price Realism Assessment (PRA) will consider mission capability risks (weaknesses) identified during the evaluation of the proposal. (2) The SSET will evaluate the affordability of each Offeror's price proposal by comparing the total proposed price as well as the price for O&M and other significant cost drivers to the independent Government estimate (IGE), and budgetary information. The evaluation shall be made on the basis of a separate comparison for each fiscal year of the contract as well as a comparison between the total proposed prices and the total for budgetary information. (3) The total evaluated price will be derived by multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price for the CLINs/SLINs. O&M and Labor Hour CLINs have been determined to represent a greater value and concern to the Government than pre-priced CLINs (Purchase, Installation, Relocate, and Removal). O&M and Labor Hour CLINs/SLINs shall be evaluated at 100% of the proposed price. Pre-priced work order support CLINs/SLINs/PIDs will be evaluated at 35% of their total price. The proposed price will be evaluated as follows: CLIN X001 (O&M) X002 (Switchboard Ops X003-X008 (pre-priced CLINs/ X009 (Labor Hours) X010 (Material-Cost WEIGHT 100% 100% 35% 100% 100% EVALUATED PRICE Total Price Total Price (if Applicable) Total of applicable CLINs/ SLINs/PIDs) times 35% Total Price (Sum of SLINs) times 100% Total Price (GovernmentReimbursable + Factor) Gov't-provided amount times proposed material factor)

(i) The product of these calculations will be added for the base period and all option periods. The amount on the Cost-reimbursable Materials CLIN will then be added to arrive at a total contract value.

FA8773-09-R-0002 Page 148 of 148 The Government reserves the right to adjust the Offeror's extended prices for the correction of mathematical errors that are determined to be caused by apparent clerical errors. (ii) Evaluation of proposed prices will include a review for : (A) Reasonableness -- Each proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed prices are reasonable. The evaluation will assess whether the proposed prices have been developed by using appropriate and acceptable methodologies, whether proposed prices are supported by factual and verifiable data, and whether estimates are supported by valid and suitable assumption and estimating techniques. (B) Completeness -- Each proposal will be evaluated to determine whether all pricing information required by the solicitation has been submitted and correlates to the operations, maintenance, management, and logistics efforts described in the corresponding sections of the technical proposal. Blank cells will be evaluated as no-bid/no proposal and may result in elimination of your propo sal from competition. (C) Balance -- In addition, prices will be reviewed for unbalanced offers in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g). Offers that do not meet these criteria may be rejected. (D) Apparent Mathematical Errors -- Overriding formulas within the Government-provided workbook may result in calculation errors and cause the proposal to be considered nonresponsive. 3.0 Discussions. If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision. The Contracting Officer may elect to hold limited exchanges with offerors in order to clarify past performance issues, or to resolve minor errors. These exchanges shall not be construed as discussions. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. 4.0 Pre-award Survey. The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each Offeror's capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation. 5.0 Other Solicitation Requirements, Terms and Conditions. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the Offeror being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale. Failure to include assumptions and/or exceptions within the proposal will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation (as amended) and resulting contract.

1.0 Purpose.

The Government developed this performance plan to provide an effective and systematic method to evaluate Contractor provided services as required by the terms and conditions of the contract.  This performance plan implements the requirements of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-124 (Performance Based Service Acquisitions (PBSA)) and AFI 63-101 (Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management), with respect to the Government’s quality assurance requirements.  This performance plan is a living document and the Multi-Functional Team (MFT) will revise or modify the plan as circumstances warrant, throughout the life of the contract, to ensure adequate oversight of Contractor performance is maintained.



2.0 Management.



2.1 Objective.

The Air Force’s objective is to manage the acquisition by ensuring that the Contractor provides highly reliable telecommunications and networked voice, video and data services; that these services meet the stated qualifications; and that the Contractor provides the O&M services according to the contract.  The O&M contract’s objective is for the Contractor to be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and properly perform O&M services of the BTS at Altus AFB OK.  The Contractor shall perform the required O&M services in accordance with (IAW) the original equipment manufacturer’s recommended schedule and established commercial grade specifications, standards, and best practices as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).



2.2 Results (Goals) the MFT Is Trying to Achieve.

The goal of our assessment approach is to gain confidence in the Contractor’s way of doing business and rely on the Contractor’s internal quality control processes.  Then, we adjust the level of oversight to a point that maintains that confidence.  The MFT’s original assessment approach may not stay the same throughout the duration of the contract; therefore, all government evaluators should periodically update the assessment approach when necessary.  By virtue of this performance plan, the MFT will manage the O&M contract and strive to achieve efficiencies, improved customer service and Contractor performance, and cost savings.  Additional goals include maximizing performance; encouraging innovation; promoting performance-based services; and increasing awareness that performance-based services require participation from all team members.

MFT will conduct market research to ensure the contract requirements remain current with commercial standards, practices, and industry performance evaluation methods.



2.4.2 QAP Management Role.

The QAP will conduct, document, track, and analyze Contractor’s performance via regularly scheduled assessments.  The QAP will maintain assessment results as Past Performance Information and utilize it to prepare and support an annual CPARS reporting.  The Government will use assessment results, along with the Contractor’s submittals, to develop metrics to track Contractor’s overall compliance with contract terms and conditions.



2.4.3 QAP Files.

The primary QAP will develop and maintain a QAP file.  The QAP will apprise the CO of how the Government views the Contractor’s performance.  The QAP will maintain a hard and/or electronic copy QAP file.  The file must contain, at a minimum, the following documentation:



Appointment Letters; Evidence of Phase I and II Training; QAP Duties and Responsibilities Letter

Performance Plan

Contractor’s QCP

Assessment Documents (QAP Site Inspection List; QAP Monthly & Quarterly Reports; QAP Assessment Schedules; QAP & Contractor Site Inspection Checklist)

Records:  CDRs; Time & Material (T&M) Work Orders and Documentation

Monthly Invoices and Fund Logs

Site Inspection Trip Reports)

Contract including all attachments (Pricing Table, PWS, EIPS, Wage Determinations, etc.) as well as contract modifications, task orders, and task order modifications



2.4.4 Contractor Management Role.

The Contractor shall provide and maintain a QCP to ensure the contract services conform to the requirements of the PWS.  Contractor shall ensure that non-conforming contract services are identified, and corrected, and QCP is revised to prevent recurrence (See FAR 46.105, “Contractor Responsibilities”).  The Contractor shall update the plan as changes occur and submit the changes for review and acceptance to the Contract Administrator (CA) IAW the PWS.



2.4.5 Contractor Records.



2.4.5.1 Work Center Records.

Contractor shall develop, update and/or maintain accurate, complete, and readable work center records.  The Contractor shall update work center records within the timeframe specified in the PWS.  All BTS records and documents established and maintained by the Contractor are Government property and shall remain at the site and turned over to the QAP for disposition upon contract completion.  The Government requires electronic storage of records.  Contractor shall make provisions for Government access to databases, servers, media or other documentation.  



2.4.5.2 Contractor Inspection Records.

The Contractor shall keep records of inspections and make records available to the Government until contract completion and final settlement of any claims under this contract.



2.4.6 CO/Contract Administrator Management Role.

The CA and/or CO will annually review the QAP’s files and Contractor’s records to ensure assessment is properly conducted and documented, and Contractor performance is within acceptable levels.  The CO will document the review and provide feedback to the FC.  The CO will apprise the Contractor of how the Government views the Contractor’s performance, and the Contractor will apprise the Government of problems, if any, being experienced.  The Contractor will also notify the CO, in writing, of any work being performed, that they consider over and above the requirements of the contract.  The CO will take appropriate action to resolve any outstanding issues.



2.4.7 Performance Feedback.

The QAP is required to document, evaluate, and report Contractor’s performance.  On an annual basis, the QAP will complete a narrative summary of Contractor’s performance in CPARS and notify the CO.  The CPARS website is:  .  The QAP will accomplish Out-of-Cycle CPARS for any significant change in performance.  The QAP will also keep the FC or designee informed of all performance assessments.



2.4.7.1 Performance Elements.





2.4.7.2 Performance Ratings.  Contractor ratings and criteria are described below.  NOTE:  The QAP should basically start at the “Satisfactory” level and then revise their rating upward or downward based upon specific performance that either exceeded or failed to meet the contractual requirements.  Just “meeting” the requirement is Satisfactory.  To rate higher or lower, SPECIFICS are required, such as:  “Contractor exceeded the time for accomplishing work order by  completing routine work orders 85% of the time in four days or less – contract requires 10 days.”  In addition, the Government must receive some associated benefit.





2.5 Contract Performance Reviews. 



2.5.1 Pre-Award Management Controls.

Services acquisitions over $5M require review by SDO prior to release of the solicitation and contract to ensure service acquisitions are at least 50% or more performance-based (measured in dollars) and that finalized metrics and performance based requirements are included.



2.5.2 Post-Award Management Controls.



2.5.2.1 Initial Contract Performance Review.  The MFT will conduct a post award review no later than 30 days after the Contractor’s full assumption of contract workload.  The purpose of the review is to determine if the Contractor successfully completed transition (if applicable), is fully operational, and is satisfactorily performing within the cost, schedule and performance parameters required by the contract.  The MFT will conduct and document any information concerning contract execution and report to the SDO.  If the MFT finds negative variations in cost, schedule, staffing and/or performance, they must include an assessment of the root causes and a corrective action plan.  The review is to be documented in the contract file.  The SDO will waive the Initial Contract Performance Review if the Contractor is the prior incumbent.



2.5.2.2 Annual Execution Reviews.  The MFT will conduct annual reviews of all service acquisitions.  The report is submitted no later than the last working day of December for the prior year’s period of performance.  The MFT will conduct and document the annual performance review in the contract file and report to the SDO any negative variations in cost, schedule and/or other significant performance measures required by the contract.  If significant variations exist, include an explanation of the causes for the variance and an assessment of the Contractor’s corrective action plan.



3.0 Assessment.

In conducting assessment, QAP are to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating Contractor performance against the performance thresholds.  QAP shall base their evaluation on the end result, not the frequency or method of performance.  The Contractor must perform all services IAW the prescribed performance objectives stated in the Service Delivery Summary (SDS).  This performance plan identifies assessment procedures in concert with active application of the Contractor’s quality control procedures, to ensure acceptable Contractor performance.



3.1 Methods Used to Assess Contractor’s Performance.

The QAP will use the following methods to evaluate Contractor-provided services.



3.1.1 Periodic Surveillance.

The QAP will use this type of assessment by selecting samples (tasks) for evaluation on other than 100% inspections or on a statistically random basis.  An example of periodic surveillance is weekly inspections when QAP chooses the location and time in other than a random basis (i.e., reviewing PMIs performed).



3.1.2 100% Inspection.

The QAP will use this method of inspecting a requirement every time it occurs.  Use of this technique is appropriate when contract requirements have critical impact on mission of safety, occur infrequently or have stringent requirements (i.e., outside plant installations or manhole installations, or anything affecting flight or personnel safety).



3.1.3 Random Sampling.

The QAP will use this method to ensure the Government receives acceptable performance by the Contractor if a given percentage or number of scheduled inspections is found to be acceptable.  The QAP will evaluate randomly selected samples of activity to determine the acceptability of the entire requirement (i.e., a random review of service work orders completed).



3.1.4 Customer Complaints.

The QAP will use this method to fully validate information obtained through other sources, as well as performance in any area.  The QAP should furnish written instructions and customer training to each organization receiving the Contractor’s service.



3.2. Assessment Schedule. 

The QAP will develop an assessment schedule, based on this performance plan and PWS requirements.  The schedule will include the method/frequency of assessment.



3.2.1 Schedule Development.

The QAP will develop the schedule at contract award and on an annual basis thereafter using the SDS/PWS as a guide.  The QAP will complete the schedule no later than seven calendar days before the beginning of the period it covers (usually annually).  The QAP will provide the FC and the CA copies of the schedule.  The QAP will mark completed assessment schedules “For Official Use Only” and shall not show assessment schedules to the Contractor.



3.2.2 Schedule Changes.

The QAP will post changes to the assessment schedule promptly and will send copies to the FC and the CA.  The QAP will document the reason(s) for changes of the assessment schedule, and maintain the documentation in the QAP files with the corresponding changed assessment schedule.



3.3 Assessment of SDS Items.

The QAP will conduct assessments IAW with projected assessment schedule outlined in paragraph 3.2 above for an effective quality assurance program.   requirements may require deviations from the assessment schedule.  The QAP shall perform assessment as close to the schedule as possible and document assessment as it is conducted.  The QAP will conduct assessment of the Contractor’s performance by determining whether or not the performance meets the thresholds contained in the contract.  Assessment documentation will include as a minimum, the date and location the assessment was conducted, results of the assessment (acceptable or unacceptable), PWS paragraph number referencing the requirement, a short description of the requirement being surveyed, applicable remarks, and signature of QAP conducting the assessment.  These assessments will serve as the official record of the inspection for auditing purposes and will be retained until the end of the contract period.  The CO will provide disposition instructions.  When QAP determine that Contractor performance is unacceptable, they will record the specific reason for the unacceptable performance.



3.4 Assessment of Non-SDS Items.

The Government has the right to inspect all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract.  Therefore, QAP have the right to conduct assessment for SDS items and non-SDS items as well.  When the QAP identifies unacceptable performance on non-SDS items, the QAP will follow the procedures in section 3.8 of this performance plan, entitled Process for Unacceptable Performance.



3.5 Customer Feedback.

Any personnel that observe questionable services, incomplete, not performed, or performed improperly, should immediately contact the QAP.  QAP will receive, document, and validate or invalidate all complaints.  If the complaint is invalid, the QAP will contact the complainant and explain why the complaint was invalid.  QAP will fully document the resolution for each complaint.  QAP will notify the Contractor of all valid complaints.  If the Contractor challenges the validity of any complaint, and the QAP and Contractor cannot come to agreement, the complaint in question shall be forwarded to the CO for resolution.  Complaints will be tracked and if the performance threshold is exceeded, the QAP will notify the CO in writing. In turn, the CO will notify the Contractor and take appropriate action.  The process shall accommodate and document positive feedback as well.



3.6 QAP End of Quarter Report.

QAP will submit an assessment report to the CO and FC no later than the first week of the first month of the next quarter.  The report will identify the number of assessments scheduled and conducted in the previous quarter along with the number of unacceptable performances observed, the number of CDRs issued, number of valid complaints, any significant Contractor performance discrepancies, and a rating of the Contractor’s overall performance.  The QAP will sign, date and provide a copy of the report to the CO and FC.



3.7 Method of Acceptance of Services.  The Contractor will submit invoices via the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system for acceptable services tendered IAW the contract.  The QAP will act as the “inspector” of services and ensure that all backup documentation is attached.  Backup documentation includes invoices for material; work orders and time sheets for time and materials; and certified payroll to support Davis Bacon Work.  After the QAP inspects, the Resource Advisor accepts, and DFAS will process the invoice.



3.8 Process for Unacceptable Performance.  When the Contractor’s performance is deemed unacceptable, QAP will determine the cause of the unacceptable performance and forward his/her findings to the CO.



3.8.1 Government-Caused.

If any Government action, or lack of action, caused or contributed to the unacceptable performance, the Contractor will not be held responsible for the unacceptable performance.  The QAP will take action to ensure Government action, or lack of action, does not interfere with the Contractor’s performance in the future.  The QAP will completely document the circumstance.



3.8.2 Not Government-Caused.

When the unacceptable performance is not the result of Government action, or lack of action, QAP will promptly notify the Contractor and direct the Contractor to re-perform the service, if possible, without additional cost to the Government.  If the Contractor challenges the validity of the QAP’s unacceptable assessment finding, and the QAP and Contractor cannot come to an agreement, the matter shall be referred to the CO for resolution.  The QAP may issue a CDR (via the CO) to the Contractor to assure corrective action is taken.  The Contractor shall be required to return all completed CDRs to the CO no later than the suspense date indicated on the CDR.  Unacceptable performance re-performed by the Contractor shall still count as unacceptable performance.






3.9 CO Notification.



3.9.1 Major Finding.

If at any time QAP identifies a condition as having a significant adverse effect on the quality of the activity, such as those stated below, QAP will document their findings and notify the CO immediately in writing (Email is acceptable).  Any of the following could result in the issuance of a CDR by the QAP:



Contractor failure to meet a Performance Threshold.

Failure to provide adequate corrective action to preclude reoccurrence of Government identified findings.

Failure to provide corrective action to deficiencies identified by the QAP within a prescribed suspense period.

Any failure to comply with to security regulations.

Any failure to comply with safety regulations.



3.9.2 Minor Finding.

If the QAP finds that the Contractor has deviated from established standards, but the deviation has little bearing on the service provided, the QAP will document the finding in a memorandum for record (MFR).  The QAP is not required to immediately notify the CO, but will forward the MFR as an attachment to the monthly report.  However, if the QAP repeatedly identifies the same minor finding, it may be an indication that a major finding is occurring because the Contractor has not taken proper steps to prevent recurrence.  In this case, the QAP will notify the CO in writing.



3.10 Remedies for Unacceptable Performance.



3.10.1 If Services Do Not Conform.

In accordance with the contract’s Inspection of Services Clause(s), if any of the services do not conform to the contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount.



3.10.2 If Services Cannot Be Corrected by Re-Performance.

When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements and reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.  This may include a reduction in payment to reflect the total non-performance period.



3.10.3 If Contractor Fails to Promptly Perform Services Again.

If the Contractor fails to promptly perform services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may by contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service; decrement invoice as stated in the PWS related to performance; or terminate the contract.



3.1.1 Periodic Surveillance.

The QAP will use this type of assessment by selecting samples (tasks) for evaluation on other than 100% inspections or on a statistically random basis.  An example of periodic surveillance is weekly inspections when QAP chooses the location and time in other than a random basis (i.e., reviewing PMIs performed).



3.1.2 100% Inspection.

The QAP will use this method of inspecting a requirement every time it occurs.  Use of this technique is appropriate when contract requirements have critical impact on mission of safety, occur infrequently or have stringent requirements (i.e., outside plant installations or manhole installations, or anything affecting flight or personnel safety).



3.1.3 Random Sampling.

The QAP will use this method to ensure the Government receives acceptable performance by the Contractor if a given percentage or number of scheduled inspections is found to be acceptable.  The QAP will evaluate randomly selected samples of activity to determine the acceptability of the entire requirement (i.e., a random review of service work orders completed).



3.1.4 Customer Complaints.

The QAP will use this method to fully validate information obtained through other sources, as well as performance in any area.  The QAP should furnish written instructions and customer training to each organization receiving the Contractor’s service.

Performance Element

Description

Quality of Service

Assess the Contractor’s conformance to contract requirements, specifications, and standards of good workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety health standards).

Schedule

Assess the timeliness of the Contractor against the completion of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedule, administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance).

Business Relations

Assess the integration and coordination of all activities needed to execute the contract, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the Contractor’s history or reasonable and cooperative behavior, customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts, and whether the Contractor met small/small disadvantaged and woman owned business participation goals.

Management of Key Personnel

Assess the Contractor’s performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing when necessary, key personnel

Cost

Assess the Contractor’s ability to control costs associated with applicable Time and Materials purchases.



Performance Rating

Criteria

Exceptional

Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many of the government’s benefits.  The contractual performance of the element or sub- element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor were highly effective.

Very Good

Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some of the government benefits.  The contractual performance element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor were highly effective. 

Satisfactory

Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor appear or were satisfactory. 

Marginal

Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the Contractor has not yet identified corrective actions.  The Contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. 

Unsatisfactory

Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains serious problem(s) for which the Contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

are due no later than the date/time specified on block 9 of the RFP.  Late proposals will not be considered.  This letter is supplemental to the
instructions provided in Section L of the RFP.  Should a conflict exist, Section L will take precedence over this letter.

2.  This RFP is set aside 100% for 8(a) Small Businesses.  Only 8(a) domestic businesses are eligible to participate.  Foreign participation is
limited to the subcontractor level; this solicitation is provided to foreign-owned businesses only in order that subcontracting opportunities
may be pursued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 517110 and size standard is 1500 employees.

3.  Each offeror is required to submit their proposal as specified in Section L of the RFP (and addendums.  Your offer may be considered “non-
responsive” or “not technically acceptable” if you omit required information from your proposal.  Additional guidance is provided below as a
convenience only:

    a.  The Pricing Table (RFP Attachment 1) is to be submitted in hard copies as well as on a CD using the spreadsheet file included with the
solicitation.  You are highly encouraged to STUDY the entire RFP document to ensure proper allocation of material and labor costs BEFORE
completing the Pricing Table.  For example, the pricing for some installation items must include the costs for all the material required to
complete the installation, while others are separate costs.  Additionally, some items require mixed labor skills (both Service Contract Act and
Davis Bacon Act may apply).

    b.  You must complete all applicable blocks on the SF 33 and certifications (even if the response is “none.”  As of 01 Jan 2005,
certifications and representations must be completed through the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA) on an annual basis

the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for efficiency.  The Government reserves the right to exclude from the
competitive range any proposal without a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award.  Discussions may be conducted if necessary.
However, the Government will award without discussion if no discussion is necessary, therefore offerors should submit their best proposal
initially as it may be the one selected.  If negotiations are required, final proposal revisions will be requested from all offerors still
within the competitive range.
