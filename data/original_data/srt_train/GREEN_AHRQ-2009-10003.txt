REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) No. AHRQ-2009-10003

                             Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Resource Center for Health IT (NRC)


PART I - THE SCHEDULE

SECTION A - SOLICITATION FORM


You are invited to submit a proposal to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) for Request for Proposal (RFP) No. AHRQ-2009-
10003, entitled “Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) National Resource Center for Health IT (NRC).”  Your proposal must be
developed and submitted in accordance with the requirements and instructions of this RFP.

It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made.  The type of contract is task order (indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity).  Individual
Task orders (delivery orders) written against the base contract may be firm fixed price, cost reimbursement, or performance-based cost plus
award fee.

The period of performance will be one year with 4 one-year options.

AHRQ anticipates awarding contracts under this RFP for each of four separate domain areas:

      Domain 1 – Support for Health IT Program Management, Guidance, Assessment and Planning

      Domain 2 – Health IT Technical Assistance, Content Development, Program Related Projects and Studies

      Domain 3 – Health IT Dissemination, Communication and Marketing

      Domain 4 – Health IT Portal Infrastructure Management and Website Design and Usability Support.


The Statement of Work (Section C) describes the four domains of this requirement.  Offerors may choose to submit proposals for one or more of
the domains, but are strongly encouraged to submit proposals only for those domains in which they are particularly qualified.  Resultant
contracts will specify the domain under which the contractor is eligible to receive task orders.


It is AHRQ’s desire to award contracts to a mixture of large and small businesses.  While the RFP is classified as full and open competition,
AHRQ’s intent is to reserve some awards in some of the domains for small business as follows:

Domain 1 – Unrestricted
Domain 2 – 20% of total contract awards reserved for small business
Domain 3 – 50% of total contract awards reserved for small business
Domain 4 – 20% of total contract awards reserved for small business

Should an insufficient number of small businesses be deemed to be technically qualified in each domain, AHRQ reserves the right to award to
other than small business to reach the required number of awards needed in each domain.   AHRQ anticipates awarding approximately 3-6, but no
more than 10 contract awards in each of the four domains.  This is an estimate only and AHRQ reserves the right to award more or fewer contracts
per domain area.

There will be multiple North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this acquisition.  The small business size standard will
vary with the different domains.
See Section L.15 of this solicitation for the NAICS codes for the separate domains.

PLEASE NOTE:  A SEPARATE PROPOSAL MUST BE SUBMITTED FOR EACH DOMAIN FOR WHICH YOU WISH TO BE CONSIDERED.  THE COVER PAGE OF THE PROPOSAL SHOULD
CLEARLY SHOW THE DOMAIN NUMBER AND YOUR BUSINESS SIZE CLASSIFICATION.  EACH PROPOSAL SHOULD BE SUBMITTED IN A SEPARATE MAILING/PACKAGE WITH THE
DOMAIN NUMBER CLEARLY INDICATED SO IT CAN BE SENT TO THE CORRECT REVIEW PANEL.  ATTACHMENTS 1 THROUGH 4 PROVIDE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC PROPOSAL
SPECIFICATIONS.

Each proposal should include the following for the domain for which you wish to be considered:

A.    Technical Proposal (See Section L.9) (Original and 12 hard copies plus two electronic copies on CD)
B.    Past Performance Information (See Section L.10) (Original and 2 hard copies plus two electronic copies on CD)
C.    Business Proposal (See Section L.11) (Original and 5 hard copies plus two electronic copies on CD)
D.    Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan (See Section L.12) (Original and one hard copy plus one electronic copy on CD)

Your technical proposal must be concisely written and should be limited to 100 typewritten pages (double-spaced), exclusive of personnel
qualifications (i.e., resume, etc., see Section L.9 for additional details).  This limitation is for administrative purposes only and exceeding
the limitation shall not, of itself, be considered a basis for rejection of your proposal.

As part of the business proposal, offerors shall provide an original and five (5) copies of their cost/price proposal, only to the extent that
it shall include:

1.  Certified, unloaded, labor rates for individuals expected to work on a project of this size and nature.  Labor classifications for the
specific Domains are at Attachments 1 through 4.

2.  Documentation indicating that the offeror has a cost accounting system in place which allows for the collection, tracking and reporting of
all costs under a cost reimbursement-type contract.

3.  Documentation that the offeror has a current indirect cost rate agreement in place with a federal agency or that is in the process of
obtaining or revising such an agreement.  A copy of the indirect cost rate agreement or the proposed rate agreement must be provided.

Your proposal must provide the full name of your company, the address, including county, Tax Identification Number (TIN), DUN and Bradstreet
No., and if different, the address to which payment should be mailed.

It is requested that a completed Proposal Intent form be submitted by January 21, 2009              indicating your intent to submit a proposal
under this RFP.  The form also allows you to be included on a bidders list (that will be posted as an amendment to this RFP) for possible
networking and collaboration with other interested offerors.

The following information is only applicable if and when a task order award is made over the $550,000 threshold.  The AHRQ recommended goal (as
a percentage of total planned subcontracting dollars for the base period) is 19% for Small Businesses, which shall include at least 5.5% (as a
percentage of total contract value for the base period) for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, at least 5% (as a percentage of total planned
subcontract dollars for the base period) for Women-Owned Small Businesses, and at least 3% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars
for the base period) for HUBZone Small Businesses and at least 3% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base period) for
Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  THESE GOALS REPRESENT AHRQ’S EXPECTATION OF THE MINIMUM LEVEL FOR SUBCONTRACTING.

PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN SECTION L.9 OF THE SOLICITATION.

                                                 SECTION B-SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS

B.1   BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES

      The purpose of these contracts and subsequent task orders is to maintain, serve, and support the AHRQ National Resource Center for Health
      Information Technology (NRC).


      See Section C for a complete description.

B.2   PRICE/COSTS

      This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract will remain in effect for a one-year base period with four one-year option
      periods.  Option years may be exercised by the Government by issuance of a unilateral contract modification.  Each Task Order will specify
      its period of performance.  Task Orders can be awarded with options, which would allow them to exceed 12 months, but no more than 60 months
      if all potential options were exercised.  For each successful award, there will be a one time “minimum guarantee” award amount of $25,000
      during the life of the contract which includes all option years, if exercised.  This amount can only be claimed at the end of the contract
      period and only if the Contractor has submitted proposals on all Task Orders offered to it during the years for which the Contractor is
      eligible.  The ceiling amount for all contracts for the entire 5 years (which includes options) is $75,000,000.  Individual ceiling amounts
      will be established for each base contract awarded based on the anticipated level of work required under each Domain.


      Task Orders will be awarded under this contract and prices/costs will be negotiated individually for each Task Order under this contract at
      time of award of the Task Order.  Task Orders may be cost-reimbursement, firm fixed-price, or performance-based cost plus award fee.
      Specific terms and conditions regarding reimbursement and payment will be specifically delineated in each Task Order.


B.3   PROPOSED LABOR RATES FOR TASK ORDERS

      Offerors shall provide appropriate staff for work on task orders.

      For purposes of evaluating proposals for the base contract awards, offerors shall propose direct labor rates or ranges of rates for the
      categories of labor identified for each domain for which the offeror is submitting a proposal.  These rates will be used to determine
      reasonableness of cost/price.  Refer to the appropriate attachment (Attachments 1 through 4) for the labor categories specific for each
      domain.

      These labor categories are examples of the primary labor sources anticipated as necessary to perform contract tasks.  When a Request for
      Task Order Proposal is issued, actual labor rates will be required in the offeror’s proposal.

      Note: Direct labor rates only shall be provided… NOT loaded rates with fringe benefits, overhead, general and administrative costs, etc.
      (Ranges in rates may be provided)

B.4   PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO DIRECT COSTS

a.    Unless otherwise provided by this contract or unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, the costs of the following items or
      activities shall be unallowable as direct costs:

      (1)   Acquisition, by purchase or lease, of any interest in real property;

      (2)   Rearrangement or alteration of facilities;

      (3)   Purchase or lease of any item of general purpose-office furniture or office equipment regardless of dollar value. (General purpose
                       equipment is defined as any items of personal property which are usable for purposes other than research, such as office
                       equipment and furnishings, pocket calculators, etc.);

      (4)   Accountable Government property (defined as both real and personal property with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, with a life
                       expectancy of more than two years) and "sensitive items" (defined and listed in the Contractor's Guide for Control of
                       Government Property, 1990, regardless of acquisition value;

      (5)   Travel to attend general scientific meetings;

      (6)   Foreign Travel;

      (7)   Any costs incurred prior to the contract's effective date;

      (8)   Rental of meeting rooms not otherwise expressly paid for by the contract;


      (9)   Any formal subcontract arrangements not otherwise expressly provided for in the contract

                 (10)  Consultant fees in excess of $1000/day;


            (11)       Information Technology hardware or software.  The Contractor is required to provide its own IT equipment and software
                 adequate to fully satisfy all operational requirements of the Task Orders awarded under this contract; and

            (12)       Food /Beverages.

     b. This contract is subject to the provisions of Public Law (P.L.) 99-234 which amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to
        provide that contractor costs for travel, including lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, shall be allowable only to the
        extent that they do not exceed the amount allowed for Federal employees.  The Contractor, therefore, shall invoice and be reimbursed for
        all travel costs in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 31.205-46.

B.5     TASK ORDERS

Individual Task Orders will be issued as requirements occur.  Task Orders will specify work to be performed and will reflect the labor rates of
the proposed staff in effect when the Task Order is issued.  The terms and conditions set forth in the contract will always apply.  Task Orders
may be negotiated and awarded on a cost reimbursement, firm fixed price or performance-based cost plus award fee basis.  The pricing
arrangement, the cost or price and the period of performance will be established for each Task order.  The period of performance of a Task Order
may extend past the IDIQ contract’s expiration date. It will be the determination of AHRQ on how to issue the Request for Task Order Proposals
(RFTOPs) and for which domain.  For those domains with large and small business areas, the decision will be made depending on the project to
issue the Task Order on a small business set-aside basis or under both the large and small business areas.




















                                              SECTION C – DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT


Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall be required to furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel,
material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the Statement of Work, Attachment 5.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) requires support for the
Agency’s Health Information Technology portfolio by maintaining, serving as, and supporting the AHRQ National Resource Center for Health
Information Technology (NRC) and its associated activities.

AHRQ will award multiple IDIQ contracts as a result of this solicitation.  To the maximum extent possible, each awardee will be given a fair
opportunity to be considered for each Task Order for which it is eligible to compete.  AHRQ will determine which Contractor will perform
individual task orders based on the evaluation criteria contained in the Request for Task Order.

By GAO rule, the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task orders issued under
multiple-award contracts.   Accordingly, when the need for a Task Order arises, the Government will first determine if it is possible to limit
the competition to small businesses within the domain if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two capable,
responsible small business concerns and if the award can be made at a fair market price.  Otherwise, it is anticipated that all contractors
within the domain will be given the opportunity to compete for the Task Order.

As requirements arise, the Contracting Officer shall issue Request for Task Order Proposals (RFTOP) to Contractors who have been awarded a
contract with eligibility in the specific domain(s) applicable to the task.  Each Contractor shall have the opportunity to respond with a Task
Order Proposal in accordance with the instructions provided.  The RFTOP shall include a statement of work, schedule of deliverables, technical
evaluation criteria and additional instructions as needed for each individual Task Order.

Each eligible Contractor will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order.  However, the Government may issue a sole
source RFTOP if one of more of the following conditions exist:

1.  when the dollar value of the order is less than $2500; or

2.  when the need for the service is of such urgency that providing all Contractors an opportunity would not be in the best interest of the
Government; or

3.  when only one Contractor is capable of providing the service required at the level of quality required because the service is unique or
highly specialized; or

4.  when the Task Order is a logical follow-on to an Order already issued; or

5.  when required to fulfill a minimum order.

Requests for Task Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer primarily electronically through e-mail or internet but they can also be
issued by facsimile or mail.  Contractors are required to have internet or external electronic mail capabilities.  When a RFTOP is issued, the
Contractor shall provide a proposal containing both technical and cost/price information for performing the required services.  Some RFTOPs will
contain quick turn-around due dates.



                                                   SECTION D – PACKAGING, MARKING AND SHIPPING

All deliverables required under this contract shall be packaged, marked, and shipped in accordance with Government specifications.  The
Contractor shall guarantee that all required materials shall be delivered in immediate usable and acceptable condition.


                                                      SECTION E – INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE

E.1   INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE

      a.    The contracting officer or the duly authorized representative will perform inspection and acceptance of materials and services to be
           provided.

      b.    For the purpose of this SECTION the Government Project Officer is the authorized technical representative of the contracting
           officer.

      c.    Inspection and acceptance will be performed at:

                 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
                 540 Gaither Road
                 Rockville, Maryland  20850

                                                    SECTION H – SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

H.1   RELEASE AND USE AND COPYRIGHT OF DATA FIRST PRODUCED FROM WORK PERFORMED UNDER THIS CONTRACT

(a)  Release and Use – Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section
H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or
recorded product based on such data.

(b)  Release and Use – Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded
participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors
with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that

      No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of
      activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless
      such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other
      form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its
      publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses
developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --

      (1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project
      and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  AHRQ will, within 6 monts of the receipt of any proposed publication,
      presentation, or any other disclosure of materials derived from information collected or produced for this contract, use best effort to
      review the proposed report, presentation, or other text to assure:


        (A) identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been
           obtained;
        (B) the confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not
           violated; and
        (C)      the quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.


      The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ
      within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.

      (2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b)(1) above,
      if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1)(C) above:


      (A)   the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use
           of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory
           standards referenced in condition (1)(C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
       (B)  the Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral
           presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:

           THIS presentation/ publication/or other product is derived from work supported under a contract with THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE
           RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  However, this presentation/ publication/or other product HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED by the agency.


      (3)   If the AHRQ Project Officer does not provide written conditions or approvals by the end of the six month period following submission
      of a request to publish a report or to make a presentation or other disclosure of material derived from work performed for AHRQ-funded
      research, the Contractor may publish, present, or otherwise disclose this material subject to the restrictions of Section 903(c).  However,
      the Contractor must print prominently on the report or any portion of it which is released, or state prior to any oral or other disclosure
      of the material derived from work performed under this contract, the following disclaimer:


           THIS presentation/ publication/or other product is derived from work supported under a contract with THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE
           RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  However, this presentation/ publication/or other product HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED by the agency.

(c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or
other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this
contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:

           IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH THIS REPORT, PRESENTATION, OR OTHER FORM OF DISCLOSURE IS BASED IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAW,
           SECTION 934(c) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c).  NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES
           SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT.  ANY CONFIDENTIAL
           IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT
           WAS PROVIDED.


(d)  Copyright – Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of
data, AHRQ, through its Contracting Officer, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c)(1)(i) to the Contractor to establish claim to
copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract that
are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works.  When claim to copyright
is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship
(including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for
registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office.  In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to grant to AHRQ, and others
acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works,
distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.  A description of this license will be
incorporated into the copyright notices required above.

(e)  Subcontracts.  Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the
Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may not
further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor.  No clause may be included to diminish the Government’s stated
requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this contract.

H.2    LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section H.1 of
this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision are
necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities.  Records of the Contractor's performance, including the
Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an
element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews.






H.3   SUBCONTRACTS

The contractor must include in any subcontracts executed or used to provide the support specified in this contract the terms of requirements
H.1, H.2, H.4, H.5, H.6, and H.7.  These requirements are to be included without substantive alteration, and no clause may be included to
diminish these requirements.

Award of any subcontract is subject to the written approval of the Contracting Officer upon review of the supporting documentation as required
by FAR Clause 52.215-12, Subcontractor Cost or Pricing Data, of the General Clauses incorporated into this contract.  A copy of the signed
subcontract shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.

H.4   LATE PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT

Late payment of debts owed the Government by the Contractor, arising from whatever cause, under this contract/order shall bear interest at a
rate or rates to be established in accordance with the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual.  For purposes of this provision, late payments are

of:

      a.    The basis of indebtedness.

      b.    The amount due.

      c.    The fact that interest will be applied if payment is not received within 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice.

      d.    The approximate interest rate that will be charged.

H.5   PRIVACY ACT

The Privacy Act clauses cited in Section I (FAR 52.224-1 and 52.224-2) are applicable to the consultant records kept by the Contractor for the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

You are hereby notified that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)) to
the same extent as employees of the Department.  The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee is aware that he/she can be subjected
to criminal penalties for violations of the Act.  Disposition instructions:  Records are to be destroyed after contract closeout is completed
and final payment is made and in accordance with IRS regulations.

H.6   SALARY RATE LIMITATION HHSAR 352-270-15 (JANUARY 2008)

 Pursuant to the applicable HHS appropriations acts cited in the table below, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct
salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the salary level in effect on the date the expense is incurred as shown in the table below.

For purposes of the salary limitation, the terms direct salary, salary, and institutional base salary have the same meaning and are collectively
referred to as direct salary in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an
individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Direct salary
excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe
benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals performing under subcontracts. However, it does not apply to fees paid to consultants. If
this is a multiple-year contract, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not
paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is
incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract funding.

H.10  SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE

This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or
Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include
reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned
or Department-funded Web site.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies
(EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of,
the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability
to access government information and services.

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified
at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Board’s Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to
implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information
Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Board’s standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48,
located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable
regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR).

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text,
audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to
access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or
consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable

           accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted.  The offeror further certifies that if such
           status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately.

           with 48 CFR, Subpart 9903.202-1, the offeror is not yet required to submit a Disclosure Statement.  The offeror further certifies

           connection with proposals submitted before expiration of the 90-day period following the cost accounting period in which the monetary
           exemption was exceeded.












II.   Cost Accounting Standards - Eligibility for Modified Contract Coverage

                                                        K.6.   ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

      The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse
      of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in
      some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development
      services are provided to children.


                                               CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor
facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood
development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either
directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's
services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply
to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers
whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the
provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an
administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and
will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain
provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

                 (i)   Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modification or revisions, so as to reach the Government
                       office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation.  If no time is specified in the
                       solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that
                       proposal or revision is due.

                       exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is

                            receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

                       (3)   It is the only proposal received.

                       (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the
                       Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

                 (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that
                       installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral
                       testimony or statements of Government personnel.

                       (iv)  If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received
                       at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government
                       requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be
                       extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes
                       resume.

                 (v)   Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award.  Oral proposals in response to oral
                       solicitations may be withdrawn orally.  If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via
                       facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, “Facsimile
                       Proposals.”  Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative’s
                       identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

                       (4)   Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of
                            items.

                       (5)   Offerors shall submit proposals submitted in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted
                            by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency
                            Offers, is included in the solicitation.

                       (6)   Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and
                            may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.

                       (7)   Offers may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.

                       (8)   Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award.  Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the
                            Contracting Officer.

      (d)   Offer expiration date.  Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation
           cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror).


      (e)   Restriction on disclosure and use of data.  Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the
           public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall —

            (1)  Mark the title page with the following legend:

                 “This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or
                 disclosed–in whole or in part–for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal.” If, however, a contract is awarded to this
                 offeror as a result of–or in connection with– the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate,
                 use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s
                 right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  The data subject to
                 this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and

            (2)  Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

                 “Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.”

      (f)   Contract award.

            (1)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose
                 proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

            (2)  The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.

            (3)  The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

            (4)  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals
                 have been determined to be within the competitive range.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals
                 that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the
                 Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an
                 efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the
                 offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

            (5)  The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost
                 or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

            (6)  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in
                 the Government’s best interest to do so.

            (7)  Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

            (8)  The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line
                 items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more
                 contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis
                 techniques.  A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable
                 risk to the Government.

            (9)  If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating
                 performance or schedule risk.

            (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in
                 the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.



            (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if
                 applicable:

                 (i)   The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.

                 (ii)  The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance
                       information on the debriefed offeror.

                 (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection

                   iv) A summary of the rationale for award


                    v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

                   vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offerors as to whether source-selection procedures set
                       forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

Alternate I (October 1977).  As prescribed in 15.209(a)(1), substitute the following paragraph (f)(4) for paragraph (f)(4) of the basic
provision:

     (f)    (4)  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals
have been determined to be within the competitive range.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would
otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit
the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated
proposals.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.


L.4   TYPE OF CONTRACT (APRIL 1984) (FAR 52.216-1)


      It is anticipated that multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ or Task Order) awards will be made from this solicitation and

      It is requested that if an offeror intends to submit a proposal to this solicitation that the attached Proposal Intent Form be completed
      and returned to the address indicated by the date indicated.  The submission of the intent form is not binding on an offeror to submit a

L.9   GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

      Introduction

      The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  The Government
      requires a minimum acceptance period of 120 days.


      A separate proposal consisting of a Cover Page, Technical Proposal, Past Performance, Business Proposal and Small Disadvantaged Business
      Participation Plan (in the appropriate number of copies) must be submitted (and properly identified) for each Domain for which the offeror
      submits a proposal.  Proposals for each Domain should be packaged separately for ease in distribution to the appropriate Peer Review
      Committee.


       a.   Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ or Task Order)
      contracts will be awarded.  In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include
      the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by
      Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

      b.        Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the
      offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover
      letter of this solicitation.  Proposals will be typewritten, reproduced on letter sized paper and will be legible in all required copies.


      c.        Separation of Technical, Past Performance Information, and Business Proposal:  The proposal shall be in 4 separate parts. To
      expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:


      I.    COVER PAGE:  The Cover Page shall include the solicitation title, the solicitation number, name of organization, author(s) of
                 technical proposal, point of contact information for questions on the proposal, and shall indicate whether the proposal is the
                 original or a copy.  Indicate the Domain number(s) proposed and the business size of the organization (such as large business,
                 small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, etc.).  The Cover Page must indicate the Domain
                 number for the proposal so it can be sent to the proper Technical Proposal Peer Review Committee.

           II.         TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  See Technical Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.10). Please mark as original or copy.


           III.        PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: See Past Performance Information Instructions for format (L.11)


           IV.         BUSINESS PROPOSAL:  See Business Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.13).


           V.          SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN See Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan Instructions for
                 recommended format (L.12).

           Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and
           concurrently with, evaluation of the other.


      d.    Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M,
           Evaluation/Award Criteria.

      e.    Potential Award Without Discussion:  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting
           Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

      f.    Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your
           proposal will become part of the official contract file.

      g.    Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a
           complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.
           Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted.

      h.    Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks
           to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the
           principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of
           the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

            Therefore:

           (1)   The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the
                 Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

            (2)  Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.

            (3)  The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a
                 discussion as to whether to award a contract.

            (4)  Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

            (5)  The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:


                 -to the cognizant audit agency and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for auditing;
                 -to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
                 -to respond to Congressional inquiries; and
                       -to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.

            In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals
           are requested to disclose their social security number.

           Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and
           efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is
           provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

      i.    The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.  It is also brought to your
           attention that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public
           funds in connection with this or any acquisition action.

           The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial
           prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

L.10  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

      The technical proposal shall contain an original and twelve (12) hard copies, plus two electronic copies on CD.   A technical proposal must
      be submitted for each Domain for which the offeor is submitting a proposal.  The technical proposal described below shall be limited to 100
      pages not including biographic sketches, with no less than a 11 point font, double-spaced (lists of deliverables, person loading charts,
      and similar materials need not be double-spaced, so long as they are legible). Brief biographic sketches or CVs (less than ten pages in
      length) providing the relevant qualifications necessary for this effort are only required for key personnel.   The technical proposal shall
      not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, labor mix, materials,
      subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be
      evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of
      these instructions. Lengthy proposals and voluminous appendices are neither needed nor desired as they are difficult to read and evaluate
      and may indicate the offeror’s inability to concisely state their proposal. Appendices are to be provided electronically in MS Office
      format on CD, in the same quantity as the technical proposal.


      a.    Recommended Technical Proposal Format

           The offeror’s proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a
           detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work.  Technical proposals shall not merely paraphrase the requirements of
           the Agency’s scope of work or parts thereof, or use of phrases such as “will comply” or “standard techniques will be employed.”  The
           technical proposal must include a detailed description of the techniques and procedures to be used in achieving the proposed end
           results in compliance with the requirements of the Agency’s scope of work.

            (1)  Cover Page:  The name of the proposing organization, list of proposed subcontractors, author(s) of the technical proposal, the
                 RFP number and the title of the RFP should appear on the cover. The cover page must also include the DUNS and TIN as well as a
                 point of contact and contact information.  Indicate the Domain number proposed and the business size of the proposing
                 organization.  One (1) manually signed original copy of the proposal and the number of copies specified in the RFP cover letter
                 are required.

            (2)  Table of Contents:  Provide sufficient detail so that all important elements of the proposal can be located readily.

            (3)  Introduction:  This should be a one or two page summary outlining the proposed work, your interest in submitting a proposal,
                 and the importance of this effort in relation to your overall operation.

            (4)  Technical Discussion:  The offeror shall prepare a technical discussion which addresses evaluation criteria appropriate to the
                 Domain for which the proposal is being submitted.   Please see the Domain Proposal Specifications which includes a list of the
                 specific evaluation criteria for each Domain.  The offeror shall further state that no deviations or exceptions to the Statement
                 of Work (SOW) are taken.

L.11  PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION


      Offerors shall submit the following information (original and 3 copies) as part of their proposal for both the offeror and proposed major
      subcontractors.  A Past Performance proposal must be submitted for each Domain for which the offeror is submitting a proposal.








      (1)   A list of the last five (5) contracts and subcontracts completed (most relevant or most related) during the past three years and all
      contracts and subcontracts currently in process.  Reference contracts and subcontracts completed during the past three years and include
      recently completed and ongoing work directly related to the requirements of this acquisition. Contracts listed may include those entered
      into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers.  Offerors that are newly formed entities
      without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required for all key personnel.  Include the following information for
      each contract and subcontract:
                       a: Name of contracting activity
                       b: Contract number
                       c: Contract type
                       d: Total contract value
                       e: Contract work
                       f:  Contracting Officer and telephone number
                       g: Program Manager and telephone number
                       h: Administrative Contracting Officer, if different from item f, and telephone number
                       i: List of major subcontracts


      (2)   The offeror should provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified in (1) above and
      corrective actions taken to resolve those problems.  Offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified
      contracts.  General performance information will be obtained from the references.


      (3)   The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that may indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for
      developing and producing the product or service required.  Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that
      received the award or certification.  Describe when the award or certification was bestowed.  If the award or certification is over three
      years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply.


      (4)   Each offeror will be evaluated on his/her performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services.
      Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offeror’s relative
      rankings will be compared to assure best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of
      performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  References other than those identified by the
      offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received used in the evaluation of the offeror’s past performance.

      (5)   The offeror must provide related past performance of the proposed Project Director.   Reference contracts and subcontracts completed
      during the past three years and include recently completed and ongoing work directly related to the requirements of this acquisition.








      The attached Past Performance Questionnaire and Contractor Performance Form shall be completed by those organizations listed in (1) above.
      The evaluation forms shall be completed and forwarded directly to:


                             Sharon Williams
                             Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality

      Evaluation forms must be received by the date and time listed in order to be included in the review process.  It is the responsibility of
      the offeror to ensure that these documents are forwarded to the Contracting Officer.


   L.12     SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN:


      In accordance with FAR Part 15.304(c)4, the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns in performance of the
      contract shall be evaluated in unrestricted acquisitions expected to exceed a total estimated cost of $550,000 ($1,000,000 for
      construction) subject to certain limitations (see FAR 19.201 and 19.1202).


      A.    All offerors, regardless of size, shall submit the following information in original and 2 copies for each Domain for which the
           offeror is submitting a proposal.

            A plan on the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business concerns in performance of the contract.  Participation in
           performance of the contract includes the work expected to be performed by SDB concern(s).  This can include SDB (as prime
           contractor), joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and subcontracts.  Include the following information in SDB participation plans:


                 1.    The extent of an offeror’s commitment to use SDB concerns.  Commitment should be as specific as possible, i.e., are
                       subcontract arrangements already in place, letters of commitment, etc.  Enforceable commitments will be weighted more
                       heavily than non-enforceable ones.

                 2.    Specifically identify the SDB concerns with point of contact and phone number.

                 3.    The complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform.

                 4.    Realism for the use of SDB in the proposal.

                 5.    Past performance of the Offeror in complying with subcontracting plans for SDB concerns.

                 6.    Targets expressed as dollars and percentage of total contract value for each participating SDB; which will be
                       incorporated into and become part of any resulting contract.

                 7.    The extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the total acquisition.


      B.    SDB participation information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which
           offeror’s relative rankings will be compared to assure the best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information
           that demonstrates realistic commitments to use SDB concerns relative to the size and complexity of the acquisition under
           consideration.  The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the offeror.  Also, references other than those
           identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of
           the offeror’s commitment to SDB participation.

           shall be completed and signed by an official authorized to bind your organization.  This section shall be made a part of the original
           business proposal.

C.          Small Business Subcontracting Plan:
           All offerors except small businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with the Small Business
           Subcontracting Plan, FAR 52.219-9, incorporated in this solicitation for any task orders that are estimated to be above $550,000.
           The plan will only be required when a Request for Task Order Proposal is issued that is estimated to be above $550,000 and does not
           need to be submitted as part of this proposal.  A copy of a model subcontracting plan is available at
           http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/read/SampleSubcontractingPlan.doc.  If the model plan is not used, all elements outlined must be addressed
           in the offeror’s format.  If the offeror is not a small business and fails to submit a subcontracting plan when requested by a
           specific Request for Task Order proposal, the offeror will be considered nonresponsive and their proposal will be returned without
           further consideration.

           This provision does not apply to small business concerns.  This provision does apply to all other offerors, including large business
           concerns, colleges, universities and non-profit organizations.


            The term “subcontract” means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal
           Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract
           or subcontract.  This includes, but is not limited to, agreements/ purchase orders for supplies and services such as equipment
           purchase, copying services, and travel services.

            The offeror understands that:

              a. No task order above the threshold will be awarded unless and until an acceptable plan is negotiated with the Contracting
                 Officer. The plan will be incorporated in to the task order.

              b. An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting officer, provide the maximum practicable opportunity for small
                 business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to
                 participate in the performance of the task order.

              c. If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the
                 contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror,
                 the offeror shall be ineligible for award.  The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for
                 determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the
                 plan within the time limits prescribed.

              d. Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the
                 Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.

              e. It is the offeror’s responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to small business concerns and
                 small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned small
                 business concerns, and that each such aspect of the offeror’s plan will be judged independent of the other.

              f. The offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions
                 thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer.  Subcontractors will also submit these reports to the Government
                 Contracting Officer or as otherwise directed, with a copy to the prime Contractor’s designated small and disadvantaged business
                 liaison.


              g. For this particular acquisition, the AHRQ recommended goal (as a percentage of total contract value for the base period) is 20%
                 for Small Businesses,  which shall include at least 5.5% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base
                 period) for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, at least 5% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base
                 period) for Women-Owned Small Businesses, and at least 3% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base
                 period) for HUBZone Small Businesses and at least 3% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base period)
                 for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  These goals represent AHRQ’s expectations of the minimum level for subcontracting with
                 small business at the prime contract level.  Any goal stated less than the AHRQ recommended goal shall be justified and is
                 subject to negotiation.



L.14  SELECTION OF OFFERORS


      a.    The acceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee.  The
      committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation criteria of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written
      critiques.  The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror.


      b.    The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a limited cost review, management analysis, etc.


      c.    Past performance of the technically acceptable offerors will be evaluated by AHRQ staff.

      d.    The Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan will be evaluated by AHRQ staff.

      e.    A competitive range will be determined.  The competitive range will consist of those offers which are highly rated, based upon the
      technical, past performance, business, and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan evaluation.  Written discussions will be
      conducted with all offerors in the competitive range, if necessary.    A cost analysis will be performed by AHRQ’s Cost Analyst.  All
      aspects of the proposals are subject to discussions, including cost, technical approach, past performance, and contractual terms and
      conditions. Final Proposal Revisions may be requested with the reservation of the right to conduct limited negotiations after submission of
      Final Proposal Revisions.


      f.    A final best-value analysis will be performed taking into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, cost analysis, past
      performance, and ability to complete the work within the Government’s required schedule.  The Government reserves the right to make an
      award to the best advantage of the Government, technical merit, cost, past performance, and other factors considered.


      g.    The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP.

                                                     SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD





SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against four factors.  The four factors are: scientific
technical merit, past performance, small disadvantaged business participation plan and cost.  The scientific technical merit of the proposals
will receive paramount consideration for this acquisition.

                                                       THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO
                                                         MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION

All proposals will be reviewed in accordance with the governing regulations and AHRQ policies and procedures.  The technical proposal and past
performance will be evaluated in terms of the offeror’s responses to each of the evaluation factors.  The proposal will be evaluated on the
likelihood of meeting the Government’s requirements. The evaluation will be based on the technical and administrative capabilities in relation
to the needs of the program and anticipated tasks. The Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government.

The evaluation factors and assigned weights which will be used in the overall review of the offeror’s proposal are outlined below.  Separate
evaluation factors and weights are associated with each of the four separate Domains.  See the attachment for Domain Proposal Specifications
which lists the evaluation factors and weights for each Domain.  The technical proposal shall consist of the responses to the evaluation
criteria for the specific Domain for which the offeror is submitting a proposal.  The offeror should show that the objectives stated in the
proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.  The criteria will be used to evaluate the proposal and will be
weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all proposals submitted.  Factors facilitating the evaluation of each criteria
below are referenced in the corresponding criteria found in Section L of this solicitation:

TECHNICAL PROPOSAL EVALUATION…………………………………..…….100 points


PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  …….25 points

      (TO BE RATED ONLY AFTER A DETERMINATION OF TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY OF THE OFFEROR’S PROPOSAL, BASED ON THE ABOVE TECHNICAL EVALUATION
      CRITERIA)

      The offeror’s past performance will be evaluated after completion of the technical evaluation.  Only those offerors determined to be
      technically acceptable will be evaluated.  Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar
      products or services.  Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against
      which offeror’s relative rankings will be compared.


      Attached to this solicitation is a questionnaire which is to be copied and provided to customers for current and recently completed (within
      the past year) projects for work related to this requirement.  Please provide this questionnaire to your customers to complete and return
      to AHRQ no later than February 19, 2009.  Questionnaires received after that date will not be evaluated.  Offerors should also send this
      questionnaire to proposed major subcontractors so that they may also have their clients submit completed questionnaire to AHRQ for
      evaluation.

      The Government reserves the right to evaluate relevant past performance information not specifically provided by the offeror.


      Assessment of the offeror’s past performance for AHRQ, as well as other agencies and organizations, will be one means of evaluating the
      credibility of the offeror’s proposal and relative capability to meet performance requirements.  The past performance evaluation will be
      conducting using information gathered from questionnaires and information received from the offeror’s previous and current clients.
      Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective based on the consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  Information
      utilized will be obtained from the questionnaires received and from the references listed in the offeror’s proposal, other clients known to
      AHRQ and others who may have useful and relevant information.  Past performance will also be considered regarding subcontractors and key
      personnel.

      The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror’s
      likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by the offeror’s record of past performance.

      If the offeror or the proposed employees for the offeror, do not have a past performance history relative to this acquisition, or past
      performance not relative to this acquisition,  the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor.  A neutral rating
      will be determined.

      In evaluating past performance the Government, will consider the offeror’s effectiveness in quality of products or services; timeliness of
      performance; cost control; business practices; customer satisfaction, and key personnel past performance.


      NOTICE: Past Performance questionnaires are to be provided to the contracting office NO LATER than the closing date and time of this
      solicitation.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to ensure that these documents are forwarded to the contracting office.




















SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLAN EVALUATION…5 Points

      (TO BE RATED ONLY AFTER A DETERMINATION OF TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY OF THE OFFEROR’S PROPOSAL, BASED ON THE ABOVE TECHNICAL EVALUATION
      CRITERIA)

The evaluation will be based on information obtained from the Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan provided by the offeror, the
realism of the proposal, other relevant information from named SDB concerns, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems
encountered in SDB participation.

Evaluation of the SDB Participation Plan will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It
will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated
a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform as the prime contractor.

The assessment of the offeror’s SDB Participation Plan will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability and commitment of the
offeror and the other competitors.  Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of participation with SDB concerns may receive more points and a
more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable, even though both may have acceptable technical proposals.

SDB participation will be scored with offerors receiving points from 0 to 5, with t being the most favorable.

    A. Background Information


   The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting written
   proposals for master task order contracts to support the Agency’s Health IT portfolio by maintaining, serving as, and supporting the AHRQ
   National Resource Center for Health Information Technology (NRC) and its associated activities.


   In 2004, AHRQ established a single external NRC and a web site (healthit.ahrq.gov) to support its efforts to advance the goals of the HHS and
   AHRQ for transforming health care through the best and most effective use of health IT.  The NRC supports the AHRQ health IT program by
   serving as a central national source of information and assistance to help the nation embrace the power and efficiency of health information
   technology.


   In 2006, in recognition of the broader usefulness of the resources available on the NRC-supported website and the demand from the field for
   research findings and best practices, AHRQ made the NRC website publicly available. In addition to supporting this web presence, under
   direction from AHRQ, the NRC continues to provide direct technical assistance and consulting services to the Agency’s grantees, synthesizes
   information from literature and grantees to develop tools and information resources and, in collaboration with the AHRQ Office of
   Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT), plans and executes marketing activities to effectively disseminate the program’s findings and
   activities.  The NRC provides support to the Agency in designing and maintaining the public face of the AHRQ health IT program.  Over the past
   four years, under the direction of AHRQ, the NRC has amassed a health IT resource library of nearly 10,000 documents, tools, presentations and
   other resources and maintained a website with nearly 175,000 unique visitors downloading over 150,000 resources from the site in FY 2008.
   The website is designed to meet AHRQ’s goals of supporting the continuum of health care settings, clinicians, systems, and consumers – large
   and small, urban, rural and frontier.




   In addition, the NRC under direction from AHRQ serves as the link between the health care community at large and the researchers and experts
   who are on the front lines of health IT. As the central repository for lessons learned from AHRQ's Health IT initiative, the website and NRC
   staff encourage effective use of health IT by disseminating the latest tools, best practices, and research results. By providing direct
   technical assistance to AHRQ's health IT projects and supporting effective dissemination of lessons learned, the NRC is supporting AHRQ in
   maximizing the benefit of the Agency's investment in health IT.


   In addition to supporting AHRQ grantees, under direction of AHRQ staff, the NRC supports other federal partners’ health IIT program
   initiatives with a variety of services. For example, the Health Services Research Administration (HRSA) is partnering with AHRQ to leverage
   the NRC, its web architecture, and technical assistance resources to support its grantees.  Services provided by the NRC include technical
   assistance and consultative support, serving as a repository for best practice assimilation and diffusion; helping develop, maintain and
   export executable knowledge for clinicians and patients; offering expert health IT support for providers and communities; facilitating
   communication and sharing of ideas among grantees; performing and sponsoring educational activities;  and developing and disseminating tools
   to help providers and organizations utilize health IT to improve patient safety and quality of care in their communities.


   Through the NRC, the AHRQ Health IT program gains feedback on its priorities and supports development of knowledge resources to advance the
   field of health IT from experts in the field, coordinates statewide and regional health IT data interoperability demonstration projects, and
   establishes various communities of practice, workgroups, expert panels, and other collaborative efforts inside and outside of the government.


   The NRC under direction from AHRQ also facilitates collaboration with other federal, state, and private-efforts projects involved in health
   IT.  The AHRQ Health IT Program envisions that the next phase of activities for the NRC will focus on driving use and satisfaction of the NRC
   web presence and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of developing, synthesizing, and disseminating information for the program’s
   diverse stakeholders, including researchers, implementers and decision-makers.




    B. .AHRQ’s Health IT Initiative

    Established in 2004, the mission of the AHRQ Health IT Program purpose is to develop and disseminate evidence about how health information
   technology can be used to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  The program advances
   health IT research by creating, synthesizing and disseminating knowledge.  Health care providers, payers, and regulators use the knowledge our
   research generates to directly improve the quality and safety of health care.  The program’s three strategic focus areas include:  (1) Health
   IT to improve health care decision-making; (2) Health IT to support patient-centered care; and (3) Health IT to improve the quality and safety
   of medication management.


   To address this mission, AHRQ has invested over $260 million in contracts and grants and collaborative agreements  to over 150 communities,
   hospitals, providers, and health care systems  These projects constitute a real-world laboratory for examining health IT at work, and its role
   in improving the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of healthcare.


   Some key program activities to date include:
      ➢ Establishing and growing a National Resource Center for  Health  IT  (www.healthit.ahrq.gov)  with  funding  totaling  $24M  to  provide
        technical assistance and other services to program grantees, to synthesize emerging lessons, best practices, and research findings,  and
        to develop and disseminate tools and other information resources on the public website.
      ➢ Awarding over 100 grants and collaborative agreements totaling over $130 million to promote access to health  IT  by  helping  primarily
        small and rural communities, hospitals, providers, and health care systems plan, implement, and demonstrate the value of health IT.
      ➢ Awarding “State and Regional Demonstrations in Health Information Technology” contracts totaling $30 million to six  states  to  develop

   Through the issuance of task orders, AHRQ expects to award approximately $25 million, contingent on available funds, over the course of the
   one year base and four option year periods, with the potential of $50 million if the program expands and gains federal partners.  The ceiling
   for this series of master task order contracts has been set at $75 million.


A discussion of the roles and representative work requirements of each of the four Domains is provided as follows.

   Domain I.
   SUPPORT FOR HEALTH IT PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, GUIDANCE, ASSESSMENT & PLANNING




      By taking a Master Task Order approach with multiple domains, AHRQ seeks to recruit contractors with “best of breed” expertise in each of
      the four domain areas.  AHRQ also recognizes that this approach will require particular attention to coordination, tracking, and planning
      across domains.

Section III: Americans with Disabilities Act - Section 508 Checklist
This checklist can be used to review each Web page on public Web sites, Extranets, or Intranets for compliance with Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act. A review can be conducted in anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the complexity of the page, and the review process
will go faster for successive pages. It is designed to help you do a section-by-section analysis and validate the standards for Web-based
resources required by the Access Board: http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm.

Note: Documentation which supports compliance with all Section 508 checkpoints must be provided prior to production deployment (Test Reports,
etc.).

Tips for Testing

Automated validation methods are generally rapid and convenient but cannot identify all accessibility issues. Human review can help ensure
clarity of language and ease of navigation.

Use the following method for validating your Web pages:

1. Review your code using HTML 4.01 coding practices. HTML 4.01 code can be checked and validated at the W3C HTML Validation site
(http://validator.w3.org/). This site does not check your code or Web page for accessibility.

2. Use an assistive technology device to determine whether information can be interpreted correctly on the Web page.   

Screen Readers:

  • IBM Home Reader 3.0 (http://www.ibm.com)
  • JAWS for Windows (http://www.freedomscientific.com/)
  • Window-Eyes (http://www.GWmicro.com/)


3. Use W3C's CSS Validation Service (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for validating your style sheets. This validates code only, not
accessibility.


4. Test the Web pages with the keyboard only; rather than an event-driven device (mouse, etc).

5. Test the Web pages with sounds, graphics, and style sheets turned off.

APPENDIX B TO ATTACHMENT 5.  HHS IT Systems Security and Privacy Information
                                         Steps for Including Security and Privacy in your System/Program

I am initiating the development of a new system or program, and want ensure compliance with security and privacy regulations.  What steps do I
need to take to ensure that information security and privacy requirements are met and that I am fulfilling my responsibilities as a system owner
and/or project officer?

Project Initiation
 ✓ Review the role based training course Information Security for Managers to understand your information security and privacy
   responsibilities.  Additional information may also be found in the HHS Contractor Oversight Guide.

 ✓ Identify applicable laws, policies and standards that will drive the information security and privacy requirements for the system.  The
   Secure One HHS web site is a good starting point.

 ✓ Review National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information
   System Development Life Cycle to understand where and how security and privacy fit into the overall life cycle of the system/program.  You may
   also check SP 800-64 Rev. 2 DRAFT Security Considerations in the System Development Life Cycle, which is an undated version currently in the
   comments phase of its lifecycle.

 ✓ Categorize the system based on the type(s) of information it is going to store, process, transmit or share, and determine the corresponding
   security requirements.  It is required that you use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 Standards for Security Categorization
   of Federal Information and Information Systems and FIPS 200 Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems
   processes to complete this activity.

 ✓ Determine if the system should be categorized as a major investment.  According to OMB, a major investment means a system or acquisition
   requiring special management attention because of its importance to the mission or function of the agency, a component of the agency or
   another organization; is for financial management and obligates more than $500,000 annually; has significant program or policy implications;
   has high executive visibility; has high development, operating or maintenance cost; is funded through other than direct appropriations; or is
   defined as major by the agency’s capital planning and investment control process.

 ✓ Contact the AHRQ Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or a member of the AHRQ Information Security and Privacy Program to review the
   system security and investment categorizations and discuss the additional security and privacy requirements that must be met.

      o Eric Colombel, AHRQ CISO:  eric.colombel@ahrq.hhs.gov or 301-427-1750

      o AHRQ Information Security and Privacy Program:  SecureAHRQ@ahrq.hhs.gov

 ✓ If the system requires moderate to high security scrutiny, continue down the checklist.  If the system requires a lower security scrutiny,
   skip to the checklist designated accordingly.

                                                      Checklist for Moderate to High Systems

I have a system that requires additional security and privacy scrutiny.  How do I make sure that I am including the security and privacy that I
have to?
Requirements Analysis
 ✓ Review the contract language before the Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued to ensure that security and privacy requirements are properly
   built into the contract language.

 ✓ Ensure that you understand the HHS FDCC standards and HHS Minimum Security Configuration Standards and their applicability to your
   system/program. These standards must be incorporated into the acquisition and development of the system, where applicable.

 ✓ Complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and determine if a System of Records Notice (SORN) must be created.  The HHS Privacy Impact
   Assessment (PIA) Guide describes the requirements of the PIA.  Tim Erny, the AHRQ Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) or the AHRQ Information
   Security and Privacy Program can aid in the SORN determination and provide additional privacy guidance.

      o Tim Erny, AHRQ CISO:  tim.erny@ahrq.hhs.gov or 301-427-1760

      o AHRQ Information Security and Privacy Program:  SecureAHRQ@ahrq.hhs.gov

 ✓ Identify security and privacy requirements.  NIST 800-53 Rev. 2, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems describes the
   controls necessary for systems, based on system categorization.  Also, refer to the AHRQ Organizationally-defined Security Controls for
   additional guidance on AHRQ-specific settings.

 ✓ Perform a preliminary risk assessment as described in NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.  Refer to
   the HHS Certification & Accreditation Checklist for additional information and a template.

 ✓ Perform an E-Authentication Risk Assessment in accordance with OMB Memorandum M-04-04 on E-Authentication Guidance to Federal Agencies and
   the HHS OpDiv E-Authentication Guidance memorandum.  Refer to the HHS E-Authentication Risk Assessment template as an example of a compliant
   format.

 ✓ Upon contract award, review the HHS Information Security Program Rules of Behavior, and ensure that all staff and contractors have also
   reviewed and signed the rules of behavior.

 ✓ Ensure that all staff and contractors have successfully completed the HHS Information Systems Security Awareness training.  This is an
   annual requirement for all AHRQ staff and contractors.

 ✓ Review and employ the HHS Certification & Accreditation Checklist for use while developing the system.  A system cannot be used, or become
   operational, until a C&A has been completed, validating that adequate security controls have been built into the system.  An additional
   resource outlining the standards for C&A is NIST 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information
   Systems.

Design
 ✓ Identify and design the required security and privacy controls.  NIST 800-53 Rev. 2, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information
   Systems describes the controls necessary for systems, based on system categorization.  Also, refer to the AHRQ Organizationally-defined
   Security Controls for additional guidance on AHRQ-specific settings.

 ✓ Employ the HHS Certification & Accreditation Checklist to kick-off formal C&A documentation preparation.  Specifically, initiate the System
   Security Plan (SSP).  Document the details of the system and the planned controls in the SSP.  See NIST SP 800-18, Rev.1, Guide for Developing
   Security Plans for Federal Information Systems for guidance on the SSP and a suggested template.  An additional resource outlining the
   standards for C&A is NIST 800-37, Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.

Development
 ✓ Implement the required security and privacy controls.  NIST 800-53 Rev. 2, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems
   describes the controls necessary for systems, based on system categorization.  Also, refer to the AHRQ Organizationally-defined Security
   Controls for additional guidance on AHRQ-specific settings.

 ✓ Further define the details of the system and the associated controls in the System Security Plan (SSP).  See NIST SP 800-18, Rev.1, Guide
   for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems for guidance on the SSP and a suggested template.

 ✓ Develop a Contingency Plan using NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems as a guide to document the
   procedures for recovering the system should it become inoperable.  Refer to the HHS Certification & Accreditation Checklist for additional
   information and a template.

Testing
 ✓ Perform a System Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) to determine if the system security controls have been properly implemented.  This test
   and evaluation must be performed by an independent third party that was not involved in the system design/implementation or the creation of
   the C&A package.  NIST SP 800-53A, DRAFT Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and the HHS Security Test
   and Evaluation Guide are two resources to consult for conducting ST&E.

 ✓ Finalize the risk assessment as described in NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems.  Refer to the HHS
   Certification & Accreditation Checklist for additional information and a template.

 ✓ Develop Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to track the system weaknesses or vulnerabilities identified during the C&A process.  All
   system weaknesses must also be associated with remediation activities, resources, and deadlines for completion. The HHS Plan of Action and
   Milestones (POA&M) Guide provides guidance on the documentation, tracking and reporting of POA&M weaknesses.

 ✓ Finalize the system C&A package for submission to the AHRQ Certification Agent (CA) for review and the granting of a security certification.
    The CA assesses the entire system and its C&A package to ensure the appropriate security controls are documented, implemented and operating
   as intended.  The CA for AHRQ is Eric Colombel.

      o Eric Colombel, AHRQ CA:  eric.colombel@ahrq.hhs.gov or 301-427-1750

 ✓ Incorporate CA feedback into the C&A package and make any necessary revisions to the system.

 ✓ Transmit the C&A package to the AHRQ Authorizing Official (AO) for the formal permission to operate the system and assumption of risk
   associated with the operation of the system.  The AHRQ AO is Mark Handelman.

      o Mark Handelman, AHRQ AO:  mark.handelman@ahrq.hhs.gov or 301-427-1703

 ✓ Incorporate AO feedback into the C&A package.

 ✓ Receive and file the formal Authority to Operate (ATO) letter.  The DAA issues a written ATO, which must be in place before the system is
   allowed to become operational.



Operations/Maintenance
 ✓ Perform continuous monitoring and incident management activities throughout the operations/maintenance phase of the system.

      o Perform annually a system self-assessment and testing of the system’s contingency plan.  Refer to the HHS Certification & Accreditation
        Checklist for additional information and a template.

      o Monitor the system for unusual or malicious activity, and report any incidents that occur to the AHRQ CISO, Eric Colombel, or the AHRQ
        Information Security and Privacy Program immediately.

 ✓ Track and report all new and existing weaknesses in accordance with POA&M and HHS reporting standards as per the HHS Plan of Action and
   Milestones (POA&M) Guide.

 ✓ Perform system recertification as necessary (at least every three years or if a major change to the system occurs).  Refer to NIST 800-37,
   Guide for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.



Disposition
 ✓ Retire the system by ensuring that it is removed from the AHRQ system inventory. Contact Eric Colombel (eric.colombel@ahrq.hhs.gov or 301-
   427-1750), the AHRQ CISO, or the AHRQ Information Security and Privacy Program (SecureAHRQ@ahrq.hhs.gov) for assistance with these activities.



 ✓ Perform media sanitation, such that no data is left on the system being disposed of or retired, to include data bases, hard drives,
   removable media, and back-up storage sources.  Review National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-64,
   Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle to understand the disposition phase of the SDLC.  You may also check

   accordance with HHS PIA guidance.  Periodic reviews shall be conducted to determine if a major change to the system has occurred, and if a PIA
   update is subsequently required.  If it is determined that an update is necessary, the Contractor shall make the necessary changes to the PIA.


   The Contractor shall abide by all requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and FAR Clause 52-239-1.  Pursuant to those requirements, the
   Contractor shall create and publish a System of Records Notice (SORN) in the Federal Register when required and shall publish an updated SORN
   following a major change to the system, as directed by OMB Memorandum (M) 03-22, OMB Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-
   Government Act of 2002, or subsequent replacement guidance.


6. System accreditation.  The Contractor shall certify and accredit all systems in conformance with the standards set forth by the Federal
   Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37, Guide
   for the Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems, prior to the system becoming operational.  This activity
   shall be performed in conjunction with the initial development of the system, updated when a major change occurs to the system, and renewed no
   less than every three years.  All system certification and accreditation (C&A) packages shall be compliant with all Public Law (PL)-107-347,
   OMB mandates, FIPS, and additional applicable NIST guidance.  This guidance includes, but is not limited to FIPS 199, FIPS 200, NIST SP 800-
   18, NIST SP 800-30, NIST SP 800-37, NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-53A, and NIST SP 800-60.  All NIST and FIPS documentation can be found at the
   NIST website.

   HHS has created a C&A checklist to facilitate compliance with the OMB-mandated C&A process.  The HHS C&A Checklist will be provided upon
   contract initiation.  Prior to becoming operational, all systems must receive a signed Authorization to Operate (ATO) issued by the agency
   Designated Authorization Authority (DAA).  No system will be permitted into the production environment without a valid, signed ATO.


7. Annual requirements.  The Contractor shall be responsible for meeting ongoing information security and privacy system requirements.  These
   include, but are not limited to, performing annual system testing, completing an annual system self-assessment, and supporting quarterly and
   annual AHRQ FISMA reporting.  Additionally, AHRQ reserves the right to test or review the system security and privacy controls at any time.


8. Security and privacy training.  All Contractors shall receive general awareness training and role-based training, commensurate with the
   responsibilities required to perform the work articulated in the terms and conditions of the Contract.


   The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring each contractor employee has completed the AHRQ Security Awareness Training as required by
   the agency prior to performing any contract work or accessing any system, and on an annual basis thereafter, throughout the period of
   performance of the contract.  The Contractor shall maintain a list of all individuals who have completed this training and shall submit this
   list to the Project Officer upon request.  As a part of this training, the Contractor shall ensure that all staff read, agree to, and sign the
   HHS Rules of Behavior.


   The Contractor shall ensure that all contractors with significant security responsibilities, as defined by HHS, receive commensurate role-
   based training.  As stated in the Secure One HHS Memorandum, Role-Based Training (RBT) of Personnel with Significant Security
   Responsibilities, significant security responsibilities are defined as the responsibilities associated with a given role or position, which,
   upon execution, could have the potential to adversely impact the security posture of one or more HHS systems.[3]  The Contractor shall
   maintain a list of all individuals that possess significant security responsibilities and the subsequent role-based training courses
   completed, and shall submit this list to the Project Officer upon request.

9. Electronic communication.  All Contractor staff that have access to and use of HHS electronic mail (e-mail) must identify themselves as
   contractors on all outgoing e-mail messages, including those sent in reply or forwarded to another user.  The Contractor shall ensure all
   contractor staff embed an e-mail signature ("AutoSignature") or an electronic business card ("V-card") within each electronic correspondence
   to automatically display "Contractor" in the signature.


10. Clearances.  The Contractor shall ensure all staff have the required level of security clearance commensurate with the sensitivity of the
   information being stored, processed, transmitted or otherwise handled by the System or required to perform the work stipulated by the
   contract.  At the minimum, all Contractor staff shall be subjected to a Public Trust background check and be granted a Public Trust clearance
   before access to the System or other HHS resources is granted.


11. Non-Disclosure.  The Contractor shall not release, publish, or disclose agency information to unauthorized personnel, and shall protect such
   information in accordance with the provisions of the following laws and any other pertinent laws and regulations governing the confidentiality
   of sensitive information:


                  -18 U.S.C. 641 (Criminal Code: Public Money, Property or Records)
                  -18 U.S.C. 1905 (Criminal Code: Disclosure of Confidential Information)
                  - PL 96-511 (Paperwork Reduction Act)

   The Contractor shall ensure that each contractor employee who may have access to agency information under this contract shall complete and
   sign the Commitment to Protect Non-Public Information - Contractor Agreement (Non-Disclosure Agreement).  A copy of each signed and witnessed
   Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be submitted to the Project Officer prior to performing any work under the contract.


12. Mobile device encryption.  The Contractor shall: (a) encrypt all laptop computers, mobile devices and portable media which store or process,
   or may store or process, sensitive information using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption technology; (b) verify that encryption products have been
   validated under the Cryptographic Module Validation Program to confirm compliance with FIPS 140-2; (c) establish key recovery mechanisms to
   ensure the ability to decrypt and recover sensitive information by authorized personnel; and (d) generate and manage encryption keys securely
   to prevent unauthorized decryption of information.  For more information, reference the HHS Encryption Standard for Mobile Devices and
   Portable Media.

13. Desktop Encryption.  The Contractor shall: (a) encrypt all desktop computers which store or process, or may store or process, sensitive
   information using FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption technology; (b) verify that encryption products have been validated under the Cryptographic
   Module Validation Program to confirm compliance with FIPS 140-2; (c) establish key recovery mechanisms to ensure the ability to decrypt and
   recover sensitive information by authorized personnel; and (d) generate and manage encryption keys securely to prevent unauthorized decryption
   of information.  In the case that appropriate compensating controls are implemented to protect sensitive desktop computers, the requirement
   for encryption may be waived with approval from the AHRQ Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).  For more information, reference the HHS
   Encryption Standard for Mobile Devices and Portable Media.


14. Minimum security configurations. The Contractor shall certify applications are fully functional, operate as intended, and comply with the
   HHS Minimum Security Configurations for Operating Systems (currently HHS has minimum configuration standards for Windows 2000 Server, Windows
   2000 Professional, Windows 2003 Server, Windows NT, Windows XP, Solaris, HP-UX, Redhat Linux, Oracle, and Cisco IOS).  These standard security
   configurations shall be provided to the Contractor at the time of contract initiation and upon completion of the required Non-Disclosure
   Agreements.  Additionally, the Contractor shall adhere to these configurations when developing the system.  As standard configurations may
   change frequently, the Contractor must ensure applications remain compliant with the most recent set of security configurations.


   Additionally, for desktops within the system boundary, the Contractor shall comply with the configurations defined in the HHS Federal Desktop
   Core Configuration (FDCC) standards, which were designed to meet the requirements mandated by OMB.  The FDCC standards will be provided upon
   contract initiation.  The installation, operation, maintenance, update, and/or patching of software shall not alter the approved HHS Minimum
   Security Configurations or the HHS FDCC standards.  Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without
   elevated system administration privileges.  Exceptions to the HHS requirements must be documented, accompanied by compensating controls, and
   approved by the HHS CISO and the AHRQ CISO in advance of implementation.


15. Maintenance.  The Contractor shall ensure that the system, once operational, is properly maintained and monitored, to include immediate
   response to critical security patches, routine maintenance windows to allow for system updates, and compliance with a defined configuration
   management process.  All patches and system updates shall be properly tested in a development environment before being implemented in the
   production environment.

AHRQ Application and System Development Requirements

AHRQ has implemented a Distributed Systems Engineering Lab (DSEL) to support all internal development efforts and provide the facility for
housing the software and documentation for all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted.

AHRQ uses a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework which is consistent with the HHS Enterprise Lifecycle Framework (EPLC).  This
framework is the basis for implementation of the DSEL, conduct of development projects and the Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Capability
Maturity Model (CMM) based processes that support its implementation. The SDLC framework provides a disciplined approach which employs the
following traditional project phases:

    • Concept
    • Initiation
    • Planning
    • Requirements Analysis
    • Design
    • Development
    • Testing
    • Implementation / Deployment
    • Operations and Maintenance
    • Retirement

The AHRQ SDLC framework is closely aligned with the disciplines defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  The IBM Rational Suite of tools
has been adopted by the Agency to provide a standard IT development environment for AHRQ sponsored systems and application development projects.
  The AHRQ SDLC framework has been enhanced through the use of tailored processes and artifacts based on the RUP methodology.  The documentation
deliverables required for all Information Technology (IT) projects are based on specific RUP artifacts identified by AHRQ.  The Rational
ClearCase libraries housed within the DSEL provide the repository for housing software and documentation artifacts related to all AHRQ sponsored
systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted.

Contractors are not required to follow the RUP development methodology or use the Rational Suite of tools; however, the Contractor’s SDLC must
be capable of producing AHRQ required system deliverables containing the required content as described further in the following section.  It is
required that the Contractor use the lifecycle phases defined in the AHRQ SDLC framework and obtain PO approval before moving from one phase to
another.
This approval process corresponds to the stage gates in the HHS EPLC model. The contractor must also conform to AHRQ Configuration Management
(CM) and change control standards which require appropriate controls for managing software and documentation baselines, changes to software
artifacts using an appropriate IDE or version management tool, document change requests and obtaining approval through a formal change control
process that requires Project Officer (PO) and possible AHRQ IT approval prior to implementation.

The following table identifies the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.

System Documentation

The Contractor will provide to the Agency system documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup/recovery, and other
information technology infrastructure and components and solutions needed to support this project.  The documentation is to be delivered to the
Project Officer for review and approval for each release.  This documentation will be provided according to the content standards specified by
AHRQ and will be maintained in the Agency’s Rational ClearCase Repository as a unique project library created and maintained by the AHRQ CM
Manager.  All documentation will be baselined with each system release. In addition, the source code for each production release will be
delivered and stored in the same project library as the documentation artifacts. The contractor will be required to update these baselined
artifacts for each production release of the system.  Sample documents and templates for the required documentation artifacts are available as
guidance.  The following documents as mentioned in Table 1.1, “Documentation Deliverables”, are required by AHRQ.

Project Initiation Document

The Project Initiation Document (PID) is intended to be a statement of purpose and scope for initiating a given project and a guide to manage
expectations in both process and deliverables throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  The PID defines the business case for the
project by defining the purpose, the milestones, resources, objectives, costs, risks including mitigation strategies, and the artifacts and IT
technologies (architecture) utilized and produced for, and during, the project. The PID serves as the formal funding commitment document
approved by the COTR and Stakeholders.  Additionally, the PID must be approved by AHRQ IT management, and in some cases, the AHRQ Information
Technology Review Board (ITRB) for technical viability, adherence to Agency Enterprise Architecture (EA); technical standards and formal Project
Management requirements as derived from Departmental standards and accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of
Knowledge (PMBOK) standards.  In the case of external development contracts, the PID can be satisfied by the formal proposal submitted by the
vendor and accepted by AHRQ.


Project Work Plan

The System Project Plan or Project Work Plan (PWP) provides a method to assign and track the project resources, hours and specific deliverables.
This plan provides the detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource loading that can be used to identify project costs and is intended
for the project manager to track the schedule and cost of a project, including development of Earned Value Management (EVM) measures. The PWP is
delineated by the phases of the project which include Project Initiation, Generation of the PWP Schedule, Requirements Gathering, System Design,
System Development, System Testing including User Acceptance, System Deployment and System Support and production of project deliverables which
require COTR or Stakeholder acceptance and signoff to continue project tasks identified in the PWP.

System Requirements Document

The System Requirements Document (SRD) contains the system requirements, use cases and supplementary specifications that provide the basis for
design and development of the system.  The following information is provided for each requirement identified in the document:

    • Requirement ID, Name and Title
    • Requirement Description
    • Software Release Version
    • Use Case Model
    • Use Case Specifications
    • Supplementary Specifications

A text-based Functional Requirements Document may be provided instead of a Use Case Model, Use Case Specifications, and Supplementary
Specifications.


Requirements Traceability Matrix


The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) associates requirements with the work products that satisfy them.  This matrix is created at the
beginning of a project’s lifecycle to trace the requirements from identification through testing.  The project elements are traced as they
relate to other project elements, especially those related to requirements. 

The purpose of establishing traceability is to help understand the sources of requirements, manage the scope of the project, manage changes to
requirements; assess the project impact of a change in a requirement; and verify that all requirements of the system are fulfilled by the
implementation.

The following values are required for the traceability matrix:

    • Requirement ID and Title;
    • The version of the system in which the requirement will be implemented;
    • The Use Case to which the requirement can be traced;
    • The version of the design document in which the requirement is implemented;
    • The ID of the test script in which the requirement is tested;
    • The version number of the source code in which the requirement is implemented.



The figure below shows a sample of the data traced through a project’s life cycle.

                                                                      [pic]

System Design Document

The System Design Document (SDD) details the design and implementation of all custom software features of the system. The design descriptions
must include use cases that detail the interaction which occurs between a user and the system.

The document describes the general nature of the system, and describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its
decomposition into subsystems and packages.  For each significant package, a section of the document should detail its decomposition into
classes and class utilities.  Architecturally significant classes should be introduced and a description of their responsibilities should
accompany the introduction.  Any significant relationships, operations, and attributes should be detailed in this document.

The document should be organized by use case, so that it provides traceability back to the initial requirements. The document must also contain
a description of the database model and data elements used to support the application. This data can be referenced to an appropriately
maintained Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and data definitions which conform to CM standards and are appropriately maintained in the Rational
CM Libraries.
Test Plan



The purpose of the Test Plan is to define the approach for testing a particular application or system.  The Test Plan is a high level
description of the testing process which will be performed. The Test Plan outlines the types of testing to be performed, the requirements to be
tested, the test environment, testing tools, pass/fail criteria and a risk assessment. At a minimum the document should contain the following:

   A. Test Description
         • A general overview of the plan for testing the entire system.
         • Test objectives for all testing levels (e.g. module, unit).
         • Scope and guiding principles for the testing effort.
         • A policy for resolving conflicts that arise during the testing process.
   B. Acceptance Criteria
         • The criteria agreed upon with the customer for acceptance of the software.
         •
   C. Approach
         • How each major group of software features will be adequately tested.
         • Major testing activities, techniques, and testing tools.
         • Test Environment – Hardware, Network, Software and Test Database
   D. Tasks
         • The individual tasks that must be performed.
         • The individual or organization responsible for each task.
   E. Schedule, Resources & Milestones
Test Scripts



The Test Scripts define testing scenarios completed for an application.  Each scenario details the steps to be performed, expected results and
pass/fail criteria.  At a minimum the document should contain the following:



    • Test Script Identifier
    • Test Description
    • Test Objective
    • Test Environment/Setup including any required data such as Login credentials, etc.
    • Mapping to specific requirements and design elements contained in the SRD and SDD
    • Step sequences and actions
    • Expected Results
    • Pass/Fail Criteria
    • Actual Results
    • Comments




User Acceptance Test Report



The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report should include a summary of the testing environment (hardware, software, tools, participant list, etc.)
and procedures used to demonstrate and obtain stakeholder approval of the application or system prior to production deployment. The UAT Report
should contain a mapping to the SRD and SDD items included in the release as well as an exception list or identified change requests that were
generated as the result of testing.



User Guide



The User Guide is completed prior to production.  The User Guide is a “How To” manual which navigates the user in detail through the use of the
application.  This document usually contains system screen shots and provides step by step instructions for completing tasks and activities.  It
is written on a business level with the needs of the user in mind.  At a minimum the document should contain the following content.



    • Introduction
    • Summary of the application
    • Glossary (Definitions/Acronyms)
    • Procedures (Step-by Step instructions on how to use the system)
    • Troubleshooting tips
Operations Manual



The Operations Manual provides guidance and defines procedures related to the operational implementation of the system. At a minimum, the
document should contain the following:

    • System Overview
    • Statement of acceptable use of the system and information
    • Hardware and software descriptions
    • Interfaces with other Systems and Databases
    • Access and authentication requirements

    • Incident Reporting and Handling
    • System Startup and Recovery Procedures
    • Change Management Procedures

Version Description Document



The Version Description Document (VDD) identifies and describes the general release information, and inventory of software released (Bill of
Materials), for a specific application, including prototype iterations. The document should include the following sections listed below:

    • Introduction - Describes the objective of the document, defines the release identification and provides contact information.
    • General Release Information - Provide information about the specific release, including any interfaces and dependencies
    • Installation Instructions - Describes the steps required to install the software.
    • Version Description - Provides an inventory of List Objects and Module Types such as: class files, SQL Scripts, HTML files, DTD and XML
      files.
    • Recovery Instructions - Describe the steps required to reconstruct the release from the product baselines, established in the configuration
      management library.

Web Product and Web Site Development Guidelines
       
The following list highlights basic issues that need to be addressed when developing Web tools or sites under contract that will be publicly
available when launched to ensure deliverables are on target, in compliance with legal and policy requirements, and do not require expensive
rework to meet Federal and Department of Health and Human Services requirements for information resources.


Guidelines for Web-Based Products
 
Retrofitting Web-based products after the fact is highly undesirable because it adds time and costs to the process of making these products
publicly available. All products that are developed with the intent of being posted on the AHRQ Web site should meet the following minimum
requirements:
 
Titles of Products

Coordinate with your project officer on the titles of your products. They need to be concise and relevant to the purpose of the project, but
cannot include the name of the contractor or grantee as the performing organization as part of the title. Report titles should be no more than
10-words maximum and Web-based tools should be no more than 5-words maximum (make every word count—eliminate initial articles such as “The” or
“A” ). Titles need to be distinct enough to differentiate among similar sounding products.

Quality Control/Editorial Review

This involves checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting issues, general consistency, and style.  This should be done by the AHRQ
grantee or contractor prior to submission of the final product for posting on the AHRQ Web site. Federal resources follow the GPO Style Manual
which is available electronically at:
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility

As an agency of the Federal Government, AHRQ must ensure that anything that is posted on our Web site is in compliance with requirements for
information resources under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Also, federally funded resources need to be generally available to users in
multiple formats to ensure that we are not forcing a particular platform, operational system, or proprietary software package on users.
 
Intellectual Property Rights

Before we can post a product on the AHRQ Web site, we must have a written explanation of the following four questions:

    • Who retains the copyright?
    • Who has licenses for what purposes and uses?
    • What are the constraints imposed?
    • Who grants permission for further use or adoption?

Usability

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to
ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are designed to facilitate. A set of Research-Based Web Design and
Usability Guidelines that should be consulted are available at: http://www.usability.gov/guidelines/index.html

Beta testing prior to release is desirable, evaluating the product against usability heuristics. As feedback is received and products are
updated, the revisions will need to be designated by version number and date of release.
 
Privacy Act Protections

Web resources are subject to the Privacy Act and this can impact both the development of Web-based tools and the users of those tools.
Persistent cookies should not be programmed into the functionality of a Web-based tool, although session cookies are allowed. Registration for
use cannot be requested if this would involve collection of individual identifiers from the users. Although exemptions to both rules can be
sought, this involves a strong justification and several levels of review for approval through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS).
 
Guidelines for Web Sites
 
Web sites being supported through contracts are considered Federal information resources and as such are required to be in compliance with laws,
policies, and directives that affect such resources.

This includes content management and information categorization, including standard metadata, under the E-Gov Act requirements and Office of
Management and Budget issuances to Federal agencies on IT resources.

For recommendations and guidance on requirements and best practices, go to:
http://www.usa.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/best_practices.shtml

Clearance

Web resources require clearance by HHS--including justification against a set of criteria. Publications cleared for printing are cleared for Web
uploading at the same time. Web resources must comply with the numerous laws and directives that affect federally funded electronic information
resources. Web content loaded on a site by contractors must be appropriate and follow all laws and directives. AHRQ Offices and Centers must
coordinate initial review through AHRQ's Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) before launch, and OCKT will coordinate
departmental clearance.

Domain Names

All domain names for any Web resource funded in whole or in part by Federal funds must be registered as .gov through HHS with the General
Services Administration (GSA). Although other domains, such as .org, .net, .edu, .com may also be reserved by the Agency, the .gov domain must
be registered and that domain name will need to be indexed by USA.gov, the GSA portal to government-funded resources. The USA.gov link is then
required on the home page of the site. Coordinate with OCKT on domain name requests.

Editorial Review

All content for upload needs to be reviewed to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices and established style and conventions. As a
minimum, the copy needs to be production edited to ensure there are no typos and the GPO Style Manual is followed for punctuation, spelling, use
of numerals, abbreviations, etc. Do not use unexplained acronyms; they need to be spelled out on first reference in any document or file. There
should not be anything marked DRAFT on a public site. Once the materials are uploaded, they are published and considered in the "public domain."
Do not use placeholders for content that does not exist. Government funded sites should not have anything designated "under construction." A
process needs to be established for regular review of content and updating. Additional materials need to undergo editorial review and be
approved before uploading. The GPO Style Guide is available electronically as a reference at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html

Accessibility

Under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal agencies have an obligation to provide equal access for the disabled to their information and services.
Requirements are specified in section 504 for individual accommodation and more recently in section 508 for electronic and information
technology, which includes Web sites and multimedia products. Equivalent alternatives are required for auditory and visual information, such as
providing alternative descriptive text for images for the blind and providing captions for audio-video files for the deaf. Written transcripts
are required for all streaming audio. PDF files can be offered in conjunction with accessible files, such at HTML versions, but avoid uploading
PDF-only versions of documents unless they are fully accessible PDF formats. OCKT has software used to evaluate Web sites and can provide a
report on any accessibility violations that would need to be addressed before launch. Specific requirements are available at:
http://www.section508.gov

Privacy

A privacy policy notice must be prominently displayed, and the Web site host has to follow it. A machine-readable format (P3P) of the privacy
policy notice must also be uploaded to the site. A Privacy Impact Assessment is conducted to determine what kind of personal information is
contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected.  Sites are periodically audited to ensure
that they observe their stated privacy policy. A Privacy Act System notice may need to be prepared and published for users to register on a site
if the registrations represent a group of records, under the control of the Agency (or a contractor), that can be retrieved by personal
identifier. This notice must go through several levels of review--including the Office of General Counsel--and be published in the Federal
Register. Persistent cookies cannot be used on Federal sites unless the Secretary of HHS grants an exemption, and this involves a strong
justification and review process.

Web Site Mailbox

Every Web site must provide full contact information for the sponsor and have a Contact Us link for submission of comments or questions as a
customer feedback mechanism. Web site e-mail is subject to the same privacy and records management issues that affect the overall Web site as
well as departmental standards for handling inquiries and customer feedback. Each Web site must provide relevant Frequently Asked Questions that
are included in the customer relationship management system used to handle AHRQ Web site inquiries.

Records Management

All content on the site and e-mail generated by the site must be archived electronically and handled according to records retention schedules
and disposition authorities as established with the National Archives and Record Administration. This requirement also affects Web site log
files and statistical reporting on Web site usage. For guidance on requirements, go to:
http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html


Information Collection Budget

If a Web site is used to collect information from users, such as for surveys, evaluations, or beta testing feedback, then the Office of
Management and Budget must first approve the burden hours for such an effort for this collection. A notice must be posted on the Web site at the
point of collection with the OMB approval number and a statement on the process of collection.

Intellectual Property

Copyright and trademark protections need to be observed on Web sites. Permissions for use must be granted for any copyrighted information
included and registered trademarks need to be reflected in copy. Any copyright or trademark constraints related to materials uploaded to a site
must be specified for users. Public domain does not extend outside the borders of the United States. Therefore, foreign countries must request
specific permission for use. Given the global nature of the Internet, citation as to source is a critical issue.

Linking

External links constitute an implied endorsement and create a business advantage for the linked sites. OMB requires Agencies to do a risk
assessment of external links, and potential links need to be assessed against the HHS and AHRQ linking policies and criteria. If a site deviates
from these policies, then the specific review and selection criteria must be justified and posted on the Web site for full disclosure. Outside
Web resources may link to Agency resources providing that the link is not displayed in any way that would imply an endorsement by the Agency of
a specific commercial product or service.

Electronic FOIA

The Agency is required by law to have an electronic FOIA reading room and to provide materials that can be requested under the Freedom of
Information Act in electronic form, if so requested. HHS requires that any Web resource funded by the Agency provide a link to the AHRQ Freedom
of Information Act page on the main AHRQ Web site.

Usability

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to
ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are supposed to facilitate. For best practices in initial development or
redesign of Web resources, go to: http://www.usability.gov

Web Sponsor Identity

AHRQ has uniform principles to identify AHRQ as the primary sponsor of AHRQ-related Web sites. These principles reflect HHS best practices for a
consistent look and feel of Web resources, reinforce credibility, and support HHS and Agency branding efforts. The four specific principles that
should be consistent across all AHRQ-funded Web sites are:
 
    • Web site URL name: The name of a Web site should always contain AHRQ in the URL. A Web resource should either be a folder on the main AHRQ
      Web site (www.ahrq.gov/chiri) or a third-level domain of the Web site (www.webmm.ahrq.gov).
    • Title of Web site project: AHRQ's name should be part of the formal title and appear at the beginning of the Web site's project name when
      referenced in print or promotional materials. For example: AHRQ's Web Morbidity and Mortality online journal.
    • HHS and AHRQ logos: The HHS and AHRQ logos should be featured prominently on the Web site and in materials that are used to market that Web
      site.
    • Web site home page format: The Web site home page should have common design and navigation elements with the HHS Portal and the AHRQ Web
      site so that all Web sites look as though they belong to the Department and AHRQ Web family. All AHRQ domain sites must include a standard
      banner and footer that are branded for Web resources. Technical specifications and templates for developers to consult when designing Web
      resources are provided by the AHRQ Web Manager.

Use Dark Text on Plain, High-Contrast Backgrounds

Standard:
HHS must use black (preferable) or other dark text on a white or off-white background when presenting text information—including headers,
captions, and prose text—on Web pages.

Rationale:
Research studies consistently show that dark text on a plain background elicits reliably faster scanning and reading performance than on a
medium-textured background. When compared to scanning or reading light text on a dark background, people read black text on a white background
up to thirty-two percent faster. In general, the greater the contrast between the text and background, the easier the information is to scan or
read.

Use Dark Text on Plain, High-Contrast Backgrounds (Continued)

Exemptions:
Background shades of color may be used in text boxes, panels, tabs, and other elements of a Web page.  There must be high contrast, however,
between the text (foreground) and the background.  You must select color combinations that can be discriminated by users with color
deficiencies/color blindness.  You may be exempt from this requirement in sites targeted to children, youth, and other groups with demonstrated
specific needs and requirements.  In using colored backgrounds, though, readability must be maintained, especially for individuals with low
vision, via contrast between text and background colors.

You may wish to use these resources:
 • Colour Contrast Check (Jonathan Snook, Snook.ca)
   This tool allows you to specify foreground and background colors to determine if they provide enough contrast.
 • Contrast Checker (Q42)

Font Size and Typeface

Standard:
HHS must use sans serif (such as Verdana or Arial) on Web pages. The selected font must be used consistently throughout the site. In general,
usability tests have shown that users perceive sans serif fonts to be more contemporary.

HHS must use Arial or Verdana font and the listed font size (or equivalent) for standard text and links on all Web pages.  Use the following
scale as a guide to determine size:

|If the Font Type Is…                 |Then You Must Use…                       |
|Arial                                |11 Point Font Size                       |
|Verdana                              |10 Point Font Size                       |

If you have specialized audiences, use the appropriate font size to accommodate them. For example, older adults may require a 12 point font in
Verdana to read effectively.  Additionally, use “scalable fonts” or fonts that will allow the user to increase and decrease text size using the
browser functions (e.g., View > Text Size > Larger).

Rationale:
Research has shown that fonts smaller than 11 points (Arial) elicit slower reading performance from users.








Exemption(s):
A font size of one or two points smaller than the approved points above may be used in the following situations (but in no case smaller than an
8-point font):
 • In data tables.
 • In PDF documents because of their nature and because they are expandable when opened.
 • In a navigation bar that presents secondary information such as bread crumb navigation or standard information/links that appear in the
   “footer” of a page.
 • For notices or disclaimers.  For example: Documents in PDF format require the Adobe Acrobat Reader®.
 • To present information and/or links in the footer of a Web page.  For example:  This is an official U.S. Government Web site managed by the
   U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
Font Size and Typeface (Continued)


 • To present secondary information that describes a prime link or piece of content.  For example:


   Confirmed Human Cases by Country
   [Note: Numbers are confirmed by World Health Organization and may not reflect news or country reports.]

 • When you provide a “page text sizer” control that allows users to increase or decrease a font size.  Examples of a page text sizer include: A
   A A and Text Size: SM MD LG XL

Designing and Employing Check Boxes

Standard:
HHS must use a check box control to allow users to select one or more items from a list of possible choices. In addition, a control that allows
users to clear checked box selections must also be provided.

Also, users should be able to select an option by clicking on either the box itself or its label.

Rationale:
Users should be able to select each check box independently of all other check boxes. One study showed that for making multiple selections from
a list of non-mutually exclusive items, check boxes elicit the fastest performance and are preferred over all other widgets.

By providing users with a larger click zone area that extends to the label and the check box, they are faster at making the selection.  This is
especially true for older adults.

Designate Visited and Unvisited Links

Standard:
To designate unvisited links, HHS must use the default blue text link color (#0000FF, RGB (0,0, 255)); to designate visited links, HHS must use
the default purple link color (#800080, RGB (128,0,128)). For links that point to the same target, all links should change color to the default
purple once the target site has been visited.


Rationale:
Link colors help users understand which parts of a Web site they have visited.  Providing this feedback, according to several studies, helps
improve users’ speed in finding information.  In addition, this color convention is considered a common experience for users on the Web.  By
following long understood conventions, we reduce users’ confusion and improve their overall success rates.

Exemptions:
Primary site navigation links that represent the major categories and topics of a site are exempt.  This primary navigation is typically
presented on the homepage and may be persistent across a Web site.  Examples of primary navigation items include tabs and left, right, and
middle panels (navigation bars).  Graphic examples are provided below:

Related Guidelines:
 • Provide Consistent Clickability Cues (Source: HHS Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines)

Use Text for Links

Standard:
HHS must not use images alone as links. Links must be text.  If an image is clickable, a text description must be used in addition to the image
(along with the required alt tag).  In that case, both the image and text must be clickable.  View the “Requirements” section below for format.

When providing a list of links, HHS should provide context descriptions with each unless the context description indicates, in one sentence or
phrase, what the user will find at the linked page.  View the “Requirements” section below for format.

Rationale:
Text links are more easily recognized as clickable, usually download faster than images, are preferred by users, and change colors after being
selected.  In addition, it is easier to convey a link’s destination in text, rather than using an image.  Another benefit to using text links is
that users with text-only and deactivated graphical browsers can see the navigation options.  In one study, users showed considerable confusion
regarding whether or not certain images were clickable; this was true even for images that contained words. Users could not tell if the images
were clickable without placing their cursor over them.

Adding brief context descriptions to a set of link titles can help users better understand the distinction between their options. Context
descriptions should be brief and add value to the link title.


Exemptions:
 • Context descriptions are not required on the Home pages of HHS Web sites because they function as menus or quick links.
 • Small thumbnail images that link to larger images (of the thumbnail) are exempt from this standard.
 • An agency logo does not need text, but it still needs a text link if there is no text option.
 • Graphics that are primarily text (e.g., tabs) are exempt.
 • With tabbed navigation, the navigation bars are exempt.

Distinguish Required Data Entry Fields

Standard:
HHS must clearly and consistently distinguish required data entry fields from optional data entry fields. HHS must use ONE of the following
approaches to distinguish required data entry fields:

 • Provide an asterisk in front of the label for required fields.  In addition, HHS must provide text stating: “A field with an asterisk (*)
   before it is a required field.”  This statement must precede the beginning of the data entry form.
 • Provide the word “(Required)” in front of the label for required fields. In addition, HHS must provide text stating: “All required fields
   have the word (Required) in front of a label.”  This statement must precede the beginning of the data entry form.
 • Separate fields into required and optional when practical.  These groupings must be clearly labeled “Required” and “Optional” and include the
   statement: “Fields are organized into required and optional groupings.”


Rationale:
Users should be able to easily determine which data entry fields are required and which are optional.  Many sites are currently using an
asterisk in front of the label for required fields. Some sites cluster required and optional fields to assist the user.

To comply with Section 508, it is not sufficient to use color or bold to emphasize required fields.  Colorblind users or those using screen
readers will not get the information.

Related Guidelines: [Note: Related Web Guidelines from HHS’ Research-Based Web Design & Usability Guidelines and other relevant sources will be

Use Radio Buttons for Exclusive Selections

Standards:
HHS must provide radio buttons when users need to choose one, and only one, response from a list of mutually exclusive options. HHS must always
use at least two radio buttons in connection with each other.  A single radio button must not be used to present a lone item.

If users can choose not to activate any of the radio button choices, HHS must provide a selection labeled “None.”  Designers and developers
should assign one of the radio button choices as the default, when appropriate.

Since radio buttons require only one choice, make sure that the options are both comprehensive and clearly distinct.

In addition, users should be able to select an option by clicking on either the button itself or its label. By providing users with a larger
click zone area that includes both the label and the button, users will be faster at making the selection.  This is especially true for older
adults.

Rationale:
Radio buttons are a series of on-screen buttons that allow only one selection to be made from a group of options.  By following the standards
above, radio buttons can be used for optimal user performance.

Design for Dominant Screen Resolutions

Standard:
HHS must design for monitors with the screen resolution set at 1024x768 pixels, but use a liquid layout that works well for any resolution, from
800x600 to 1280x1024.


Rationale:
As of December 2006, fifty-four percent of users have their screen resolution set at 1024x768. By designing for screens set at 1024x768,
designers will accommodate this most common resolution, while balancing tradeoffs for those using 800x600 and 1280x1024.  Designers and coders
should test Web pages in the most common screen displays to ensure good visibility, legibility, and aesthetics.  Please note:  As resolutions
are increasing, some users are viewing Web sites in smaller browser windows.

You may get an exemption from this standard if:
    • Your web site logs or other data collection efforts indicate that the majority of your users have set resolutions other than 1024x768.
    • Pages, other than menu pages, may be exempt if there is a clear and present need for more tightly controlled dimensions to work with column
      widths, text boxes, images, or navigation widgets.

Design Using Most Common Browsers and Operating Systems

Standard:
HHS should design, develop, and test for the most common browser (Internet Explorer release 6.x, as of December 2006) and Operating Systems (OS)
(Windows XP, as of December 2006); however HHS must design websites that display without significant degradation for users using other browsers,
such as Firefox, Safari, Netscape, Opera, and older versions of Internet Explorer (releases lower than 6.x) and other operating systems such as
Windows 2000, Windows 98, and OS X.

Rationale:
The goal is that users should be able to view Web content without having to use a particular browser.  To ensure that Web browsers are
displaying content without significant differences, designers and coders should view the Web pages in different Web browsers on different
Operating Systems.
The preferred way to accomplish this is to design with browser and OS neutral code (HTML 4.x, XHTML 1.x, etc).  This means avoiding IE-specific
and XP-specific code and active X controls.

 • If you currently employ Web applications that don’t display or work well using the most common browsers and/or operating systems.  These
   applications may be “grandfathered” in. [Note: more details on how this will be handled will be developed with the HHS OPDIV and STAFFDIV Web
   Representatives.]  However, you must provide a prominent notice describing what browsers and/or operating systems work best with the
   application, as well as information on how to obtain said browsers.

Presenting Links to Materials in Multiple Languages

Standard:
When foreign language content is available, HHS must present links to this material on its menu pages (e.g., the homepage) and content pages.
Furthermore, links to foreign language materials must be presented in their language (i.e., En Español, not In Spanish). However, if you need to
accommodate both non-English and English speakers (e.g., those who need to find information for a non-English speaking patient or family
member), then provide the non-English version in parenthesis.  For example: Français (French).  View the “Requirements” section below for
format.

Rationale:
Usability testing has found that users searching for information in multiple languages prefer to find all versions grouped together on a Web
site.  On document or content pages, users also expect to find what versions are available for themselves, colleagues, or patients and the
public.

Exception(s): N/A

Sources: [Note: this field is a placeholder.  It will provide detailed references and will be hidden from view in the online version.]

Requirements (content & style):
Comment:  Link text (title of document) should be in the language as the content of the document.
Another option is to have a clickable option En Español; when the person clicks on it, the web site is made available in Spanish.

Use Appropriate List Style

Standard:
HHS must use bulleted lists to present items of equal status or value, and numbered lists if a particular order to the items is warranted.

Rationale:
Numbered lists imply rank, sequence, or order.  Bulleted lists generally present items in a random order.  Numbered lists are especially
important when giving instructions.

Use Mixed Case with Prose Content

Standard:
HHS must use mixed upper- and lower-case letters when displaying continuous prose text.  This standard will apply to headlines, headers, and
links, as well as the body of content.

If a phrase is intended to attract the user’s attention, display the phrase in bold or italics.  Only use these methods to emphasize one or two
words, or a short phrase, because they slow reading performance when used for extended prose. They also cease being eye-catching.

Rationale:
TEXT PRESENTED IN ALL CAPS IS DIFFICULT TO READ.  Reading text is easier when capitalization is used conventionally to start sentences and to
indicate proper nouns and acronyms.

 Acceptable: Use mixed case with prose
 Acceptable: Use Mixed Case with Prose

Appropriate Use of Images on Web Pages

Standard:
HHS should use images only when they communicate supplemental information or otherwise enhance understanding. Images must serve a specific
informational purpose, i.e., provide support to the content, rather than simply serve as decoration.

Rationale:
A Web site’s graphics should add value and increase the clarity of the information on the site.  Adding unnecessary graphics pushes important
content down a page—thus improving the chance it will be missed—and reduces the space available to present other important information.  In
addition, users tend to be frustrated if they wait several seconds for a graphic to download and then find that the image does not add any
value.  Users also tend to have negative reactions to sites that display photos of agency staff or stock photography that offer no informational
value to the content they are viewing.

Exemptions:
The use of traditional agency graphics, logos, headers, and mastheads on a Web site is exempt.  Additionally, you are exempt from this standard
if:
 • You can justify how an image fits within the mission of your Web site. For example, if your site is geared toward a specialized audience, such
   as children who may require visual content to learn, then strategic use of graphics is allowed.
 • The purpose of your page is to provide press release photos or event photos.
 • Logical images or icons are strategically used to call attention to a specific part of a page. Again, caution must be used as usability test
   findings indicate that users ignore images and icons that look like commercial ads.

Present RSS and Podcast Links in a Consistent Format

Standard:
When presenting RSS and Podcast features on a Web site, HHS must follow the standard format and terminology provided below.  HHS must use the
word RSS or Podcast to identify the technology, not XML or other terminology or icon.  In addition, HHS must provide a “Help” link describing
RSS and Podcasts.  View requirements section below for format.

Rationale:
RSS and Podcast are increasingly being used on HHS Web sites to communicate information.  To help users understand and use these features, the
terminology and layout used to present them should be consistent.

Provide File Type and Size with Downloadable Files

Standard:
HHS must provide file format type and size information with all non-HTML file-types such as Adobe Acrobat (PDF), MS Word (DOC), and Adobe Flash
(SWF) files.

When linking to a single file format that is not in HTML or another browser-friendly format, place the file format notice at the link level and
use this format, Subject/name of file (file format – file size OR number of pages or minutes).

When linking to multiple file formats that are not in HTML or another browser-friendly format, place the file format notices at the link level
and use this format, Subject/name of the file (file format#1 – file size OR number of pages or minutes) (file format#2 – file size OR number of
pages or minutes).  View the “Requirements” section below for format.

In addition, HHS must provide help instructions on how and where to access necessary plug-ins needed to view non-HTML files. These instructions
must be available from a prominent location—such as a linked notice placed at the top of a Web page or in the footer location—and must be used
on all relevant Web pages. View the “Requirements” section below for format.

Rationale:
OMB guidance for public facing Web sites and HHS usability test findings indicate that users want to know the file type.  Users with low
bandwidth want to get a sense of the time required to view a resource. In addition, you should provide instructions for downloading viewers
and/or players on all Web pages providing non-HTML files.

                        AHRQ Linking Policy

Introduction

Hyperlinks allow users to move from concept to concept in a nonlinear fashion. This is a technology used to structure and navigate the World
Wide Web.
Most often referred to simply as links, this simple Web function permits associative references to other sections within Web documents, other
documents and files on a Web site, and other Web sites and Web-based resources.
Links can be internal—that is, established to materials contained on a single Web server and resident to that Web site. Links can be
external—that is, point to materials that are resident on other Web servers or applications that are maintained by outside entities.

Requirements


                                                                 1 Internal Links

Internal links do not create any liability issues because the materials are on the same server. However, these links serve as one method of
navigation within a site and they should facilitate use of a Web site, not confuse or disorient users so that they become "lost in cyberspace."
As part of creating a navigation architecture that allows the user to maintain orientation, be consistent in the use of hypertext links in lists
and the level of the target for these links to subcategories of information.
Hypertext links placed within content should direct users to more detailed information, but clearly indicate where the target of the link is
located with a brief description of what that link contains. For this reason, it is better to have links to other materials at the end of
sections rather than buried in the middle of paragraphs.

                                                                 2 External Links

External links to other Web sites constitute an "implied endorsement" and create a business advantage for the linked sites. Therefore, the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires Federal Agencies to do a risk assessment of external links from their sites.
For AHRQ-funded resources, potential links to external sources need to be assessed against Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and
AHRQ linking policies and criteria.
If a site can make a case for deviating from these policies, then the specific review and selection criteria must be justified and posted on the
Web site for full disclosure.
Before establishing links to external sites, check on the linking policies of those sites. Even if the sites do not require permission to
establish a link, you should notify Web sites of your intention to establish a link as a courtesy because your links will drive traffic to the
other sites and create demand on their servers.
Outside Web resources may link to Agency resources, providing the link is not displayed in any way that would imply an endorsement by the Agency
of a specific commercial product or service. Each AHRQ-funded Web site should have a page that discusses the "Linking In" policy and provides a
25-word descriptor for the site with key words that other sites can use when establishing the link.

                                                           3 AHRQ Policies and Criteria

Criteria for selection of external Web links are explained in accompanying AHRQ documents on linking policy, criteria, and evaluation. It is
best to take a conservative approach to external linking as the Agency cannot appear to recommend sites which are incompatible with its scope
and mission. Principle requirements include:
    • Links should be limited to other Federal agencies (particularly other HHS agencies), non-profit organizations which partner with AHRQ for
      specific projects, and other selected non-commercial Web resources, such as State and local government resources or educational
      institutions.
    • Links to other Web-based resources should only be established if they are specifically referenced in AHRQ Web documents and directly relate
      to the Agency mission and outputs. Even these need to be evaluated against several quality and risk-assessment criteria.
    • Linked sites should not conflict with any Federal policies or regulations.
    • Links to commercial sites which market products or services are generally not appropriate nor are links to sites which charge for
      information. However, this does not exclude notices of the availability of publications by public agencies or non-profit organizations that
      charge for the publications or notices of conferences and meetings which charge a registration fee, providing these are directly related to
      the Agency mission and initiatives.
The Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) reviews links for any AHRQ Web-based resources maintained internally and housed on
AHRQ servers for compliance with the Agency policy and selection criteria. For contractor-maintained servers, it is the responsibility of the
contractor to assess links and post only those links which meet selection and evaluation criteria.
External links must be clearly delineated as such and a brief description should be provided about the content of each linked resource. The link
URL can be transparent to the user, but keep in mind that providing the specific URL for the linked resource has greater utility for the user
when the Web pages are printed and subsequently referenced. Be consistent in the conventions that you use to designate external links.  See
external link disclaimer below:
[pic]
Once links are established, they need to be re-assessed on a periodic basis to ensure that the links are still valid and that the linked
resources continue to meet selection criteria.
These principles may not cover all possibilities and circumstances. Specific cases that present new issues must be evaluated on their merits in
keeping with the goals and mission of AHRQ.

                                                            4 Additional Portal Links

The General Services Administration (GSA) requires that all federally funded sites in the government domain provide a link to the GSA portal,
FirstGov, from the home page of the funded site. These site are, in turn, indexed through the FirstGov portal.
AHRQ also has reciprocal links established with two health portals funded under HHS auspices: healthfinder® and MEDLINEplus®, both of which
provide information on diseases, conditions, and wellness issues, and other consumer health information and decision tools.
There may be other E-Government initiatives for portals where incoming or outgoing links will need to be established depending on the purpose
and content of the Web-based resource.

Tools and Resources


                                                    1 AHRQ Web Site External Linking Criteria

AHRQ Web Site External Linking Criteria summarizes selection and review criteria for external links from the AHRQ Web site.

Selection Criteria
Active links to sites external to AHRQ Web resources can only be made to:
    • DHHS and other Government agency Web sites.
    • Non-profit organization Web resources that reflect the outputs of specific projects or conferences of AHRQ with official partners (specific
      URL, not Home Page).
    • Non-commercial resources that are specifically referenced in AHRQ-generated Web documents (specific URL, not Home Page).
Review Criteria
    • External links should only be established to sites or Web-based resources that are directly related to AHRQ's mission and outputs.
    • External links must not present conflicts with official Agency, HHS, or other Federal policies or regulations.
    • Links to external resources cannot imply endorsement of a specific commercial product or service (Title 44 USC).

      potential embarrassment, or political ramifications.
    • Content is accurate, scientifically sound, balanced, and current (pages show updates).
    • Sources of all content are specifically identified and references are provided for health and scientific claims.
    • The sponsoring organization(s), aims, and sources of support are clearly identified.
    • Biases or conflicts of interest from advocacy positions, marketing, or sources of financial support are explicitly acknowledged.
    • Privacy and confidentiality matters are clearly addressed, and registration is not required.
    • Contact information and feedback exist for both content and technical issues.
    • The design, reading level, and navigation tools are appropriate for the intended audience and do not present barriers to users.

                                                       2 External Link Evaluation Checklist

The External Link Evaluation Checklist is an evaluation document that is used to assess potential external links. Copies of these assessments
should be kept on file for the life of a project to show that you performed due diligence in selecting and evaluating external links and to
address any challenges to the linking policy of your Web site by outside entities.

References and Authorities


                                                     1 AHRQ Web Site External Linking Policy

The AHRQ Web Site External Linking Policy summarizes the issues, principles, and selection criteria that apply to the AHRQ Web site.  Under its
current policy, AHRQ links only to:
    • Other HHS agencies.
    • Other Federal agencies.
    • Non-profit organizations that are official partners on specific projects or conferences.
    • Non-commercial Web resources that are specifically referenced in AHRQ-generated Web documents.
Issues
The following issues affect the external linking policy:
    • Under basic guidance from OMB, Federal agencies are expected to conduct a risk assessment before providing external links from their Web
      sites.
    • Links to other sites are viewed as both an implied endorsement and a conduit to traffic, providing a business advantage for selected sites.


    • Given the ephemeral nature of the Web, content can frequently change on linked resources.
    • Web sites with external links must be regularly monitored for dead links or changed links.
    • Resources are required to determine potential links, review and evaluate them, establish agreements between sites, and maintain and update
      links.
Principles
The following principles apply to the external linking policy:
    • Selection criteria as established are to be followed for recommending links.
    • Review criteria as established are to be followed for evaluating links.
    • Disclosure language that addresses the policy, selection, and review criteria must be posted on any Web site that has external links.
    • OCKT reviews recommendations and makes final determinations on appropriate links.
    • OCKT negotiates linking arrangements, addresses requests from external sources, and responds to challenges on linking decisions.
    • OCKT provides oversight and periodic re-evaluation of linked resources (at least on a quarterly basis).
Selection Criteria
A number of general guidelines for evaluating the quality of health Web sites have been published, and AHRQ has been involved in several public-
private collaborations that have addressed this issue.
Existing criteria that are broadly accepted include:
    • Content is accurate, scientifically sound, balanced, and current (pages show updates).
    • Sources of all content are specifically identified and references are provided for health and scientific claims.
    • The sponsoring organization(s), aims, and sources of support are clearly identified.
    • Biases or conflicts of interest from advocacy positions, marketing, or sources of financial support are explicitly acknowledged.
    • Privacy and confidentiality matters are clearly addressed.
    • Contact information and feedback exist for both content and technical issues.
    • The design, reading level, and navigation tools are appropriate for the intended audience and do not present barriers to users.
Additional criteria that affect AHRQ as a Federal Web site and agency of HHS:
    • External links should only be established to sites or Web-based resources that are related to AHRQ's mission.
    • External links must not present conflicts with official Agency, HHS, or other Federal policies or regulations.
    • Links to external resources cannot imply endorsement of a specific commercial product or service (Title 44 USC).
    • Linked resources must be in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act and other accessibility guidelines as directed by the
      Department of Justice.
    • Linked resources should not contain inappropriate or questionable materials that jeopardize the Agency through associated liability,
      potential embarrassment, or political ramifications.

                                                  2 Criteria for HHS External Web Site Selection

Criteria for HHS External Web Site Selection provides guidelines for policy development and practical application of best practices for linking
HHS-sponsored Web sites to external Web sites and resources.  A number of general guidelines to evaluate the quality and reliability of health
information Web sites have been published. The following guidelines combine criteria from several external sources
(http://intranet.hhs.gov/#external#external) and existing guidelines (http://intranet.hhs.gov/#existing#existing) with considerations relevant
to HHS agencies whose missions include a public information component determine which information should be included in their HHS Web sites.
These criteria can also be used to narrow the field of candidate sites for links to avoid information overload for users and reduce link
maintenance.
Agencies should build upon these guidelines with examples specific to their own sites to develop operating procedures. Those procedures should
recognize that no Web site is likely to meet all criteria. However, criteria provide appropriate guidance for staff to use in assessing the
communication needs and the relative risks and benefits of linkages for their specific Web sites.
   A. On-line health information providers or sources should meet the following core criteria to be included in or linked to from an HHS Web
      site.
        1. Content is accurate, scientifically sound, balanced, and current.
        2. Sources of all content are specifically identified.
        3. References are provided for health and scientific claims.
        4. Site indicates that content is updated regularly (pages show dates).
        5. Qualifications of persons or organizations providing any medical or health advice are clearly presented; trained professionals or an
           advisory board oversees such activities.
        6. Information provided is designed to support, not replace, the patient/provider relationship and appropriate disclaimers are present.
        7. A privacy policy statement is prominently displayed. Minimum elements of a privacy policy are discussed below.
        8. Sponsoring organization(s), aims, and sources of support are clearly identified.
        9. Biases or conflicts of interest resulting from strong advocacy positions, marketing or advertising, or sources of support are
           explicitly acknowledged.
       10. Marketing information and advertising are presented in a manner that would allow an average user to clearly distinguish between
           commercial content and other information presented.
       11. Contact information and a feedback mechanism for both content and technical issues are available.
       12. Design, reading level, search tools, site navigation, and interactive components are appropriate for the intended audience and do not
           present barriers to users.
   B. Privacy protections for personal information. A Web site's privacy policy should:
        1. Notify users of which information is collected about them while they are on the site.
        2. Explain how the information will be used, shared and protected.
        3. Include a requirement to ask users for explicit permission to collect, track, aggregate, or share personally identifiable
           information.
   C. Beyond core selection criteria, HHS-specific considerations include the following. HHS Web sites should link to or recommend only those
      information sources that:
        1. Are directly relevant to HHS programs, activities, communication goals, or target populations.
        2. Comply with the Americans With Disability Act, and World Wide Web Consortium and other accessibility guidelines, as directed by the
           Department of Justice.
        3. Provide balanced treatment of topics addressed on the Web site.
   D. HHS sites should be clear on the relationship between the HHS site and any linked sites. There are currently multiple means to indicate to
      users that they are accessing content on a non-HHS site, including disclaimers, exit notices and pop-up boxes. Technology is constantly
      changing, however, and mandating a specific technical solution does not always provide the highest standard of user protection. The
      technical solution to clarify the relationship between HHS and non-HHS content, therefore, will be left to individual HHS agencies and Web
      sites.
   E. In the case of on-line discussion forums, HHS Web sites should link to or recommend only those forums that use qualified people to moderate
      or regularly review the discussion for inaccurate content.
   F. HHS Web sites should not link to or recommend information sources that:
        1. Conflict with official agency, HHS, or other Federal policies or regulations.
        2. Include invalid or unsupported health claims or invalid or unsupported science.
        3. Violate Federal or State laws and regulations governing the practice of medicine or the dispensing of pharmaceuticals across State
           lines or national borders.
        4. Imply endorsement of products or services by the Department.
        5. Allow targeted advertising by topic (for example, search on diabetes and get a specific drug ad).
        6. Imply endorsement of advocacy efforts targeting Federal laws, regulations, or policies.
        7. Do not disclose the nature of the partnerships and affiliations of contributors to the Web site and related projects.
        8. Provide secondary linkages that lead to inappropriate content.
        9. Require registration (anonymous use should be possible) or charge fees for basic information.

Section 1: PDF Files
A PDF file must be properly tagged for accessibility and rendered correctly by an assistive technology (AT) device. If a PDF file cannot not be
properly tagged or rendered, by an AT device, then an alternative format must be provided. The alternative format for internet Web pages is
HTML, TXT, or RTF.

Issues: PDF is a graphical format and assistive technology devices cannot correctly interpret the information unless properly tagged for
accessibility. Alternative formats must provide meaningful information that is equivalent to the original document.

How to Test: Use a screen-reader to determine if the information is correctly interpreted. Validate the content in the alternative format to
insure it is equivalent to the original content and updated if any changes are made to the original file.

5. Have you provided an alternative format for PDF files such as HTML, TXT, or RTF formats?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not include PDF files


6. Have you provided a link to the appropriate plug-in (PDF Help)?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not include PDF files


Section 2: Forms
Forms that are to be completed on-line must allow assistive technologies to take direction and cues from the form's information, field element
completion, and submission of the form.

Issues: Forms must provide adequate information and purpose for a user to fill out the form. Form fields must be accessible and navigable
through the form. If a form has a 'timed out' feature, the user must be notified of this constraint up front and a provision must be made to
allow the user to request additional time to complete the form.

How to Test: Check that there is adequate information provided for a user to complete the form. Check for proper tab order. The tabbing order is
to be through the form first, then natural order tabbing. Check for proper form markup so that forms can interpret the form fields correctly.

7. Do all form fields have a <LABEL> tag?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this pages does not use form fields

8. Do all form fields have a tabindex attribute?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this pages does not use form fields

9. Do your forms fields allow a person using assistive technology to access information, field elements, and functionality for completion and
submission of the form including all directions and cues?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ Yes, but... not tested for usability with assistive technology
    c. ___ Yes, but... not sure it complies with all the accessibility requirements despite testing
    d. ___ No
    e. ___ N/A, this page does not use form fields

10. If your form fields are inaccessible to people with disabilities is there an alternative accessible form or a link to an accessible form?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not use form fields


Section 3: Tables
Tables are to be constructed so that all users can interpret the original intent of the author. Row and column headers must be identified for
data tables. Associate data cells with their headers for all tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers.

Issues:  Tables need to be properly marked-up using HTML 4.x or higher coding standards.  Tabular tables need to be summarized to convey
information and an overview of the table's content. Current assistive technology devices do not adequately read HTML 4.x code, but future
versions will be designed to interpret table tags and attributes.


How to Test: Check for 'summary' attribute in the Table tag. The 'summary' tag is only visible to the assistive technology device and not the
visual user. Check for the Caption tag; this is optional but does provide a title to the table. Check for the headers and id attributes. If the
headers and id attributes are not used, then check for the 'scope' attribute and the 'row' and 'col' elements. For a complex table, use the
'axis' attribute. The 'axis' attribute can only be used with 'id' and 'headers' attributes. It will not work with the 'scope’ attribute.

11. If you use tables for design layout, have you checked to see if the tables read in a linear method?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, I do not use tables for design layout

12. Do your tabular tables use the 'summary' attribute and/or tag?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, I do not use tabular tables

13. Does each table cell provide identification of row and column headers?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not use tables


Section 4: Frames
Frameset should not require the user to depend on visual cues to navigate the site. Frames must be titled for frame identification and
navigation.

Issues: Frames need meaningful descriptive text for navigation. Include the Name attribute because assistive technology devices may or may not
read the Title attribute. Some assistive technology devices default to the Src attribute if the Name attribute is missing.

How to Test: Check for 'title' attribute and tag with descriptive text for each frame. The Name attribute requires meaningful text for
navigation, but not as descriptive as the Title attribute.

15. Does each frame use the "title" attribute to properly describe the frame?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not contain frames


Section 5: Scripts, Plug-ins, Applets
Pages utilizing scripting languages to display content or to create interface elements must provide meaningful text that can be read by
assistive technology. If meaningful text cannot be rendered, then the page must provide an equivalent alternative. A link to a plug-in or applet
that complies with §1194.21 (Software Applications and Operating Systems) must be present when a component of a Web page requires an applet,
plug-in, or other application to be present.

Issues:  Assistive technology devices may not support scripts, applets, or plug-ins causing the assistive technology device to not convey
meaningful information to the user. Plug-ins or applications may not be accessible to assistive technology devices. If a script, applet, plug-
in, or application cannot be compliant, then provide a text-only page that is updated when the original content is updated.

How to Test: Use an assistive technology device to check scripts for equivalent content. Check to see if <applets> or <OBJECT> have an 'alt'
attribute to provide equivalent information. Provide a direct link to the most current plug-in for download. Use an assistive technology device
to check an application for equivalent content.

16. If the page uses scripts, is the script accessible to the screen reader or is there equivalent text provided?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not use scripts

17. Do your applets, such as a JAVA applet, contain the same information and functionality in an accessible format?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A. this page does not use applets

18. If you use a plug-in, such as Flash, Windows Media, Real Audio, etc., have you provided a link to download the plug-in?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not use plug-ins

19. If you require a plug-in, does the plug-in comply with Section 508, 1194.21 (Software Applications and Operating Systems)?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not use plug-ins

20. If you have an application or tool, is it accessible or is an alternative provided that contains the same information and functionality in
an accessible format?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not use applications


Section 6: Non-Text Elements
Non-text elements that provide information require a descriptive text equivalent for meaningful content or to facilitate navigation, e.g.,
images, graphs, charts, animation, etc.

Issues: Assistive Technology devices cannot provide meaningful information about non-text elements without equivalent descriptive text. If more
information is required to convey meaningful content, then use the 'longdesc' attribute of D-Link. The 'longdesc' attribute is not supported by
I.E. 6.x, Netscape 6.x, AOL 7.0 or less, but use it to prevent future remediation of the Web page.

How to Test: Review the source code for 'alt' attribute for images. Verify link provided by the 'londesc' attribute and D-Link. Check images
(including animation) by placing the mouse over the image. Check for equivalent and meaningful descriptive for the image.

21. Do all non-text elements have text equivalent descriptions using the "alt" attribute or an alternative method for equivalent description?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, there are no non-text elements on this page


Section 7: Image Maps
Client-side image maps are to be used in place of server-side image maps, except when the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric
shape. Server-side image maps must provide redundant text links for the image map hot spots.

Issues: Assistive technology devices cannot read server-side image maps because they are external to the HTML document. Client-side image maps
must provide equivalent text of the images including text links for all hot spots.

How to Test: Check code the 'alt' attribute in the <IMG> and <AREA> tags. Check for 'usemap' (client-side) as opposed to 'ismap' (server-side)
attributes. Verify that all links work. If image cannot be compliant, then check to make sure that there is a text-only equivalent.

22. Does your page have duplicate text links for all links within the server-side image?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A. this page does not have server-side images

23. Do you have a timetable to replace your server-side images with client-side images?
    a. ___ Yes, will change to client-side images by: ___________
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not have server-side images

24. Do your client-side images use the "alt" attribute to provide text equivalent description and/or an alternative method to provide text
equivalent description?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ Yes/No, some non-text elements have text equivalents, but not all
    c. ___ No
    d. ___ N/A, this page does not have client-side images

Section 8: Multi-media
For all training and informational video and multimedia productions, regardless of format, provide synchronized video captioning and/or audio
description for video and audio output.
    • Speech or other audio information necessary for the comprehension of the content shall be open or closed captioned.
    • Visual information necessary for the comprehension of the content shall be audio described.
Issues: Visually impaired users cannot interpret the video content without some equivalent option. Audible-impaired users cannot interpret audio
content without some equivalent content. If a Web page uses a player or plug-in to render multimedia, then a link must be provided for that
player or plug-in per section §1194.21 (Software Applications and Operating Systems), players and plug-ins must be accessible.

How to Test: Check for video captioning and audio description. Check for link to player or plug-in. Check with vendor for player or plug-in
conformance to Section 508 requirements.

25. Is text captioning provided for audible output and audible output provided for visual information?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, there is no multimedia content on this page


26. If you have multimedia content, is the audible and video output synchronized to the dynamic content?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ Yes/No, audible output is synchronized to important video information
    c. ___ Yes/No, text captioning is synchronized to audible output
    d. ___ No
    e. ___ N/A, there is no multimedia content on this page


Section 9: Color
Web pages should not depend on color for information or navigation of a Web page.

Issues: Users with low vision or who are colorblind may not be able to correctly read text of certain font sizes or color (i.e., normal red
text), distinguish among navigation or control buttons on Web pages that use color (e.g., select the green button), or read text or features on
Web pages if the background and foreground colors are too close in contrast.

How to Test: Check the Web page using a monochrome monitor or by printing the page with the setting to gray scale.
Check the page using a high contrast setting such as white on black.

27. Are you able to navigate or understand the page without the use of color?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No


Section 10: Navigation and Design
Provide a method that will allow users of assistive technology devices the option to skip repetitive links. Design pages that do not cause
screen flicker or blink a frequency between 2 HZ (2 times per second) and 55 Hz (55 times per second). If a Web page cannot be compliant, then
provide a text-only page that is equivalent and updated when the non-compliant page is updated. Use descriptive text for links and “Go to” or
“Select” instead of "Click here" or “More…” with lengthy URL or mailto addresses.

Issues: Repetitive links can be confusing and irritating to users with assistive technology devices when going from page to page. Screen flicker
on Web pages, within certain frequencies, can cause fatigue and seizure. A text-only page alternative is costly to maintain and should be
considered only if you cannot make a page compliant. Multiple "Click here" or "More..." links do not convey enough information to users of
screen or Braille readers to distinguish between the links and they do not have a mouse to click. Lengthy URL and mailto addresses can be
confusing because readers interpret the information in the context of whole words. A text link provides more information to the visual and
adaptive technology user.

How to Test: Check for a pixel, transparent, gif, or text link to allow users of assistive technology devices to move to the main content of the
page. Look for screen flicker and blinking animated gifs. Ensure that the text-only page is accessible and that it has information equivalent to
the original document. Check for "Click here" and “More…” links.

28. Do your pages provide a method for assistive technology to skip repetitive links including navigational links?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not need navigational or repetitive links


29. Have you replaced "Click here" and “More…” links with “Go to,” “Select,” or “Visit” descriptive headings or URLs?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
30. If your page requires a fixed time for response before the page 'times out', is the user alerted that he or she will be timed out and given
sufficient time to indicate that more time is needed?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A. this page does not have a 'time out' feature


31. Does the “include content,” such as applets, plug-ins, or animation, cause the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz or less
than 55 Hz?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
32. If this page cannot be made accessible, do you have a 'text only' version that is updated the same time the inaccessible page is updated?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page is accessible


Section 11: Style Sheets
Content on a Web page must use layout that allows the page to be readable without a style sheet.

Issues: A Web page using a style sheet is not properly rendered when the style sheet is not used or not supported by a browser. Content on pages
may appear to be layered on top of each other.
How to Test: Turn off style sheets in the browser. Put the style sheet on a separate page to test for proper reading. Check for absolute
positioning instead of relative positioning. Ensure that accommodations are made for various browsers.

33. If the page has style sheets, is it viewable by a user's browser that does not support style sheets?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not have style sheets

34. Does the style sheet interfere with style sheets set by the user's browser?
    a. ___ Yes
    b. ___ No
    c. ___ N/A, this page does not have style sheets

Tips for Testing
Automated validation methods are generally rapid and convenient but cannot identify all accessibility issues. Human review can help ensure
clarity of language and ease of navigation.

Use the following method for validating your Web pages:

1. Review your code using HTML 4.01 coding practices. HTML 4.01 code can be checked and validated at the W3C HTML Validation site
(http://validator.w3.org/). This site does not check your code or Web page for accessibility.
2. Use an assistive technology device to determine whether information can be interpreted correctly on the Web page.   
Screen Readers:
      [pic] IBM Home Reader 3.0 (http://www.ibm.com)
      [pic] JAWS for Windows (http://www.freedomscientific.com/)
      [pic] Window-Eyes (http://www.GWmicro.com/)

3. Use W3C's CSS Validation Service (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for validating your style sheets. This validates code only, not
accessibility.
4. Test the Web pages with the keyboard only; rather than an event-driven device (mouse, etc).
5. Test the Web pages with sounds, graphics, and style sheets turned off.
