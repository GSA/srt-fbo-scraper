HSTS04-11-R-CT2002 1.0 SCOPE

This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for the design, manufacture, test and test support, and delivery of the Automated Wait Time hereinafter referred to as the AWT. The AWT is intended to provide the capability to capture the amount of time a passenger spends waiting in the checkpoint security line. The AWT system will accurately record and report wait time data. The AWT system will operate transparently and be capable of logging the entry and exit of passengers in the security checkpoint queue. The AWT system will not collect data that is linked to an individual`s identity. The AWT will address both normal travel and peak travel periods when the volume of passengers exceeds the capacity of a given checkpoint queue area. This SOW includes requirements for program management, systems engineering management, quality assurance, configuration management, test and evaluation, training, and integrated logistics support. 1.1 Background

A consequence of securing our nation`s airports has been the creation of checkpoints fed by lines of people who must wait their turn to be cleared for entry into the sterile areas of a terminal. These lines ebb and flow throughout the day and peak during holidays and other popular travel periods. Wait time data is an important element in evaluating the effectiveness of TSA`s staffing models in order to effectively manage these lines. While TSA has used manual processes to collect wait-time data, such manual methods are a labor-intensive utilization of the screening workforce, and rely on small sample sizes without the detail needed to generate comprehensive staffing models. Using Automated Wait Time (AWT) systems TSA expects to monitor airport security queuing traffic patterns that provide an accurate performance metric for passenger screening waiting times. AWT systems minimize human resource requirements, optimize data point collection, and preclude disruptions to checkpoint operations. For purposes of this program, wait time is defined as the time it takes a passenger to reach the divest table from either the entrance of the checkpoint queue, or for some checkpoints in an overflow space outside of the checkpoint area. TSA does not currently have a uniform manual approach or automated system for measuring this parameter. 2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

These include Ao, Mean Down Time (MDT), Mean Uptime (MUT), Mean Time Between Critical Failures (MTBCF), and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR). The Government will provide a set of key operational performance parameters (metrics) in a document titled TSA ILS Reliability, Maintainability, Availability (RMA) Metrics Terms and Definitions,". The Contractor shall use these metrics to manage, optimize, and report on the ILS operational support provided to deployed AWTs.

39

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002 The Contractor shall prepare and deliver AWT RMA Metrics in accordance with the referenced CDRL. CDRL L023, RMA Metrics Report 4.2.1 Reliability (CLINs 0006 and 0008)

TSA uses MTBCF as the metric for determining the reliability of AWT in both the design of AWT and in the operational environment. A critical failure is a failure that prevents the equipment from performing its intended function. Critical failures are those where the Equipment cannot perform its required mission and must be repaired promptly. MTBCF is computed as: MTBCF = Total Operating Hours / Number of Critical Failures The AWT system shall meet the MTBCF listed in the AWT Functional Requirements Document, Attachment J-2, Section 3.7.1. 4.2.2 Maintainability (CLINs 0006 and 0008)

In the operational environment, TSA includes Downtime (maintainability) for calculating Ao, and considers the total operational time that an Equipment is not in a condition to perform its required mission. This includes the time from the initial notification of the critical failure until the time the Equipment is ready for acceptance and signoff by TSA. The AWT system shall meet the MTTTR listed in the Functional Requirements Document, Attachment J-2, Section 3.7.2. MTTR is a maintainability design metric. The design MTTR of the SE is the actual corrective maintenance time to repair the Equipment. This includes the time from when the technician is ready to start the repair (parts and tools in place) to when the repaired Equipment is ready for acceptance and signoff by TSA. The design MTTR shall be computed using: MTTR = Total Corrective Maintenance Time / Number of failures Where Total Corrective Maintenance Time = Duration of Corrective Maintenance adjusted for airport operating hours 4.2.3 Operational Availability (CLINs 0006 and 0008)

Ao is a performance criterion that accounts for both the reliability and maintainability of the Equipment in the operational environment, and is dependent on the Uptime and Downtime of Equipment.

40

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002 Ao is the percentage of time, over a period during operational hours, that Equipment is available to perform its required mission. It reflects all potential causes of downtime, such as administrative downtime, logistic downtime, etc, and total operational uptime of the Equipment. Ao is computed as: Ao = 4.2.4 Uptime Uptime + Downtime Mean Down Time (CLINs 0006 and 0008)

The Contractor shall maintain fielded AWT to meet the following Mean Downtime (MDT) requirements. The contractor shall include only installed units that are expected to be operational in its calculations of MDT. Units which are not operational for reasons other than equipment failure (e.g. warehoused units, hot spares, or units installed at non-working terminals) shall not be included in these calculations. Mean Downtime is calculated by dividing the total operational time that an EI is not in a condition to perform its required mission by the number of failures over a given period of time. Those failures that start and end within the same non-operational period are not included in MDT calculations. MTD 12 Hours 4.3 Government Property and Inventory Management (CLINs 0001 and 0002)

The Contractor shall maintain a property and inventory management system. All data collected become the property of the Government, and the Government shall have routine access to the data whenever deemed necessary. The Contractor`s property management system shall implement the life-cycle management of Government Property and Contractor-Acquired Property assets. 4.4 Equipment Database (CLINs 0001 and 0002)

The Contractor shall establish and maintain an Equipment database which:     Includes the entire inventory of fielded equipment maintained under this contract and which will be the basis for computation of performance metrics; Uniquely identifies each equipment by model, part number and serial number; Includes information all accumulating preventive and corrective and maintenance actions (including warranty if applicable); Contains all necessary information for the government to independently compute performance metrics;

41

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002   Includes RMA metrics data and provides the full maintenance and performance history; and Shall provide Government access and data rights to all data collected.

Payments made by the TSA under this contract, including invoice and contract financing payments, will be made by EFT, except as provided in paragraph (a)(1). If payment is made by EFT, the TSA may, at its option, also forward the associated payment information by electronic transfer. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the information transfer. (1) In the event the TSA is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either: (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the TSA to extend the payment due date until such time as the TSA can make payment by EFT (Note: See paragraph (d) of this clause for further information on suspension of payment).

55

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002
number, call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. at (800) 234-3867. In the event that the EFT information changes, the contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. (2) If the contractor has identified multiple payment receiving points (i.e., more than one remittance address and/or EFT information set) in the CCR database, and the contractor has not notified the TSA of the payment receiving point applicable to this contract, the TSA shall make payment to the first payment receiving point (EFT information set or remittance address as applicable) listed in the CCR database. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The TSA may make payment by EFT through either an Automated Clearing House (ACH) subject to the banking laws of the United States or the Federal Reserve Wire Transfer System at the TSA's option. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. (d) Suspension of payment. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other clause of this contract, the TSA is not required to make any payment under this contract until after the correct EFT payment information from the contractor has been provided to the CCR database. No invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed to be valid, as defined by the Prompt Payment Act, until correct EFT information is received into the CCR database. (2) Changes made to an existing record in the CCR database will become effective not later than the 30th day after receipt in the CCR database. However, the contractor may request that no further payments be made until the changed EFT information is implemented into the CCR database.

(e) Contractor EFT arrangements. The contractor shall designate a single financial agent capable of receiving and processing the electronic funds transfer using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The contractor shall pay all fees and charges for receipt and processing of transfers. (f) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the TSA failed to use the contractorprovided EFT information in the CCR database in the correct manner, the TSA remains responsible for (i) making a correct payment; (ii) paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because contractor-provided EFT information in the CCR database was incorrect, or was revised within 30 calendar days at the time of TSA release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and: (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, then the TSA is deemed to have made payment and the contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, then the TSA retains the right to either make payment by mail or suspend the payment in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. (g) EFT and prompt payment. (1) A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the Prompt Payment clause of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction given to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (2) When payment cannot be made by EFT because of incorrect EFT information provided by the contractor to the CCR database, no interest penalty is due after the date of the uncompleted or

56

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002
erroneous payment transaction, provided that notice of the defective EFT information is issued to the contractor within 7 calendar days after the TSA is notified of the defective EFT information. (h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the Assignment of Claims clause of this contract, the contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the contractor. EFT information, which shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the TSA, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The contractor agrees that the contractor's financial agent may notify the TSA of a change to the routing transit number, contractor account number, or account type. The TSA shall use the changed data in accordance with paragraph (d) (2) of this clause. The contractor agrees that the information provided by the agent is deemed to be correct information as if it were provided by the contractor. The contractor agrees that the agent's notice of changed EFT data is deemed to be a request by the contractor in accordance with paragraph (d) (2) that no further payments be made until the changed EFT information is implemented by the payment office. The TSA is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the contractor's financial agent. G.6 Payment Terms applicable to CLIN 0008 The Contractor shall withhold 40% from each delivery order invoice submitted under this CLIN. The final delivery order invoice under this CLIN will be the difference between the final adjusted CLIN value (see Section B) and total amount paid to date under the CLIN.

SSI HANDLING In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 114(s), SSI is information obtained or developed in the conduct of security activities, including research and development, the disclosure of which TSA has determined would:    Constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy (including, but not limited to, information contained in any personnel, medical, or similar file), Reveal trade secrets or privileged or confidential information obtained from any person, Be detrimental to the security of transportation.

SSI is a specific category of information that requires protection against disclosure. The governing document that defines the scope, categorization, handling and disposition of information deemed SSI is the 49 Code of Federal Regulations 1520 (http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov). Although it is subject to certain legal disclosure limitations, SSI is not classified national security information subject to the handling requirements governing classified information. All Federal employees and contractor employees possessing SSI are responsible for ensuring that the information and records containing SSI are safeguarded at all times from disclosure to unauthorized personnel. When the SSI for which an individual is responsible is not under the individual`s direct physical control, the individual is responsible for ensuring that it is safeguarded and protected in such a way that it is not physically or visually accessible to persons who do not have a need to know, for example: when unattended, SSI must be secured in a locked container or office, or other restricted access area. Prior to a contractor gaining access to SSI, the contractor must meet the processing requirements established by TSA Management Directive (MD) 2800.71. SECTION 508 Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105220) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, they must ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities. Federal employees and members of the public who have disabilities must have equal access to and use of information and data

58

that is comparable to that enjoyed by non-disabled Federal employees and members of the public. All EIT deliverables within this work statement shall comply with the applicable technical and functional performance criteria of Section 508 unless exempt. Specifically, the following applicable standards have been identified: 36 CFR 1194.21 ­ Software Applications and Operating Systems, applies to all EIT software applications and operating systems procured or developed under this work statement including but not limited to GOTS and COTS software. In addition, this standard is to be applied to Web-based applications when needed to fulfill the functional performance criteria. This standard also applies to some Web based applications as described within 36 CFR 1194.22. 36 CFR 1194.31 ­ Functional Performance Criteria, applies to all EIT deliverables regardless of delivery method. All EIT deliverable shall use technical standards, regardless of technology, to fulfill the functional performance criteria. 36 CFR 1194.41 ­ Information Documentation and Support, applies to all documents, reports, as well as help and support services. To ensure that documents and reports fulfill the required 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria, they shall comply with the technical standard associated with Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications at a minimum. In addition, any help or support provided in this work statement that offer telephone support, such as, but not limited to, a help desk shall have the ability to transmit and receive messages using TTY. Exceptions for this work statement have been determined by DHS and only the exceptions described herein may be applied. Any request for additional exceptions shall be sent to the COTR and determination will be made in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2. DHS has identified the following exceptions that may apply: 36 CFR 1194.2(b) ­ (COTS/GOTS products), When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the standards. If products are commercially available that meets some but not all of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best meets the standards. When applying this standard, all procurements of EIT shall have documentation of market research that identify a list of products or services that first meet the agency business needs, and from that list of products or services, an analysis that the selected product met more of the accessibility requirements than the non-selected products as required by FAR 39.2. Any selection of a product or service that meets less accessibility standards due to a significant difficulty or expense shall only be permitted under an undue burden claim and requires approval from the DHS Office on Accessible Systems and Technology (OAST) in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2. 36 CFR 1194.3(b) ­ Incidental to Contract, all EIT that is exclusively owned and used by the contractor to fulfill this work statement does not require compliance with Section 508. This exception does not apply to any EIT deliverable, service or item that will be used by any Federal employee(s) or member(s) of the public. This exception only applies to those contractors assigned to fulfill the obligations of this work statement and for the purposes of this requirement, are not considered members of the public.

H.10 Major Breach of Safety or Security (a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to TSA and compliance with safety standards and practices is a material part of this contract. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any "willful" or "repeat" violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan. (b) Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this agreement, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the agreement. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the contractor that results in compromise of classified information or sensitive security information or sensitive but unclassified information, including contractor proprietary information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.

The contractor is responsible for maintaining all assigned space(s) in a clean and orderly fashion during the course of this contract. All telephones are for conducting official Government business only. H-12 Interrelationship of Associate Contractors The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other contractors (i.e., associate contractors) in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract. It is expected that contractors working under TSA contracts will have to work together under certain conditions in order to achieve a common solution for TSA. The contractor may be required to coordinate with other such contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer (CO) and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interface and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other contractor(s) for the purpose of such work. Where the contractor and an associate contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant CO and furnish the Contractor`s recommendations for a solution.

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ) , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror`s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002
Offerors shall submit Testing & Evaluation Prerequisite Information electronically to the following addresses: Melyssa Bertucci at Melyssa.Bertucci@dhs.gov; and Lance Nyman at Lance.Nyman@dhs.gov Configuration Audit Pre-Test:     Step 1: TSA will review CM information to ensure it is sufficient to allow TSA to conduct a configuration audit Step 2: TSA will request with clarifications any missing information, including additional details required to conduct a configuration audit. Additional clarifications may be requested if revised information is not sufficient to conduct a configuration audit. Step 3: Offerors shall submit revised CM information along with AWT systems to the TSIF for testing Step 4: The Technical Representative(s) shall physically locate and positively identify each of the finalized CI items against the referenced drawing tree (or index drawing) and supporting BOMs and drawings which will occur before QT&E. Name plates, serial numbers, part numbers, revision numbers, and software/firmware versions shall be checked against the CM information submitted previously for each system.

Configuration Management Information: The following information is provided in detail to define the Configuration Management Information needed to be submitted during submission 1: Configuration Item (CI) List TSA initially seeks inputs from offerors to identify the most critical hardware (H/W), software (S/W), firmware (F/W) and documentation items in their system. A simple Excel file (not a PDF) with the following information is required: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Part name Part number Part revision level Drawing Number Drawing revision level Quantity For purchased CI`s, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and OEM`s part number Brief description of the CI`s primary function

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002

1. First provide a High level BOM (sometimes referred to as a Level 1 BOM) for the entire system to be evaluated. 2. Then provide sufficient assembly (Level 2) and potentially sub-assembly (Level 3) BOMs until each CI is listed. 3. Each BOM itself needs a revision level and effective date to show it is controlled by the offeror. Drawing Tree or Index Drawing A drawing tree or index drawing may be included as a function of some Computer Aided Device (CAD) packages, and may be initially used by some offerors to control and organize the overall structure of their own initial drawings in the development stage. Because it quickly shows the overall structure of the system from a high level, it is also a valuable aid to configuration management. TSA requests it initially to understand a new system under test and to guide the construction of developmental baselines. The generic drawing tree example, attachment J.4, is an adequate guideline for CM purposes at the TSIF. It is not necessary to designate the levels in the Offerors drawing, but the L1, L2, etc., levels were included to illustrate the concept and show how the drawing corresponds to the system levels listed in approved TSA baselines. Offeror Manuals & Training Materials Offerors shall supply the following information:  Operator Manual: Offeror shall provide the manual provided to operators that describes the operation of the system. Any applicable safety warnings shall be included.  Maintenance Manual: Offeror shall provide the manual that describes maintenance actions needed to maintain the system and keep it operational.

SECTION M- EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M-1 Clauses Incorporated by Reference

52.212-2 Evaluation-- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) offeror. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1. Sub-factor 1A. Sub-factor 1B. Sub-factor 1C. Sub-factor 1D. Sub-factor 1E. Factor 2. Testing & Evaluation AWT Equipment Qualification Testing & Evaluation (QT&E) AWT Equipment Operations Testing & Evaluation (OT&E) Technical Approach Past Performance Socio-Economic Considerations Price (Lowest Price Technically Acceptable)

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer`s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision) M-2 M.2.1 Contract Award BASIS FOR IDIQ CONTRACT AWARD

The Government desires that offers are identical to, or conform closely with, the terms set forth in this Solicitation. To the extent an offeror takes exception to a Government term or proposes additional or alternate terms, that offeror runs the risk the Government finds such an offer nonconforming and unacceptable. Nonconforming offers will be evaluated as posing additional risk to the Government. Offerors should consider this when readying proposals and submitting offers. All proposals will be evaluated for technical acceptability. To receive consideration for award, the proposal must be acceptable in meeting the Government`s requirement. The Government intends to make a single IDIQ contract award to the offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, represents the lowest priced, technically acceptable (LPTA) solution to the TSA. The Government will evaluate technical proposal submissions (Sub-Factors 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1E) on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. The Government will evaluate technical proposal submissions (SubFactor 1D) on an Acceptable/Neutral/Unacceptable basis. If an Offeror receives a rating of Unacceptable for any Factor or Sub-Factor, it will not be eligible for award and will not be evaluated further. If an Offeror receives a rating of Neutral, the Offeror will still be eligible for award. The Government will review price to determine the lowest priced offer from the Offerors who have submitted Acceptable proposals. M.3 Preliminary Proposal Completeness Review

123

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002
The Government will conduct a physical inventory of each offerors proposal to insure receipt of the required documents identified in Section L of the RFP. Any proposal found to be incomplete may be deemed nonresponsive by the Government and may render the offerors proposal ineligible for further evaluation for award. M.4 Evaluation Methodology

M.4.1 TESTING & EVALUATION (FACTOR 1) Reliability performance of all machines will be aggregated taking into account the sum total of all machine operational hours (uptime) and the sum total of all observed critical failures. M.4.1.1 AWT Equipment QT&E (Sub-factor 1A) The Government shall evaluate Sub-factor 1A as follows, based on the results of QT&E, including the information the offeror submits in Attachment J-9 ­ Requirements Traceability Matrix: 1. AWT Functionality Requirements Document, Attachment J.2 Requirements: QT&E shall be evaluated to assess if the offerors submitted AWT units are in accordance with the requirements(noted as shalls) in the Procurement Specification Document. M.4.1.2 AWT Equipment OT&E (Sub-factor 1B) The Government shall evaluate Sub-factor 1B as follows: 1. AWT Functionality Requirements Document, Attachment J.2 Requirements: OT&E shall be evaluated to assess if the offerors submitted AWT units are in accordance with requirements (noted as shalls) in the Procurement Specification Document. M.4.2.1, Volume I: Technical Approach (Sub-factor 1C) The Government will evaluate the Offerors Technical Approach to determine if the offeror clearly demonstrates its understanding of and ability to effectively fulfill functional and performance requirements. M.4.3.1 Volume II, Past Performance (Sub-factor 1D) The past performance evaluation will examine the extent to which the Offeror`s past performance demonstrates its capability and capacity to successfully perform the requirements of this solicitation. In assessing relevance of past performance, the Government will consider relevant contracts as those contracts that are ongoing or completed within the last three (3) years having comparable level of size, scope, and complexity to the requirements of the solicitation. The Government will evaluate Past Performance by assessing the following: 1. Evaluation of the history of developing and delivering high quality services/products in the areas described in the RFP (or areas similar to those described in the work statement) to large-scale organizations, especially those primarily Governmental in nature (such as State, local, or Federal Government entities).

124

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002
2. Evaluation of fulfillment of contract requirements and technical excellence. This includes meeting or exceeding past contract requirements, use of appropriate personnel, timeliness of offeror against the schedule of deliverables, and demonstrated technical excellence. 3. Evaluation of cost control, business relations, management of key personnel, utilization of small business and other areas as applicable. The Government reserves the right to obtain and utilize information from sources other than those identified by the offeror, such as contractor past performance information that is collected and reported in the Government`s specified automated past performance information collection systems. Lack of relevant past performance, or lack of sufficient past performance information, will result in the assignment of a neutral rating. A neutral rating indicates neither a favorable nor unfavorable evaluation for this factor. Past performance information on work for State and local Governments, private sector clients, and subcontracts that is similar to the requirements of this solicitation will be considered along with similar Federal contracts. Offerors may submit information on key management personnel, major subcontractors, work performed as part of a team or joint venture, and other previous reincarnation of its current organization. References shall only be work done by the applicable segment of the firm (division, group, and unit) and not the firm in general. If past performance as a subcontractor is submitted, the offeror shall describe only its work under the subcontract, not the entire scope of work as performed by the prime contractor. M.4.3.2 Socio-Economic Considerations (Sub-factor 1E) The Government will evaluate each Offerors socio-economic status and the proposed extent of participation of socio-economic concerns in performing the contract. Small business offerors will receive an Acceptable rating under this factor. In evaluating any required subcontracting plan, the Government shall: 1. Evaluate the plan for adequacy in accordance with FAR 19.704. 2. Evaluate the plan based on the extent to which the goals listed in Section L.4.3.3 are met. DHS Mentor-Protégé Program: Participating in the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program in accordance with HSAR Clause 3052.219-71 and providing a signed letter of mentor-protégé agreement approval from the DHS Office of Small Business and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) shall be favorably considered in the evaluation of this Factor. M.4.4 VOLUME III, PRICE PROPOSAL (FACTOR 2)

M.4.4.1 Price (Factor 2) The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. The Government will calculate the offerors evaluated price by: ˇ For all CLINs except 0002A, 0005, 0006, and 0009 ­ Multiplying the Governmentprovided estimated quantities identified in Attachment J-7 (Part A) by the proposed unit price for each corresponding Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) or SubCLIN.

125

HSTS04-11-R-CT2002
ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ For CLINs 0005, 0006­ Multiplying the Government-provided estimated labor hours per year category identified in Attachment J-7 (Part B) by the proposed labor rate for each corresponding labor category to find total estimated labor. For CLIN 0002A- Adding the price per airport as identified in Attachment J-7 (Part C) to get one total price for this CLIN. CLIN 0009 (Travel) is provided as a Government estimate and will not vary amongst offerors. Summing the extended prices above.

As stated in M.2.1 Basis for Contract Award, the TSA will make award based on LPTA. This total will be used in the LPTA comparison. M.5 EVALUATION OF COMPLETENESS SUBMISSION 1: TESTING & EVALUATION PREREQUISITE INFORMATION The Government will not consider Submission 1 under its determination of technical acceptability, as described in Section M.2, above. However, the offeror must submit in accordance with Section L.7: (1) demonstrated compliance with the safety standards; (2) Configuration Management documents; (3) Technical Information: operator, maintenance, and operator training manuals; (4) a completed and signed Bailment Agreement at Attachment J.5; (4) a completed TSIF access form at Attachment J.12; and (5) configuration and safety tracking tables . This information is a pre-requisite to QT&E. Accordingly, if the offeror does not submit this information, its systems will not progress to QT&E and beyond, and its offer will no longer be eligible for further evaluation or contract award. Additionally, the manuals provided via Submission 1 will be utilized during QT&E and OT&E to inform system operators during testing.
