Section C - Descriptions and Specifications

PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS
   1. 1.    BACKGROUND

The Department of Defense (DoD) established the Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) in 1990 to improve accessibility for people
with disabilities throughout the DoD and remove the cost of accommodations. The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), a field activity in the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), serves as the executive agent for CAP.  CAP is housed at TMA’s Office of the
Chief Information Officer (OCIO).  CAP's mission is to provide assistive technology and accommodations to ensure people with disabilities and
wounded service members have equal access to the information technology environment and opportunities in DoD and throughout the Federal
Government.  In October 2000, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology, devices, and
services to any department or agency in the Federal Government upon the request of the head of the agency. Via this authority, CAP is the
Federal Government's centrally funded accommodations program, providing assistive technology solutions at no cost to the requesting agency. Much
of CAP's success lies in the ability to provide assistive technology and reasonable accommodations to employees quickly and easily, which can
increase employment and retention of employees with disabilities.

On October 17, 2006, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology to wounded/injured service
members allowing them to retain the equipment upon separation.  CAP provides the assistive technology to the service members and coordinates the
service as outlined in the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6025.22.  Since the inception of CAP, procurement of information technology
management support services provided best administrative value to CAP as it expanded and provided over 12,000 assistive technology and
accommodation services to 68 Federal agency partners and wounded Service members in the recent Fiscal Year.

2.    OBJECTIVE

Provide Assistive Technology and Accommodation Services to Federal Employees with disabilities and Wounded Service Members.

3.    SCOPE

This award provides assistive technology to Federal Employees with Cognitive, Blind or Low Vision Impairments.


This request is to provide 10 22” Topaz XL CCTVs.

    • The Topaz XL CCTV is a more advanced version of the standard Topaz unit with a higher degree of clarity for the magnification of hard copy
      documents and other objects with small print that may be unreadable to a user with low levels of usable vision.


4. OTHER CONSTRAINTS/CONSIDERATIONS

4a. Storage and Shipping:  Items will need to be stored as CAP Inventory to be shipped to any CAP customer within the Department of Defense or
one of their partner agencies around the world as required by CAP.  Orders against CAP Inventory should be processed within 5 days of order and
customer should receive their items no later than 15 days from the order for CONUS and 25 days for OCONUS. To ensure delivery, the ship to
addresses should not be altered and need to be shipped as provided.

4b Proof of Delivery and Inventory Reports: To secure payment the vendor must provide confirmation that the inventory items are reserved for CAP
orders. Vendor should provide a spreadsheet detailing the quantity and type of items being held as inventory along with any identifying
information such as serial numbers. Tracking numbers for shipped items should be added as items are distributed to CAP Customers.  Updated
spreadsheets should be provided regularly and will be requested by CAP bi-weekly.

4c Payment: Vendors will need to confirm that all items listed in the Order Award are readily available for distribution to CAP customers before
submitting a payment request into the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF). Vendors should NOT split the Purchase Order Award per shipment.

                                                             Brand Name Justification

Topaz 22” LCD XL CCTV
The Topaz 22" XL LCD CCTV Video Magnifier yields a higher quality of detail in translation and magnification than comparable Merlin, Acrobat,
Optelec and Lifestyle CCTVs, especially when analyzing non-traditional text such as photos or charts. The XL model offers a greater level of
maneuverability than the standard Topaz CCTVs due to the integrated Glide Table and laser pointer positioning system, providing for accurate
magnification of text on irregular surfaces.
