Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA)

Supplemental Curriculum Materials – College Entrance Preparation



1.0 	INTRODUCTION

1.1. 	The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 76,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  The number of students varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide.  DoDEA’s curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools.  

1.2	DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas.  DoDEA-Americas, also known as DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers the schools in seven states and Puerto Rico, and for administrative purposes, Cuba.  DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into DoDEA-Europe and DoDEA-Pacific.  The former administers the schools in England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Bahrain.  The latter covers the schools in Korea, Japan, and for administrative purposes, Guam.  DoDEA also operates a fully accredited Virtual High School with its main office at DoDEA HQ and teaching hubs in Virginia, Germany and Korea. 

2.0 	BACKGROUND

2.1 	DoDEA provides College Entrance Preparation coursework in its high schools (grades 7-12).  The course is an academic elective designed to provide students with the skills necessary to perform successfully on postsecondary admission assessments such as The College Board’s Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).  Within the course, students will explore other components required for success in the college preparatory process, such as test-taking strategies, problem solving, critical thinking skills, and overall test structures/formats specific to the respective assessment. Students may also explore additional college entrance processes, such as essay writing, applying for financial aid, and the overall college application process.  

3.0 	SCOPE

3.1	DoDEA requires seat-based licenses for online SAT Test Preparation courseware for students in grades 7-12 to (1) engage in practice tests for the SAT including responding to practice essay questions, and (2) receive detailed explanations for both correct and incorrect answers to all questions. The courses shall include interactive activities and multimedia content to provide personalized feedback in order to provide focus for additional study and support instruction.  The courseware will be used as a curriculum supplement for DoDEA’s College Entrance Preparation course.  This course will be offered during the regular school year and within a summer program. 

3.2	All necessary orientation materials, textbooks, workbooks, lab books, or other materials 	needed for completion of the course must be included.  These may be available online or 	provided by the Contractor at no additional cost. DoDEA will provide the instructor.

3.3	DoDEA expects to award one contract for performance period for a base year and five 12-month option years, beginning on or about April 20, 2015.  DoDEA expects it will require the approximate number of online student licenses as listed below:

Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999)


(a) DoDEA Information Technology Division will evaluate all Demonstration Accounts and/or other Electronic Curricula Components to ensure compliance with the Technical Requirements of the SOW. Any component of the Contractor’s quote that fails to meet DoDEA’s information security and technology requirements will be excluded from further evaluation.  

(b) The Government will award one or more contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor(s) whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.   The descending relative order of importance of these factors is: Technical, Past Performance and Price. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. 

Factor 1 - Quality of Technical Approach: Offeror’s technical submission will be evaluated in terms of how well it demonstrates their ability to perform the requirement as set forth in the SOW and on the overall quality of the product for each course described in the SOW. 

Factor 2 - Past Performance: Offeror’s Past Performance submission will be evaluated to determine the vendor’s likelihood of success on the present requirement. Additionally, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to examine other sources of past performance information such as PPIRS or the Contracting Officer’s knowledge to determine the vendor’s likelihood of success on the present requirement.

Factor 3 – Price:  The Price quotes will be evaluated to ensure price reasonableness for the products and services being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.

(c) Options.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  

(e)	Basis for Award.  This source selection will be conducted in accordance with procedures prescribed in FAR parts 12 and 13 and as described above. 

(f)	Determining Best Value.  The Contracting Officer will use a trade-off process to determine which offer represents the best value to the Government.

Unsatisfactory (U) - Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

Government Product Accessibility Template (GPAT) for Web-based Training


Summary

       • Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each
         Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.
       • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be
         features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable
         includes additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.
       • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
         deliverable.
       • Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
         Standard.
       • Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
         applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.
