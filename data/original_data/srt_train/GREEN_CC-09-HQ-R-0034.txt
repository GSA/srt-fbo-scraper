Statement of Objectives 1. INTRODUCTION
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Integrated Mobile Employee Technology Refresh and Optimization (I-METRO) effort is seeking an experienced industry partner that will assist in its efforts to modernize its approach to providing and maintaining end user computing resources and services, align its technology investments to its business priorities, and provide a comprehensive, multi-faceted solution to improve the connectivity, collaboration, performance and overall user experience for its mobile workforce primarily bank examiners conducting on-site reviews and sustained supervision of the national banks. The OCC workforce faces a number of challenges in meeting its mission objectives. The banking industry is increasing in complexity. The consolidation of small banks into larger banks and larger banks into megabanks has reshaped the banking community. Complexity is increasing not only in the internal organizational structures of the banks but also in the products that the banks offer. This, in turn, amplifies the complexity of the risks associated with these products. Bank examiners are faced with more and more materials and data to review and analyze. While the OCC provides an array of sophisticated technologies in support of its staff and customers, the very sophistication of the OCC Information Technology (IT) portfolio presents unique challenges when it comes to extending these resources to its mobile workforce. Poor or non-existent communication services at many of its on-site engagements and computing equipment nearing the end of its useful life are two of the more significant impediments. Expectations are rising as the staff becomes increasingly more sophisticated in the knowledge and use of IT. Email and Blackberry support services, real-time collaboration facilities, asset management, and single signon authentication are no longer nice-to-have; they are essential. Whether the topic is mobility, security, accountability, data analytics and reporting, or a range of other technical concerns, the OCC's workforce wants and requires timely, accurate, and responsive service and information. 1.1. Organization Background

The Department of the Treasury is the primary Federal agency responsible for the economic and financial prosperity of the United States. The Treasury is organized into departmental offices and operating bureaus. The bureaus carry out specifically assigned mission operations. As a Treasury bureau, the OCC charters, regulates, and supervises national banks to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system that supports both the citizens and the economy of the United States. Currently, the OCC supervises approximately 1,849 institutions with national bank charters and 50 federal branches of foreign banks in the United States. The OCC has approximately 3,200 employees, 40% whom are highly mobile, in locations throughout the United States. The OCC has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., a data center in Landover, Maryland, and four district offices in Chicago, Dallas, Denver, and New York. The Office of the Ombudsman is located in Houston. The OCC also operates field offices and satellite locations in cities throughout the United States, resident examiner teams in the largest banking companies, and an examining office in London, England.

The OCC's nationwide staff of examiners conducts on-site reviews of national banks and provides sustained supervision of bank operations. The agency issues rules, legal interpretations, and corporate decisions concerning banking, bank investments, bank community development activities, and other aspects of bank operations. Attachment A provides some additional insight into the Field Examiner's Experience and examination process. 1.2. OCC Corporate Objectives

The OCC's activities are predicated on four objectives that support its mission to ensure a stable and competitive national banking system. The four objectives are: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ To ensure the safety and soundness of the national banking system; To foster competition by allowing banks to offer new products and services; To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of OCC supervision, including reducing regulatory; burden; and To ensure fair and equal access to financial services for all Americans.

Additional information regarding OCC's mission, business objectives, and other product information can be attained at www.occ.gov. 1.3. OCC Mobile Employees

National bank examiners supervise domestic and international activities of national banks and perform corporate analyses. Examiners analyze a bank's loan and investment portfolios, funds management, capital, earnings, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, and compliance with consumer banking laws, including the Community Reinvestment Act. They review the bank's internal controls, internal and external audits, and compliance with law. They also evaluate bank management's ability to identify and control risk. The examiners generally work in teams, varying in size from 3 or 4 members for community and smaller midsize banks to over 20 for the Large Banks. When on site, these teams need to communicate with each other, the banks that they are examining, and OCC data center and regional offices. Appendix A contains an overview of the field examiners' work environment. There are a number of challenges experienced by the examiners during their on-site engagements. A significant number of the assignments take place in rural communities. Examiners often find themselves in areas where there is no service available to their wireless cards. In some environments, the physical structure of the building coupled with the location of the workspace (interior conference room, basement, etc.) degrades the strength of a signal, making it difficult to connect. Once a connection is established, a portion of the field staff reports difficulty staying connected through the current VPN implementation. In addition, connection speed can vary from location to location. Response times of 5+ seconds when using wide area network-centric programs can be common. As a result, field examiners are often challenged with networkcentric applications, often preferring to work off-line or only accessing the application when in the home office. Since examiners perform many of their activities off-line, database-to-database replication is used to transfer and receive data to and from the headquarters-based databases for some of the key business systems. The examiners typically perform the replication activity over connection options ranging from phone lines to WIFI services provided by their hotels when not in their home office. When in the home office, they are connected to the office LAN typically at 100MBps with a WAN connection back to headquarters. 4 I-METRO SOO 1/7/2009

The OCC WAN consists of predominantly Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS)/Private Network Transport (PNT) telecommunications lines that support the transfer of data between Headquarters, the Data Center, four district offices, the Ombudsman's office and 96 field/bank offices. Transport protocol is TCP/IP. District and larger offices' data access speeds are 10 mbps; however, most offices are 3 mbps. About 10 smaller sites connect to the OCC network via the OCC VPN. The OCC Data Center connects to the MPLS network via two DS3s. A 100 Mbps VON Protected Ethernet backbone connects OCC Headquarters with the Data Center. The examiners also experience challenges with the hardware and software they employ on-site. The laptops are reaching the end of their productive lifecycle. Printer drivers are inconsistent. The download of patches and updates can make their equipment unavailable for substantial periods of time. Occasionally, examiners voice concerns over the amount of equipment they need to keep track of (computer, printer, scanner, RSA Token, wireless card, etc.). The snapshot below provides a high level overview of the OCC operational environment.

1.4.

OCC IT Service Delivery

The Information Technology Services Department (ITS) provides centralized information systems development, operations and maintenance, and technical infrastructure engineering and operations for the business functions of the OCC. While ITS accepts primary responsibility for continuous improvement in the provision of IT-related services, effective implementation and use of these services results from a strong partnership between the OCC business units and ITS. In support of its strategic corporate objectives, the OCC commits to the following over-arching IT goals: Provide technical leadership and IT governance for better overall IT decision­making; Deliver highest quality products and services, and assure a reliable, secure, accessible, and modern IT environment in accordance with the IT modernization vision and strategy; 5 I-METRO SOO 1/7/2009 ˇ ˇ

ˇ ˇ

Assure, establish, and maintain a competent, high-performing IT workforce; and Securely provide data of decision-making quality and business-quality data documentation to duly authorized OCC staff, whatever their location.

The OCC has initiated an effort to establish a multi-year, enterprise-wide IT Modernization Vision and Strategy (IT MV&S). The IT MV&S will emphasize both IT strategy and execution, with a direct focus on maximizing IT: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Cost efficiency; Service availability; Stakeholder satisfaction; Business impact and value; and Service quality.

The IT MV&S will serve as OCC's roadmap for: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Establishing a disciplined approach for managing IT systems that is customer-centric and ensures that near-term (0 to 2 years) and long-term (3 to 5 years) IT solutions and services are fully aligned with emerging and future business drivers, goals, and opportunities; Maximizing information sharing with internal and external stakeholders; Unifying and virtualizing technology and protecting business critical IT operations and assets; Optimizing return on investment (ROI) for new IT development investments while streamlining product development and delivery times; Identifying the IT initiatives to be executed during the period of 2010 through 2015; Aligning IT service sourcing strategies to business objectives and fully leveraging industry innovation; and Identifying crosscutting IT capabilities, target solutions, information architectures and technology standards.

Figure 1-1: The OCC IT Modernization Vision and Strategy

The IT MV&S will be completed in Q2/FY2009. The Mobile Employee requirements described herein shall be necessarily impacted by the strategies, target standards, solutions and information architectures, business opportunities, and other such drivers defined in the IT MV&S. 1.5. OCC IT Environment

Commensurate with its commitment to providing a state-of-the-art information technology (IT) environment in support of its strategic goals, the OCC invests in a range of sophisticated technologies. The OCC IT portfolio ranges from simple form-based surveys to mainframe applications to complex .NET implementations that support approximately 3,200 users, 40 percent of whom are highly mobile. The OCC is expanding into enterprise approaches in Web content management, document management, records management, knowledge management, identity management, notification services, data management and analytics, expansion of communication channels, and enterprise-wide security operations. Current initiatives include: ˇ WISDM: Implemented in FY08, WISDM is an information system and document/records manager that provides large bank examiners and OCC management the ability to collaboratively develop, securely store, search, and report on the status of their work documents and retain those documents for enterprise records management purposes; STARS: A strategic and resources system that enables bank examiners to plan, track, and schedule bank supervision activities and assign resources accordingly; CATS: A central application tracking system, presently in the planning phase, which will provide critical corporate application processing, tracking and monitoring functions currently provided by a mainframe application. CATS incorporates workflow, document management, records management, 7

and reporting components to enable automation of the receipt, processing and monitoring of corporate applications; and WEPS: A planned electronic publishing system designed to transform the traditional paper-based content management and document promulgation process into an electronic-based process with emphasis on flexible dissemination of electronic products.

The OCC is currently evaluating the advisability of expanding its use of technologies such as the Citrix infrastructure and the OpenText document management system. The OCC is also examining the use of Microsoft Office SharePoint Services 2007, to provide for single point of entry into the OCC intranet environment, and an upgrade to Office 2007, to enhance smart document development and to provide for greater integration with SharePoint 2007. Additional information on the OCC technical environment in support of the OCC workforce can be found in the attached Appendices.

Note: The OCC receives its SmartIDs (HSPD12/PIV smartcards) from the GSA's USAccess Managed Service Office. The SmartIDs have Treasury PKI certificates on them. An Identity Management Lifecycle capability and infrastructure that can manage and synchronize OCC's digital identities, directories, and those processes associated with creating, managing, and deleting user accounts and entitlements and can be utilized to provide true Single Sign On capability 12

ˇ

I-METRO SOO 1/7/2009

on all OCC workstations, web-based systems and legacy applications as well as self service password management capabilities such as the ability to reset passwords without helpdesk intervention; ˇ A Federated Identity Management (FIM) architecture and capability to improve collaboration and operational efficiencies between OCC and its partners, while still retaining the required separation of duties and systems between OCC's authentication and identification infrastructure (regardless of the underlying technologies) and partner networks.

5. CONSTRAINTS
5.1. User Authentication

OCC will be implementing HSPD-12 in the FY 09- FY12 period. HSPD-12 requires all federal agencies to adopt a standard smart card for identity verification. OCC intends to use the smart card for electronic authentication. Therefore, any new hardware proposed shall contain a built-in smart card reader capable of reading these identity cards. 5.2. Remote Management/Asset Management

The unique nature of the OCC work environment makes it increasingly difficult to manage issued computer equipment and software, especially with respect to its mobile workforce. Any managed service solution shall allow for: ˇ ˇ ˇ 5.3. Efficient and timely pushes of patches and anti-malware (anti-virus, anti-spyware) updates, especially when a user has been offline for more than one week; Capability to remotely destroy all information stored on a device in the event that the device is stolen; and Capability for physical asset, configuration and license management and tracking. Backup and Recovery

The ability to recover from a catastrophic hardware or software failure increases an information system's availability, which is an integral part of information assurance. Given the large amount of critical information the OCC's mobile workforce deals with on a typical day, any solution requires such information to be securely backed up via remote connection. Many of the applications used by the mobile workforce, such as Examiner View (EV), are designed to store information on a central server. Solutions shall ensure that work done locally by the mobile workforce is frequently synchronized with the central server. In addition, the information system shall be configured to reduce the time to recover information that is backed up in the event it is needed. 5.4. Personal Area Network

The OCC's mobile workforce often has a need to share files locally in Personal Area Networks. Although information that is locally stored or transmitted in the OCC network is encrypted, information transferred informally between users may not be. Today, this requirement is primarily handled via thumb drive transfers. Therefore, any optimized solution shall address the issue of providing adequate and convenient encryption for transfers of documents. Appropriate encryption mechanisms can be found in FIPS 140-2. I-METRO SOO 1/7/2009 13

5.5. Second Hard Drive The OCC requires a second hard drive that is compatible with any new laptops the Contractor deploys as a part of the lifecycle hardware management process. The second hard drive will be an optional feature that can be requested by employees who are on extended travel. The second hard drive will be used to provide employees with a non-mission related operating environment which is isolated from any OCC networks, applications, and data. The contractor shall be able to support any second hard drive needs that arise for OCC employees. The second hard drive shall meet the following requirements: 1) Come preloaded with a base image of the latest OCC-approved operating system. The OCC will provide the license and the image. a. Come preconfigured with an OCC-approved and provided full disk encryption solution. b. Come preconfigured with OCC-approved and provided solutions for Anti Virus, Firewall, and Host Based Intrusion Detection/Prevention software. 2) Work in concert with device tracking and asset management software requested as part of Lifecycle Hardware Management efforts. As a part of the asset management efforts, the Contractor shall ensure that the hard drives are properly tagged. 3) Provide accurate inventory information related to the number of second hard drives issued. 4) Present the user with an OCC warning banner. 5.6. Quality Management

The OCC is committed to delivering quality products and services that are compliant with industryrecognized standards such as ISO 9001:2000, ITIL and CMMI. Any proposed solution shall include a demonstrated capability to consistently meet or exceed customer requirements and place customer satisfaction as a key component. 5.7. ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Operational Controls Incident Reception and Documentation (Tier 1) will be maintained by a separate contractor that will provide notification of incident requirements; Equipment moves and relocations will be performed by others; Network infrastructure will be provided, monitored and administered by others; Production, administration, maintenance and other activities that may degrade the performance of network environments, operating systems, databases and applications shall be performed outside of business hours. Subject Matter Experts

The Contractor shall work with others as defined in the following controls:

5.8.

In light of the specialization and high level of expertise of services typically required, the OCC is looking for Offerors to demonstrate the ability to attract, develop, motivate, organize, and retain the personnel needed to perform the services required by the contract. 5.9. Applicable Documents

APPENDIX A: Field Examiner Experience
The following are general observations about the Field Examiner experience. Individual situations and experiences may vary greatly within the population of approximately 2,000 field examiners. Exam Conditions  Community Bank Environment  Onsite at bank ­ Depends on the availability of space for the number of examiners on a team; most often in a Board Room or meeting space and can occasionally be in open areas such as a lunch room.  Short-Term focus ­ Typical onsite duration for an exam is 2 weeks.  Office Time - 1-2 weeks per quarter in the office to do periodic monitoring.  Team Size ­ For onsite activities, 4 to 8 examiners on average.  Mid-Size Bank Environment  Resident at Bank for blocks of time ­ The Examiner-in-Charge (EIC) is assigned to only one bank. They may or may not have permanent space assigned by the bank.  Average onsite for an exam is 4 weeks and there will be multiple activities at these banks in any given year.  Office time ­ The EIC typically splits their time between the bank and an OCC field office. Time spent in one or the other location varies greatly.  Team Size ­ Varies greatly, and multiple exam teams may be working in these banks at one time.  Large Bank Environment  Resident at Bank ­ These banks typically have an EIC and staff members who are assigned to just that bank. They will work in permanent bank-provided space.  Team Concept ­ Large Banks also has "teams" of examiners who split their time among 3 or 4 banks. These examiners use OCC leased facilities as their office space.  These banks have activities taking place throughout the supervisory cycle.  Office Time ­ Varies greatly and can range from none to significant amounts.  Team Size ­ Varies greatly, and multiple exam teams can be working in these banks at one time.

Connections  Phone Line ­ In the community bank environment, phone lines temporarily installed into the banks for connection to OCC network.  Verizon or ATT Wireless Card ­ Every Mid-Size/Community Bank Examiner has either a Verizon or an ATT Wireless Card. Connections and speed tends to be better in the larger metropolitan areas, degrading to spotty or non-existent in more remote locations.  Wi-Fi ­ Occasional availability in examiners hotel locations.

Challenges  Ability to Connect ­ A significant portion of the field examiners travel to smaller, rural communities to work in the banks where wireless communications are limited. The physical structure and working location inside of the building (interior conference room, basement, etc.) can also cause connectivity challenges.  Reliability of Connection ­ A small percentage have reported difficulty staying connected through the VPN access software/hardware.  Speed of Connection ­ Connection speed varies significantly from location to location. Response times of 5+ seconds when using network-centric programs can cause challenges for the workforce.  HP 460 Printer ­ Sharing of printers between examiners have led to multiple installs of drivers when on site.  Other Equipment Issues ­ Examiners have raised concerns over the amount of equipment needed to perform their exams (computer, printer, scanner, RSA Token, wireless card, etc.)

APPENDIX D: Key Business Applications on the Desktop/Laptop
Application Solution Name National Credit Tool Short Description

Used in a disconnected environment to analyze, sample, and report on the contents of a bank's loan trial balance. NCT captures summary information from reviews and generates summary reports of review results, which are replicated through SIS ­ EV to the SIS database.

Supervisory Information System - Examiner View

Assists bank examiners in preparing, conducting, and analyzing examinations of financial institutions. The application is the primary tool to analyze community and mid-size banks. SIS - EV is primarily used in a disconnected environment, and examiners use replication to transfer and receive data for the SIS database.

Supervisory Information System - National Resource Planning Tool

Used by Community, Midsize, Large Bank, and MDPS resource coordinators to plan external work resources. Specifically, this application is used to request examiner support and assign examiners to support others. "External" requests refer to work that is not funded by one's own office or budget code. Risked Based Capital (RBC) is a model that supports the bankers in completing schedule RCR of the Call Report. It also allows the examiners to analyze risk to the bank's capital structure and to calculate the regulatory limitations based on "what if" scenarios. The Workflow and Information Systems and Document Management (WISDM) will automate the Large Bank (LB) examination workflow process while providing a central document repository with document and records management capabilities. A document management and electronic records management information system will improve the quality, consistency, and timeliness of the supervisory reports; ensures appropriate approvals, distributions, and records management; and provides information/report aggregation capabilities. APRWIN is a tool for calculating loans' annual percentage rates and reimbursement adjustments. The program is intended to comport with accuracy requirements of Regulation Z (12 CFR 226). Calculations are based on the actuarial method as contained in Appendix J (of the regulation) and the formulas contained in Appendix D (of the regulation) to the regulation. The application provides a tool for the calculation of annual percentage yields pursuant to the Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) and it's implementing regulation (Regulation DD, 12 CFR 230). E-Time is the Agency's electronic time and attendance reporting system. E-TIME is an online time, attendance, and activity reporting system that seeks to improve the timeliness and accuracy of the time and attendance reporting system(s) and processes of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). It provides functionality and features to enable OCC's 2,800 geographically dispersed employees to report their leave and work activities using a single automated paperless system, and successfully replaced the former existing paper-based leave and time reporting processes and supporting systems. It is comprised of a core time and attendance application, as well as 3 supplemental applications that allow for off-line time and attendance capabilities, automated processing of leave, and improved administrative functionality.

Attachment 5- Subcontracting Plan Outline

  Department of the Treasury Small, HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned Small, Veteran-Owned Small, & Service Disabled Veteran-Owned
                                               Small Business Concerns Subcontracting Plan Outline

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of Public Law 95-507 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subparts 19.7.  It is
intended to be a guideline.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan which is more extensive. If you need assistance to locate
small business sources, contact the Director, Office of Small Business Development at (202) 622-0530 or the bureau Small Business Specialist,
Ms. Deirdre Eischens, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, at (202) 874-5442. Please note that the Department of the Treasury has
subcontracting goals of  41 % for small business,  3 % for HUBZone Small Business,  5 % for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB),   5 % for Women-
Owned Small Business (WOSB), and  3 % for Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) for fiscal year  2008 . For this procurement,
the Department of the Treasury expects all proposed subcontracting plans to contain the above goals, at a minimum.  Although there is no
statutory goal for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) concerns, a VOSB goal must be proposed in accordance with FAR 19.7 and should represent
the offeror’s best effort to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for VOSBs.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of
the total available subcontracting dollars.

Identification Data:
  Company Name:                                                                      
  Address:                                                                                   
  Date Prepared:                  Solicitation Number:

  Place of Performance:                                                                            

1. TYPE OF PLAN: (Check only one).
|        |INDIVIDUAL PLAN: In this type of plan, all elements are developed specifically for this contract and are applicable for |
|        |the full term of this contract.                                                                                         |
|        |MASTER PLAN: In this type of plan, goals are separately developed for this contract in an individual plan; all other    |
|        |elements are standard. The master plan must be approved once every three (3) years. Once incorporated into a contract   |
|        |with specific goals, it is valid for the life of the contract.                                                          |
|        |COMMERCIAL PLAN: This type of plan is used when the contractor sells products and services customarily used for         |
|        |non-government purposes. Plans and goals are negotiated with the initial agency on a company-wide basis rather than for |
|        |individual contracts. The plan is effective only during year approved. The contractor must provide a copy of the initial|
|        |agency approval, and must submit an annual Summary Subcontracting Report (SSR) in the electronic Subcontracting         |
|        |Reporting System (eSRS) to Treasury with a breakout of subcontracting prorated for Treasury (with a further bureau      |
|        |breakout, if possible).                                                                                                 |

year and each option year.  (Please note that the goals for HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business,
veteran-owned small business, and service disabled veteran-owned small business concerns are sub-sets of the small business goal).   Express all
dollar goals as a percentage of total planned subcontracting dollars.   Zero percentage/dollar goals are NOT ACCEPTABLE and will not be
approved.

5. CLAUSE INCLUSION AND FLOWDOWN
FAR 19.704(a)(9) requires that your company provide assurances that it will include the clause at FAR 52.219-8, “Utilization of Small Business
Concerns,” in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities.  FAR 52.219-9(d)(9) also requires that your company agrees in
this plan that it will require all subcontractors, except small business concerns, that receive subcontracts in excess of $550,000 ($1,000,000
for construction) to adopt a plan that complies with the requirements of FAR 52.219-9, “Small Business Subcontracting Plan.”
                                                                                        [Insert company name] agrees that the clause will be
included and that the plans will be reviewed against the minimum requirements for such plans. The acceptability of percentage goals for small,
HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, veteran-owned small, and service disabled veteran-owned small business concerns must be
determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the supplies and services involved, the availability of potential small, HUBZone small, small
disadvantaged, women-owned small, veteran-owned small, and service disabled veteran-owned small business subcontractors and prior experience.
Once the plans are negotiated, approved, and implemented, the plans must be monitored through the submission of periodic reports, including the
Individual Subcontracting Report and the Summary Subcontracting Report submitted through the electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).

6. REPORTING AND COOPERATION
FAR 19.704(a)(10) requires that your company (1) cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required, (2) submit periodic reports which show
compliance with the subcontracting plan; (3) submit Individual Subcontracting Report and Summary Subcontracting Report through the electronic
Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS); and (4) ensure that subcontractors agree to submit the Individual Subcontracting Report and the Summary
Subcontracting Report through the electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  The cognizant Contracting Officer of the Treasury bureau
awarding the contract must approve the reports through the eSRS system.  The reports  must be submitted electronically through the eSRS system
within 30 days after the close of each calendar period. That is:
|Calendar Period |Report Due                       |Date Due |Send Report Through the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System  |
|                |                                 |         |(eSRS) to:                                                          |

9. DESCRIPTION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT

Maximum practicable utilization of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, veteran-owned small, and service disabled
veteran-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic
benefits. When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and
15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F) directs that the contractor must pay liquidated damages. In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort
to achieve the small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, veteran-owned small, and service disabled veteran-owned small
business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take. These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior
to approval of the plan.

OCC end user computing equipment is nearing the end of its productive life. Rather than initiating a traditional hardware replacement acquisition, the OCC is seeking an innovative approach to providing its users the technology and services necessary to do their jobs. The purpose of this work request is to establish a pilot program that deploys a comprehensive, managed services approach to providing technologically current end user computing devices, peripherals and supporting services for the OCC Southern District locations indicated in Figure 1-1 with the staff complements listed in Figure 1-2. The resulting program will effectively transition the equipment acquisition, provisioning, deployment, configuration management, asset management, maintenance, equipment disposal and image management responsibilities from other contractors and the Government to the Contractor.

Requirements
The Offeror shall respond to the following: 1. Describe its approach to rapidly providing the OCC workforce with office automation equipment that leverages currently available technology, accounts for the different needs of certain sets of users, and prevents equipment from extending beyond industry standard timeframes for end-of-life throughout the life of the contract (assume a 5-year period of performance). 2. Prepare a schedule that addresses all activities and associated deliverables required for this scenario. Identify which labor categories including skill sets, associated experience and staffing levels (level of effort) are required to execute each task. 3. Describe any engineering challenges and significant risks and how they will be managed or mitigated. 4. Discuss the leading practices, business drivers and associated metrics that are key to achieving the objectives of this scenario. 5. Discuss any training requirements that may emerge due to the pilot deployment and how they will be met. 6. Prepare a detailed cost proposal that identifies detailed specifications and cost per unit for each hardware kit specified in Attachment 1 as well as a per seat cost for the array of supporting services proposed to meet the requirements of this scenario. It is envisioned that the Contractor shall provide technology appropriate to the timeframe in which the contract is awarded.

Identity Management and Access Control Requirements
The OCC manages and oversees networks, systems, and mission critical applications that rely on an Identity Management and Access Control (IdAM) framework that has evolved over to time to incorporate different automated and manual IdAM technologies and processes. Since the OCC is making its systems and information more readily available to its mobile workforce and regulatory partners and, at the same time, is trying to meet mandatory requirements for HSPD-12 compliance, its existing IdAM framework cannot deliver the more responsive, more secure, more integrated, and more transparent IT services being demanded from the Information Technology Services (ITS) division. Current State Currently the OCC primarily relies on its directory services for its IdAM requirements. The current Microsoft Active Directory (AD) implementation is used as the authoritative authentication, identification and authorization repository for all of OCC. The existing AD architecture has been extended to roughly 50% of all OCC systems and 100% of all user accounts. While AD serves OCC well by providing the repositories for identities and credentials, and can perform some identity verification functions, it lacks the integrated architecture and framework to provide capabilities such as workflow, role management, and policy management. This has, in turn, resulted in a number of security and compliance challenges that OCC cannot adequately meet without dedicated IdAM engineering experience, best in class tools, governance, and education.

Risk Proposition GAO and the Department of the Treasury, including the Inspector General's Office, have identified a number of business and security risks associated with the lack of a fully integrated and modernized IdAM architecture. (Sources: GAO-06-543R, GAO-07-364, GAO-08-211, GAO-07-364, GAO-07-364, GAO-08-211, TIGTA 2007-20-161, as well as a sampling of HSPD-12 & IdAM deployments across the Treasury's various bureaus. Business Value and Security Drivers for IdAM Administrative Efficiencies ­ the increase in internal and external users and their associated roles and identities has stretched OCC's technical, administrative and engineering resources to their limit. The right IdAM solution will allow OCC to simplify administration, allow for the reuse of various IdAM attributes, and ultimately reduce administrative and engineering costs. Security Efficiencies ­ the need for a single, integrated and authoritative access control infrastructure is critical if OCC is to provide agile and responsive security services to its internal and external users. Additionally OCC, as well as the rest of the Department, are required to meet a broad spectrum of regulatory and compliance requirements associated with FISMA, various OMB circulars, and HSPD-12, which have resulted in a number of audit findings. IdAM is built upon, and will provide OCC, the needed infrastructure, governance, and administrative efficiencies needed to achieve full audit and regulatory compliance. However, and more importantly, IdAM bolsters access control and provides the transparency needed to show who has access to what, why they were given that access, who approved the access, and what they accessed. Productivity & Agility ­ the need for doing more with less, coupled with ever growing demands on IT to rapidly meet the needs of the business, not to mention regulatory and compliance pressures, such as HSPD-12, require OCC to be able to more flexible and agile in how identities are created, managed, and controlled while not slowing down business initiatives. Unified Architecture & Governance ­ the need for a single, consistent and unified architecture and governance process for IdAM will allow for the understanding, prioritizing and communicating the numerous business and regulatory needs from OCC's business units to IT. The ability to standup IdAM processes that are tied to a unified architecture and governance process will allow OCC to formally implement the robust control environment that will authorize the creation of the needed policies and standards, access model, procedures, relevant project plans, key performance metrics, and the capital cost controls required for investment in OCC's new IdAM toolset. IdAM Program Goals 1. Develop an IdAM program that ensures security of OCC assets and resources; 2. Establish a OCC-wide IdAM governance structure that coordinates processes and policies and ensures compliance;

3. Increase assurance level of employer and contractor identities in accordance with federal mandates; 4. Develop a secure IdAM infrastructure that allows appropriate access to OCC buildings and systems; and 5. Enable security audits of employee and contractor access to OCC resources. Requirements The Offeror shall respond to the following: 1. Describe its approach to establishing a formal IdAM program for the OCC that provides the technical, regulatory, and operational capabilities needed to administer, authorize, authenticate, and audit the full lifecycle of a user's identity and access permissions. 2. Prepare a sample, actionable roadmap with associated technologies that demonstrates the approach to meet the OCC's security and compliance requirements in a cost-effective, business-focused manner. 3. Describe any engineering challenges and significant risks and how they will be managed or mitigated. 4. Discuss the leading practices, business drivers and associated metrics that are key to achieving the objectives of this scenario. 5. Prepare a detailed cost proposal that identifies the skill mix, rates, hours, and the overall projected cost for a Federal agency needing to build, implement and manage a HSPD-12 and OMB compliant IdAM best practice program.
