DCMA requires a software solution that synchronizes data sources from Oracle and SQL into SharePoint lists. Layer2 Business Data List Connector (BDLC) software provides a powerful mechanism for surfacing external data through lists, and drastically improves platform stability and development cycles. Layer2 BDLC software will reduce development overhead for querying external data sources, and enable the use of out of box SharePoint features for surfacing this information. The Layer2 BDLC software was the only software identified to meet all requirements. This is a new contracting action and the total dollar value of this contract is estimated to be $40,498.86. Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is: X 10 U.S.C. 2304(c )(1) Â­ Available from only one or a limited number of sources The ITCSO Design Team conducted market research and has determined that the Layer2 Business Data List Connector software is the only software that can effectively meet their analysis needs. Of all software reviewed, Layer2 offered the only software that seamlessly integrates with SharePoint for external data synchronization without extended development or configuration. The Layer2 Business Data List Connector enables line of business data integration and synchronization with SharePoint lists. Out of box SharePoint data synchronizations do not allow workflow, tasks, and business actions to be configured, however, the BDLC enable this capability for developers and administrators. Layer2 offered direct synchronization between SharePoint lists and Oracle, SQL, FileMaker, and other external data source. Layer2 software met the requirement of code-free write-back support to external data via .NET or OLEDB including full create, update, and delete. Layer2 provides the ability to query Microsoft Exchange, Outlook, or Active Directory for objects to surface in SharePoint lists and web parts. Layer2 enables RSS feeds for external data through the SharePoint object model without code. Layer2 provides the capability to leverage out of box web parts to surface list data. Layer2 also has other unique capabilities including the ability define list templates based upon database select statements without code. Technical Certification: I certify that the data and information forming the basis for this justification and approval, as presented above, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

When making a Best Value Determination the Contracting Officer will consider price as an equal factor to all other non-priced factors when combined.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

performed on a Federal Government contract(s). PPIRS is a web-enabled, government-wide application that collects quantifiable and narrative contractor past performance information from all Federal contracting agencies and provides a contractor's previous performance based on Federal Stock Class (FSC) or Product Service Code (PSC).
