I. OVERVIEW

A. Agency Information- The U. S. Railroad Retirement Board (“RRB”) is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and survivor
      benefits program for railroad employees and their families. The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and 1974. Its
      benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System. The Railroad Retirement System is unique inasmuch as it is
      the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry. The RRB also administers the Railroad Unemployment
      Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees. The RRB’s headquarters is located in Chicago,
      Illinois.


B. Performance-based Service Contracting Solicitation/Contract- This solicitation has been developed in response to the Office of Federal
      Procurement Policy (OFPP) policy to increase the use of performance-based contracting methods in the acquisition of services. Performance-
      based contracting aims to improve the value of contracting services by emphasizing objective, measurable mission-related outputs rather
      than how the work is performed or broad and imprecise statement of work. It requires objective, measurable performance requirements and
      quality standards in developing statements of work, selecting contractors, determining contract type and incentives, and performing
      contract administration.

C. Objective
      The RRB is seeking a contractor that can provide IT Customer Support services as specified in section III below for the U.S. Railroad
      Retirement headquarters facility in Chicago, IL.

D. Post Award Conference - In order to codify any procedural issues and implement contract performance start up, a post award conference will be
      held at the RRB Headquarters Facility, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60611-2092 or via a conference call. The contractor must
      attend this conference and be prepared to discuss the initial phase-in-plan. The contractor will be responsible for all costs related to
      attending this conference. It is anticipated that this conference will be held within 5 workdays after contract award.

III. STATEMENT OF WORK

  A. Introduction

      The Railroad Retirement Board seeks to acquire support for its helpdesk and desktop operations at the agency’s headquarters facility
      located at 844 N. Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois.

  B.  Background

      The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is a Federal agency headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.  In addition to its headquarters location the
      agency has 54 field offices located across the nation. The RRB employs just over 900 employees, with approximately 600 of the employees
      located at the headquarters facility, and the remaining workforce is distributed in groupings of 2-12 employees at each of the field
      offices.

      The RRB currently has a helpdesk and desktop support operation employed with Federal employees. The helpdesk work unit has two Federal
      employees, and the desktop support unit has three Federal employees. The helpdesk unit supports all RRB employees. The desktop support unit
      only supports headquarters employees. Desktop support for the field offices is accomplished through a third-party contractor support.

      A modernization effort has recently been completed establishing a robust, flexible, reliable, user-friendly computing infrastructure. This
      effort focused on improving the desktop, office automation, wide area network (WAN), cyber security, and communications. The Microsoft
      Windows Operating System is used as standard desktop configurations for processing in a Windows and IBM mainframe system environment. The
      Microsoft Office suite of office automation software has been implemented which supports word processing, spreadsheets, presentations,
      database management, internet access, and e-mail.

  C. Scope

      The RRB’s objective is to acquire information technology support services from a contractor to conduct training to improve the capabilities
      of the existing Federal customer support staff, develop procedures to implement industry best practices in customer support and to augment
      the existing Federal workforce to accomplish the IT support mission in the following areas:

      • Help desk operation;
      • Desktop support:

      Approximately 2900 helpdesk service calls were processed in a recent 12-month period. The number of service calls, however, cannot be
      accurately predicted and there is no assurance of steady work. The anticipated services require a diversity of skills suitable to a variety
      of information technology environments in support of a variety of functional areas.  Of the 2900 service calls, approximately 780
      originated from the RRB field offices.


      The Help Desk is responsible for taking all service/trouble calls from the RRB’s Headquarters in Chicago and the 54 RRB remote sites. Calls
      that originate from the RRB remote offices are entered in the ticket management system and forwarded to a third party contractor. Feedback
      is provided and work is performed by various business partners. Notice of repair is provided by the third party contractor to the Help Desk
      and the ticket is closed.

      1.   Required Basic IT Customer Support Services


         The contractor shall perform the helpdesk and desktop support services as required per sections III.G and III.H, using industry best
         practices, integrating new methodologies and enhancements whenever possible.  Contractor personnel will work side-by-side with existing

             skill assessment for determining remaining knowledge gaps of RRB staff.

           2. Weekly Training
             The Contractor shall provide a training program based on the recommendations of the initial assessment to the COTR. The training

              recommendations for formal training  provided by third-party providers.

      2.    Place of Performance

  the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor
  can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The
  Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does

  (20) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
    (a) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
    contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s
    reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is
    required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR
    database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this
    contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (b)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
    contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding notation
    and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of
    one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of
    Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.
    The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
         (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (20)(b)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement
         at paragraph (20)(b)(i)(c) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed notation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR
         information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect
         information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.


    (c) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
    assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
    CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate
    recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment”
    paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (d) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
    http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

      (i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (6)(d)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or
      designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled “Trade Agreements.”
      (ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.

|______________              |_________________                 |


                                                               [List as necessary]

      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO
      GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy
      American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting
      Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the
      requirements of the solicitation.
  (8) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
  simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
  principals—
    (a) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
    Federal agency;
    (b) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
    for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
    government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
    embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal
    criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (c) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
    these offenses enumerated in paragraph (8)(b) of this clause; and
    (d) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
    exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
        determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
        liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
        payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
        of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court
        review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
        under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further
        appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to
        contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent
        tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the
        taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
        full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
        payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
        11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (9) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in

      of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
  (10) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For

      traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course
      of normal business operations;
      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
      4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
      (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as

     does not certify that—
      (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
      subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business
      operations;
      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-

      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (11)(a) or (11)(b) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
      Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (11)(a) or
      (11)(b) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (11)(c)(i) of this clause.
  (12) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this

               by any Federal agency;

               (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
                  (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not
                  finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the
                  liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
                  (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax
                  liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is
                  precluded.
                (2) Examples.
                  (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
                  Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the
                  taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal
                  rights.
                  (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued
                  a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien
                  filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing,
                  the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest
                  the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review,
                  this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
                  (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments
                  and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently
                  required to make full payment.
                  (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is
                  stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
            (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for
            default by any Federal agency.
            (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary
            management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or
            business segment; and similar positions).

            This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False,
            Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States
            Code.

         (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror
         learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
         (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an
         award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s
         responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the
         Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
         (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good
         faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to
         exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
         (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when
         making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies
         available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

        filed or amended by paragraph (d) of this clause shall be subject to civil penalties as provided for by 31 U.S.C. 1352. An imposition of

        retained in the subcontract file of the awarding Contractor.

             interest, or engage in any activity, which conflicts substantially, or appears
             to conflict substantially, with the offeror’s duties under this contract.  The
             offeror further agrees that the RRB shall have the exclusive right to
             determine whether such a conflict of interest exists, and whether it is
             substantial.  Failure of the offeror to adhere to this provision will, at the
             discretion of the RRB, result in the immediate termination of the contract
             without any further liability of the RRB.

        18.     Post-award meeting

                  this conference and be prepared to discuss the requirements of the contract.
                  The Contractor will be responsible for all costs related to attending this
                  meeting.

        19.     Employment Eligibility Verification (JAN 2009) FAR 52.222-54
           (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--


               "Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item" --


                (1) Means any item of supply that is --


                 (i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at 2.101);

                (2) Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.

   receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
   satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
      (1)Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office

      (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received by the Government office designated in the solicitation after
      the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the
      Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and -
           (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point
           of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers;
           or
           (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers
           and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

        (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be

      on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
      personnel.

      office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude
      amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed
      to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
      (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
      to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile
      received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning
      facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by  an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for
      receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.


   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without
   discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical
   standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
   The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive
   informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
   limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government

                    reliability as well as the ability to perform in a timely manner, and

                e. Business relations, which includes the offeror’s ability to cooperate with the
                   client on contractual issues and to respond to business inquiries in an
                   effective manner.

           4.  Value-added characteristics.
           Offerors shall explain any organizational or technical characteristics they
           provide that would be advantageous to the RRB. This could include (but not
           necessarily be limited to) such things as additional resources available
           through a corporate support structure or from another source, tools that would
           enable them to understand the RRB’s situation in greater detail and provide
           the best resultant services to support the RRB as previously described, etc.

VI.   EVALUATION AND AWARD
     The RRB will evaluate proposals in accordance with the following FAR Clause and
     as specified below:

   A. Evaluation- Commerical Items (JAN 1999) FAR 52.212-2
     (1) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the
     solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The
        following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

                a. Business Proposal Evaluation

           1. The total evaluated price (TEP) for each offeror shall be sum of the the total annual firm-fixed price offered for Basic IT
               Customer Support services (CLINs 001AA - 001AE listed in Section II.B.) for the initial year plus four one year option periods
               added to the sum of the optional services RWH hourly rates multiplied by an evaluative number of 320 hours/year for each optional
               service (CLINs 002AA, 002AB and 002AC and their subCLINs) over the entire term of the contract.


               Example:
               001AA (Annual Amount)  + 001AB (Annual Amount)  + 001AC (Annual Amount)  + 001AD (Annual Amount) + 001AE (Annual Amount)  +
               [(002AA01(RWH) +002AA02(RWH) + 002AA03(RWH) + 002AA04(RWH) + 002AA05(RWH)) x 320] + [(002AB01(RWH) + 002AB02(RWH) + 002AB03(RWH) +
               002AB04(RWH) + 002AB05(RWH)) x 320] + [(002AC01(RWH) + 002AC02(RWH) + 002AC03(RWH) + 002AC04(RWH) + 002AC05(RWH)) x 320] = TEP


           2.   Calculation of the “price score” (100 possible points) shall be
               computed by multiplying the maximum point score available by a fraction representing the ratio of the lowest total evaluated price
               of all technically acceptable offers received by the Board to the total evaluated price of the offer being evaluated.


                b. Technical Proposal Evaluation


           1.    Calculation of the “technical score” will be accomplished by adding all
                  points earned through objective evaluation of each proposal.


           2.    The technical factors are listed below in descending order of
                  importance:

               a. Contractor Management Plan  (90 possible points).
                 The services and staffing plan, training plan and quality control plan will be evaluated. See Section V.C.1.

               b.  Experience, Qualifications & Expertise of Proposed Staff (50 possible points).  Resumes of the proposed individuals will be
                 evaluated to identify and score specific years of experience, relevant degrees and certifications, etc. See Section V.C.2.

               c.  Past Performance (50 possible points).
                 The RRB will contact at least three clients for which similar tasks have been performed. See Section V.C.3. The following
                 performance characteristics will be evaluated:

  1.   Direct applicability of the referenced services to the
                                            RRB’s requested services,
                                      2.   Customer satisfaction, which includes satisfaction of end
                        users with the offeror’s service,
                    3.   Quality of service, which includes the offeror’s compliance
                           with contract requirements.
                                      4.   Timeliness of performance, which includes the offeror’s
                                            reliability as well as the ability to meet contractually-
                                            established deadlines, and
                    5.   Business relations, which includes the offeror’s ability to
                          cooperate with the client on contractual issues and to
                          respond to business inquiries in an effective manner.


               d. Value-added characteristics (10 possible points)
                See Section V.C.4. The RRB will evaluate any organizational
       or technical characteristics that would be advantageous to the
       agency. This could include (but not necessarily be limited to)
       such things as additional resources available through a
       corporate support structure or from another source, tools that
                 would enable them to understand the RRB’s situation in greater detail and provide the best resultant services to support the RRB
                 as previously described, etc.

      c.    Evaluation Formula
                     The following formula will be used as a guide by the RRB in
       determining which offer is most advantageous to the RRB.

               Total Proposal Score = (Technical Score) + (Price Score)

            For purposes of this evaluation, the relative weighting of technical
            factors to price factors shall be 2:1.

      (2) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the
      basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation
      of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).


      (3) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for
      acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified
      expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless
      a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.


     B.  Evaluation of Options (July 1990)-Far 52.217-5
      Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interest, the Government will evaluate
      offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options
      will not obligate the Government to  exercise the option(s).

     C.  General
      1.  To be considered responsive to this requirement, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified.  Offerors whose
        proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at the RRB’s discretion, to remedy the deficiency by submitting
        additional clarifying or supplemental information.


      2.  Proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation instructions.  Proposals which are so deficient in
        these areas as to not warrant further consideration will be rejected and the offeror will be so notified.

      3. Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response.  Accordingly, the objective of this
        technical evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work.


      4.  The Government will evaluate the proposals received and award a
           contract, subject to the availability of funds, to the responsible offeror whose
           offer conforming to the solicitation is the Best Value to the Government, price
         and other factors (including Contractor Management plan, Expertise and Qualifications of proposed staff, past performance, and value-
        added characteristics) considered.

                                           NOTIFICATION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS


Background

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors,
established a policy for all Federal agencies to create and use a government-wide secure and reliable form of identification for their Federal
employees and contractors. This policy is intended to ensure a more complete, reliable, and trusted identification of individuals and for
controlling the access of Federal employees and contractors to Federal physical facilities and information systems.

This notification is issued to applicants for employee and certain contractor positions with the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) to describe the
personal identity verification policies of this agency.


Applicant Identification Responsibilities

As an applicant for a position as an employee or contractor with the RRB, you are required to do the following in order to complete your
application process:
    • Appear in person before the appropriate RRB official and present two forms of identity source documents to prove your claimed identity.
      The identity source documents must be in original form and come from the list of acceptable documents shown below. At least one document
      shall be a valid State or Federal government issued picture identification (ID).
    • Complete and bring with you the enclosed Standard Form (SF) 85, OPM Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, or an equivalent form to
      provide the required background information; so that a background check can be completed, unless one was previously done, remains on file,
      and can be referenced. (For additional copies of this form go to http://www.opm.gov/forms.)
    • Submit to having your picture and fingerprints taken.

Once a background check has been completed, and no derogatory information is developed, you will be required to:
    • Appear in person to the authorized RRB official to collect your PIV (Personal Identity Verification) Card. At that time, you will again be
      required to present a state or Federal government picture identity source document to verify that you are the same individual as the one
      who applied for the employee or contractor position and submitted the identity information required under this policy.
    • Accept the PIV Card by signing for the card and acknowledging the related responsibilities.


Responsibilities of Holding a PIV Card

When you are issued a PIV Card, you have the following responsibilities regarding its care and protection. You will be asked to sign a statement
acknowledging your responsibilities. Some of the important responsibilities are:


    • You are required to protect your PIV Card from loss or theft. However, in the event that your card is lost or stolen, you must report the
      loss within 24 hours of noting its disappearance.
    • You agree that you will not attempt to clone, modify, or obtain data from any PIV Card.
    • You agree that you will not assist others in gaining unauthorized access to Federal facilities or information.


Protection of Applicant Information

The following information provided by you will be used as part of the process of identity proofing, registration/enrollment, conducting a
background investigation, and issuance of a PIV Card:
    • Applicant’s full name;
    • Date and place of birth;
    • Identity source documents; and
    • Other relevant information useful for proving the claimed identity of the applicant.

This information will be stored in secure electronic media or in locked files. Access to the records is limited to those individuals who have a
need to know the information in order to perform official functions under the PIV issuance process.


Notification of Results of Identity Proofing

If, as a result of the identity proofing process, you are deemed ineligible to be appointed to the position for which you applied and to be
issued an official RRB identity document, you will be notified in writing of the identity proofing results. You will also be notified at that
time of any additional rights you have under the RRB’s identity proofing processes.


Rights If PIV Card Is Not Approved for You

If you are denied a PIV Card, you have the right to appeal that decision Your appeal should start with a request to the Director of Human
Resources to review your case. [Note: If the position/contract you seek is in the Office of Inspector General (OIG), you should appeal to the
Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG.] Your request must be made within five workdays of receiving notification of the
denial, and should specify the basis for your belief that the decision to deny you a PIV Card was incorrect. If you are not satisfied with the
decision at this stage, you may make a further appeal to the Director of Administration [or the Inspector General in the case of a
position/contract in the OIG] within five workdays of receiving the decision at the initial stage of the appeal.


Correcting Incorrect Information

You have the right to present evidence to correct any information that you believe to be incorrect that is obtained about you as a result of the
PIV Card identity proofing, registration/enrollment, and issuance. Such evidence should be presented to the Director of Human Resources [or the
Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG for a position/contract in the OIG] as soon as you become aware of a decision being
made about you based on the incorrect information. A PIV Applicant Representative is available to assist you in removing incorrect


information from your records. The name of your PIV Applicant Representative is Pamela Martin-Tate She can be reached at telephone number 312-
751-4943.

Privacy Rights
The information collected during the PIV process may be disclosed in accordance with the Railroad Retirement Board’s published routine uses as
stated in System of Records RRB-46 and RRB-48 and as otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a), including disclosure:
to the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Labor
Relations Authority upon an authorized request; to agencies, contractors, and others to administer personnel and payroll systems, for debt
collection and for employment or security investigations; to law enforcement agencies if the Railroad Retirement Board becomes aware of a
possible violation of a law or regulation; to a Congressional office in response to requests made on your behalf; to the Department of Justice,
courts, and counsel during litigation; to unions if needed to perform their authorized duties; to other agencies under approved computer
matches; and as otherwise authorized by law or regulations.


Violations of Privacy

Any person who knowing and willfully discloses information in violation of the Privacy Act is subject to civil, criminal and/or administrative
penalties.

Please contact the Bureau of Human Resources (312/751-4580) with any questions regarding the information contained in this notice.
