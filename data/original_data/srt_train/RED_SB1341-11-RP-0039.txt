C.1  STATEMENT OF WORK

 1.  BACKGROUND

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 emphasizes the need for the United States to move toward electronic health records
(EHRs).  The legislation calls out the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in part, to establish a Health Information
Technology Testing Infrastructure (HITTI) that supports effective industry consensus standards development processes and provides the U.S.
healthcare information technology (IT) industry and federal activities with robust conformance and interoperability testing capabilities.

NIST will be responsible for leading the development of the core HITTI that will provide a scalable, multi-partner, automated, remote capability
for current and future testing needs.  An initial emphasis will be on testing the standards addressing high national healthcare priorities
(e.g., as identified and/or defined in concept of Electronic Health Record technology “meaningful use”). NIST will work with standard and
specification development organizations and other stakeholders to ensure appropriate feedback mechanisms exist for updating the standards.

To date, NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has performed initial evaluations of specialized healthcare workflows (e.g., cross
document exchange (XDS), Patient Identifier Cross-Reference (PIX) and Patient Demographics Query (PDQ), device enterprise communication (DEC)
via patient care devices (PCD), and clinical document architecture (CDA) including laboratory reports, summary documents, and emergency
encounter summaries) and has developed conformance and interoperability test tools and software test artifacts based on standards (including HL7
versions 2 and 3).

NIST has a need to further define and develop core testing infrastructural components and services to enable a wide-scope of test tools to
support the national health care priorities with focus on electronic health record communication and electronic document (clinical) exchange
across domains including (but not limited by) bio-surveillance, e-prescribing, laboratory, immunization, patient administration, and medical
devices.  National priorities addressed within this statement of work must be in alignment with priorities called out in Office of the National
Coordinator (ONC) meaningful use criteria as identified via the staged approach and enacted through  ‘rules’[1].  Following this definition,
design, development, and implementation and testing of such services and software is sought.

The contract will include a base period of two (2) years and three (3) one year option periods.

The Government requires that all phases of the HITTI infrastructure methodology be successfully completed during the two year base period.  This
includes, at a minimum, Project Approach and Initiation, Requirements Development, HITTI Design, Software Development, Testing of software
developed, Deployment, and Maintenance.

The Government requires that all work required to, at a minimum, enable and manage the methodology will be accomplished for conformance
(unit), integration and interoperability test environments across on-site and remote testing modes.

Work under Option Period I shall build upon and expand the existing HITTI scope of testing and the services as identified by the criteria within
the stages of “meaningful use” and identified national electronic healthcare testing priorities.  Appropriate requirements definition and
refinement, HITTI Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance shall be conducted.  The Government anticipates particular focus on
expansion of test artifacts and the peer-to-peer (i.e. multi-partner) test environment capability developed in the base period.

Work under Option Period II shall build upon and expand the existing HITTI scope of testing and the services as identified by the criteria
within the later stages of “meaningful use” and identified national electronic healthcare testing priorities.  Appropriate requirements
definition and refinement, HITTI Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance shall be conducted.  The Government anticipates
particular focus on expansion of test artifacts and the peer-to-peer test environment capability developed in the base period and in Option
Period I.

Work under Option Period III shall build upon and expand the existing HITTI scope of testing and the services as identified by the criteria
within the later stages of “meaningful use” and identified national electronic healthcare testing priorities.  Appropriate requirements
definition and refinement, HITTI Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance shall be conducted.  The Government anticipates
particular focus on expansion of test artifacts and the peer-to-peer test environment capability developed in the base period and in subsequent
option periods.


2.  OBJECTIVE

The objective of this contract is to harmonize the efforts of healthcare standards test development and delivery to meet the demands for
conformance and interoperability within the healthcare domain.  The Contractor shall work in collaboration with health IT stakeholders such as
vendors, implementers, standards organizations, and certification bodies to establish a testing infrastructure that will:

   -Provide a variety of conformance and interoperability testing services:  The infrastructure must define a set of services including, but not
   limited to, healthcare application test agents and reference implementations, tools to validate standards, tools to generate test materials,
   and registries and repositories to support testing.  The testing services form the basis to conduct conformance and interoperability testing
   of healthcare data exchange standards.


   -Support a broad range of test environments:  The infrastructure must support multiple testing environments including instance validation
   testing (e.g., validation of an HL7 V2.5 message), isolated system testing (e.g., validation of HL7 V2.5 messages reported and consumed by one
   System Under Test [SUT]), and peer-to-peer system testing (e.g., validation of HL7 V2.5 messages reported and consumed by multiple SUTs). The
   testing may occur on-site (e.g., testing that is conducted in-house at a vendor’s or software tester’s location in which the system under test
   and test tool/system are local) or be remote (e.g., testing via the internet where system testing is conducted remotely).




   -Support numerous health data exchange standards: The infrastructure must
   provide services to test health workflows that employ multiple messaging and document data exchange standards.

   -Provide a component-based user interface:  The infrastructure must include multiple components that will enable different stakeholders to use
   the infrastructure in different ways.

   -Enable user customization: The infrastructure must allow different stakeholders to build their own instances of the testing services to
   support their individual needs.


   -Support changing user requirements:  The infrastructure must provide a framework that is modular, flexible, and expandable to meet changing
   stakeholder demands.


   -Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards:  The infrastructure
   must provide a mechanism that will provide valuable feedback about the health data exchange standards and specifications.


The following items are not within scope of this contract and shall not be considered part of the HITTI:


   -Developing standards – NIST will not create standards; this project will develop an infrastructure necessary to test implementations of
   existing standards and/or specifications.


   -Performing certifications – NIST will not perform product certification; this project will provide the test infrastructure and tools that can
   be used by recognized certification bodies.


   -Conducting operational testing – NIST will not conduct any type of operational or functional testing; this project will provide the software
   test tools that can be leveraged by the stakeholder organizations for their testing processes.


   All software developed under this contract will be made freely and publically available by the Contractor.  No commercial (i.e. pay for
   products) shall be part of the testing infrastructure.


Key stakeholders for the Health IT Testing Infrastructure are depicted in the Figure 1 below:
[pic]
                                            Figure 1: Key Stakeholders for HIT Testing Infrastructure

   The Contractor, in collaboration with NIST, shall work with each of these stakeholders (see Figure 1 and Table 1) to establish and utilize the
   testing infrastructure that will help ensure that the health information of Americans is exchanged safely, securely, reliably, and only
   between appropriate parties, and that the standards used are appropriate, consistent, and effective.

4.  REQUIREMENTS AND TASK AREAS

This section provides the task area requirements for the framework along with the components comprising the scope of this requirement.  The
requirements of the HITTI project that the Contractor shall address are provided in tabular form in Section 4.2 below.


1 General Requirements

   The HITTI must address the following general requirements:

-Provision for a variety of conformance and interoperability testing infrastructural services covering a wide range of services and artifacts
needed for testing electronic healthcare applications, including but not limited to communication, security, data, storage and retrieval,
validation, generation, evaluation, time, test management, configuration, test execution, logging, analyzing, and reporting;


- Support a broad range of test environments (including but not limited to instance validation test environment for conformance, isolated system
testing environment for integration, and peer-to-peer system testing environment for interoperability);


-Support a variety of stakeholders including, but not limited to Government standards panels (e.g., HITSP), certification bodies, vendors,
implementers, and other industry consortia;


-Support multiple delivery mechanisms, including but not limited to web-based, standalone and hybrid applications used to enable processing and
exchange of EHRs;


-Support health data exchange standards including, at a minimum, HL7 V2, HL7 V3 and CDA documents, DICOM, NCPDP, vocabularies and code sets;
including but not limited to SNOMED Clinical Terms [SNOMED CTR] and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes [LOINCR], and optionally the
ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards;


   -Provide a component-based user interface;


   -Enable user customization;


   -Support changing user requirements;


   -Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards;


   -Define supporting components including, but not limited to, interfaces,
   common file formats, test scenario and test scenario description language.



4.1.1 Scoping the General Requirements

   To accomplish these requirements, the Contractor must ensure that the framework conceptually contains multiple layers that meet the different
   health IT stakeholder needs.  Figure 2 (see below) depicts what NIST visualizes to be the major pieces of the framework.  The terminology used
   to describe the framework is provided only to convey to the Contractor the conceptual view of what constitutes the HITTI; therefore,
   definitions provided below are non-binding.


                                                                      [pic]

   Figure 2: Testing Infrastructure Conceptual View


-Components are the highest level of the infrastructure and define the overarching category of functionality to be defined for the HITTI (e.g.
test execution and test management).

   -Environments are the specific types of functionality within a defined component.  For example, with regard to ‘Test Execution’, it is
   expected that there are at least three test environments including instance testing, isolated system testing, and peer-to-peer testing.


   -Scenarios are the depiction of a sequence of processes and services within a specific environment to demonstrate interactions within a system
   and between systems.  For example, within instance testing, one test scenario would show steps involved to validate a clinical document.


   -Process Execution is the test harness which orchestrates services to produce an executable implementation of the testing scenarios. A
   management control system may provide input (test scripts) that directs the actions within process execution.  An example process execution
   for the C32 HITSP ‘Summary Documents Using HL7 Continuity of Care Document’ (CCD) validation would be to send an artifact and return
   validation result(s).


   -Services are formally specified functions based on the activities they perform.  Each service has well defined responsibilities and
   authority.  Services work together in collaboration to support the test scenarios.  Example services include test agents, validators, test
   generators, and repositories.

The Contractor shall define and propose a model which includes the conceptual layers described.  To further elaborate, Table 2 below provides
examples of NIST’s intended framework for the HITTI project.  The framework identified shall be used as a basis for further defining (or
refining) the requirements of components across both a user and system views.

4.1.2 Baseline General Requirements

A high level framework has been conceptualized by NIST to identify baseline requirements for the HITTI project; Over the past several years NIST
has defined, designed, and developed some of the anticipated components comprising the HITTI.  Based on this experience it is expected that
during the requirements development phase, specific scenarios shall be developed for each component by the Contractor.  These scenarios shall
identify and lead to the processes and services that are required and ultimately delivered in software.  Additional requirements will likely be
discovered and defined throughout the project.  Subsequent and more detailed scenarios as discovered and refined through an iterative process
shall be identified and defined in the requirements and design phase by the Contractor. It is expected that near the end of the two year base
period, further discovery and refinement will need to occur in the three one-year option periods).


1 Functional Requirements and Contract Tasks

The following table provides the minimum required capabilities and sub-capabilities along with the refined requirement text and contract tasks
that shall be addressed and completed by the Contractor and included in execution of the HITTI project:

to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions.
    (1) Descriptions or definitions:
      (i) "Contractor" means the business entity receiving the award of this contract, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and
successors in interest.
      (ii) "Development" means all efforts towards solution of broadly defined problems. This may encompass research, evaluating technical
feasibility, proof of design and test, or engineering of programs not yet approved for acquisition or operation.
      (iii) "Proprietary Information" means all information designated as proprietary in accordance with law and regulation, and held in
confidence or disclosed under restriction to prevent uncontrolled distribution. Examples include limited or restricted data, trade secrets,
sensitive financial information, and computer software; and may appear in cost and pricing data or involve classified information.

occupy a highly influential and responsible position in determining the system's basic concepts and supervising their execution by other
contractors. The contractor's judgment and recommendations must be objective, impartial, and independent. To avoid the prospect of the
contractor's judgment or recommendations being influenced by its own products or capabilities, it is agreed that the contractor is precluded for
the life of the system from award of a DOC contract to supply the system or any of its major components, and from acting as a subcontractor or
consultant to a DOC supplier for the system or any of its major components.

H.5  1352.209-72  RESTRICTIONS AGAINST DISCLOSURE (APR 2010)

  (a) The contractor agrees, in the performance of this contract, to keep the information furnished by the Government or acquired/developed by
the contractor in performance of the contract and designated by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative, in the
strictest confidence.  The contractor also agrees not to publish or otherwise divulge such information, in whole or in part, in any manner or
form, nor to authorize or permit others to do so, taking such reasonable measures as are necessary to restrict access to such information while
in the contractor's possession, to those employees needing such information to perform the work described herein, i.e., on a "need to know"
basis.  The contractor agrees to immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing in the event that the contractor determines or has reason
to suspect a breach of this requirement has occurred.
  (b) The contractor agrees that it will not disclose any information described in subsection (a) to any person unless prior written approval is
obtained from the Contracting Officer.  The contractor agrees to insert the substance of this clause in any consultant agreement or subcontract
hereunder.
                    (End of clause)

H.6  1352.209-74  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)

  (a) Purpose.  The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:
    (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract,
and
    (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.
  (b) Scope.  The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates,
divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this
clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity.  For the purpose of this
clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to
control both.
  (c) Warrant and Disclosure.  The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all
subcontractors.  The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or
circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has
disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.  The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full
disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts
that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair
competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to
avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.
  (d) Remedies.  The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such
termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest.  If the contractor fails to
disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to
the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or
pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
  (e) Subcontracts.  The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any
subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The terms "contract," "contractor,"
and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
  (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.  The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part
9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational
conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award
of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.  If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized,
or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.  If the
contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor
agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
  (g) Waiver.  The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is
impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver
from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of
the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

    (4)  Documentation to support an exemption for the project from the Common Rule [NOTE: this option is not available for activities that fall
under 45 CFR Part 46 Subpart C].
  (f) In addition, if the contractor modifies a human subjects research protocol, questionnaire, survey, advertisement, or informed consent form
approved by the cognizant IRB, the contractor shall submit a copy of all modified material along with documentation of approval for said
modification by the cognizant IRB to the Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval.  The contractor shall not implement any IRB
approved-modification without written approval by the Contracting Officer.
  (g) No work involving human subjects may be undertaken, conducted, or costs incurred and/or charged to the project, until the Contracting
Officer approves the required appropriate documentation in writing.

the Government for review and approval as soon as it occurs.  Continuing approval of the human subjects research must be obtained from the
cognizant IRB and provided to the Government until the research is completed or terminated.  The  contractor may proceed with previously
approved human subjects research, if any, under this contract while the Government is conducting continuing review and approval of the human
subjects research protocol.  In the event that the Government determines, during the course of its review, that the human subjects research in
this contract is not in compliance with the regulations set forth at 15 CFR Part 27, or this contract, the Contracting Officer may take the
appropriate enforcement action, including disallowing costs, suspending or terminating the human subjects protocol or the contract, by notifying
the contractor in writing.
  (d) It is incumbent upon contractor to ensure that continuing IRB review approval occurs in accordance with 15 CFR Part 27.  In the event that
continuing review approval does not occur as set forth by 15 CFR Part 27, contractor is to notify the Contracting Officer immediately.
  (e) Contractor must report all adverse events to the cognizant IRB and to the Contracting Officer.  In the event that adverse events are
reported to the cognizant IRB and the Contracting Officer, the Government may suspend this contract pending a full review of the adverse event
by the cognizant IRB.
  (f) If the conditions upon which IRB approval is based should change in any way, contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer,
in writing, of the specified change.
  (g) Failure to comply with this contract clause will be considered material noncompliance with the contract, and the Contracting Officer may
take appropriate enforcement action, including disallowing costs, suspension or termination of the contract.

this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the
Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of

  (b) "Amendments to solicitations." If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors
shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).

      (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and
      (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using

      (ii)

          (3) It is the only proposal received.

installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of
Government personnel.
      (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office

solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
      (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may

for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall--
    (1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
  This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in
part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection
with-the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the
resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from
another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of
sheets]; and
    (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
  Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
  (f) "Contract award."
    (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s)
represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
    (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest.
    (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
    (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described
in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical
standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an
efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest
number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
    (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
    (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards  if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the
Government's best interest to do so.
    (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
    (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or
subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is
significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
    (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or
schedule risk.
    (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the
proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
    (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
      (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer.
      (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information
on the debriefed offeror.
      (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
      (iv) A summary of the rationale for award.
      (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror .
      (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the
solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

L.12  52.237-10  IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME (OCT 1997)

  (a) "Definitions." As used in this provision--
  "Uncompensated overtime" means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge
employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be
included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.
  "Uncompensated overtime rate" is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by
the proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated
overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 x 40 divided by 45=$17.78).
  (b) For any proposed hours against which an uncompensated overtime rate is applied, the offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in
excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by labor category at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime
rate per hour, whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for
personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct.
  (c) The offeror's accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting practices used to
accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours.
  (d) Proposals that include unrealistically low labor rates, or that do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a risk
assessment and will be evaluated for award in accordance with that assessment.
  (e) The offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime with its proposal.
          (End of Provision)

reserves the right to make an award without discussions based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their
initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed. If award is not made upon
initial proposals, then the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals. If the
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an
efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest
number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly- rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be
offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement.

    (2) Discussions/Final Proposal Revisions. The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in
accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of discussions, a final common cut-off date for submission of final proposal revisions will be
established. Those offerors remaining in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions.

    (3) Final Evaluation of Offers. A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions.

-----------------------
[1] Existing and proposed conditions are being defined by the Office of the National Coordinator with input by the public.  High level
requirements, defined through meaningful use criteria, will be affected through a staged approach and enacted through proposed final rules.
Throughout the period of performance of this acquisition, the meaningful use criteria will be defined by the ONC and the Contractor should build
the HITTI system to be in alignment of and meet these requirements.

Currently the federal advisory committee, and the Health Information Technology Policy Committee (HITPC), have identified five priority health
outcome areas.  Meaningful Use Stage 1 and final rule have been defined.  Proposed objectives for stages 2 (2013) and 3 (2015) are in a request
for comment period.
