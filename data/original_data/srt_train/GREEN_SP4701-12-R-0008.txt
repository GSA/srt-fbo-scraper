To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008 FAR 52.212-4 (continued)

Page: 13 of 83

considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

Each applicable price evaluation preference or adjustment shall be calculated independently against an offeror's base offer. These individual preference amounts shall be added together to arrive at the total evaluated price for that offer. (4) When the two highest rated offerors are a HUBZone small business concern and a large business, and the evaluated offer of the HUBZone small business concern is equal to the evaluated offer of the large business after considering the price evaluation preference, award will be made to the HUBZone small business concern. (c) Waiver of evaluation preference. A HUBZone small business concern may elect to waive the evaluation preference, in which case the factor will be added to its offer for evaluation purposes. The agreements in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause do not apply if the offeror has waived the evaluation preference. __ Offer elects to waive the evaluation preference. (d) Agreement. A HUBZone small business concern agrees that in the performance of the contract, in the case of a contract for (1) Services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance will be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small business concerns; (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing, excluding the cost of materials, will be performed by the concern or other HUBZone small business concerns; (3) General construction.

Describe your current and planned proposed range of services, supplies, and any other support that will be provided to you by small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, and SDVOSB small business concerns. Include specific names of subcontractors to the extent they are known.

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008 PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 1.1 INTRODUCTION

Page: 33 of 83

The requesting office is DLA HQ Acquisition directorate (J-7), of the Defense Logistics Agency. The mission of J-7 is to manage acquisition policy and provide procurement policy direction to the DLA contracting offices. J-7 also participates with Department of Defense (DOD) and other Federal agencies in the development of Federal and DOD-wide policy on matters concerning procurement. Furthermore, J-7 develops, implement, maintain, and interpret procurement policy in a manner that facilitates provision of cost-effective logistics support to meet DOD/Agency strategic goals. 1.2 SCOPE

The Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to procure an integrated, cost-effective, flexible web-based Reverse Auction Pricing Tool (RAPT) system that will meet the needs of DLA from contract inception through full deployment of the tool. 1.3 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

Specific Tasks - The Reverse Auction Pricing Tool (RAPT) auction services must: 1.3.1 Web-based Auction Events - Provide a secure, user-friendly architecture that allows Federal Government Agencies as well as their sources of supply, both foreign and domestic, to participate in real-time, online, web-based auction events. Each Bidder's identity must be anonymous to other bidders. Proper Authorization - The RAPT shall not be accessible without the proper authorization and accessible only for the duration of the event, since much of the data disclosed during an auction event is proprietary. User-friendly Tool - Provide a tool that is easy to use and that participant's need only a cursory overview of the tool in order to adequately use it.

1.3.2

1.3.3

1.3.4 Accommodate DLA-PLFAs - The RAPT shall have the ability to accommodate separate realms for each of the DLA Primary Level Field Activities (PLFAs) but shall also have the option for visibility for DLA and the other PLFAs. (For example, Troop Support shall be able to conduct RA events without Aviation receiving notifications and information pertaining to the event. However, if DLA Troop Support decides to give other PLFAs or HQ visibility, the option shall be available). 1.3.5 Real-time Visibility ­ DLA shall have the ability to determine the runtime for an event. The event shall occur in real-time so that all participants know the exact status of the event at any given point. 1.3.6 Review Team - The offeror shall setup a "Review Team" to provide feedback to

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008

Page: 34 of 83

Government personnel during the process to build an auction document in the RAPT, which explains how the tool works. 1.3.7 Input of bids - Only the Government shall have access to input into the system the original offerors proposed prices, before the official auction. Once the live auction begins it becomes the offeror's responsibility to input any updated proposal pricing. 1.3.8 Self Reliance - Permit the Government personnel to be self-reliant in the setup and execution of the events including supplier registrations and participant invitations. Functionality within DLA infrastructure - Provide a solution that will function within the DLA infrastructure without the need for installation of additional software or programs.

1.3.9

1.3.10 Compatibility to infrastructure - The restrictions and security requirements of the DLA infrastructure prevents users from installing software without prior approval. The approval process is extensive and not cost effective to pursue on a case by case basis. DLA user desktops are running either Windows 7 or Windows XP SP2. The standard web browsing software consists of Microsoft Internet Explorer v6.0 SPI or higher, Netscape Communicator v4.76, Adobe Reader v7.0.8, , Windows Media Player v9.0, Macromedia Flash Player v9, Apple QuickTime Movie and Audio Viewer v6.3, Internet Pictures iPIX v6.2.0.5, DirectX v9.0b, and Sun Java v1.3.l_l5, v1.4.2_06, and v1.5.0_01. IT specs subject to change. Offeror shall confirm prior to completing programming on RAPT. 1.3.11 User specific Java applets & other files - Java applets and other files downloaded to work with the above list cannot be installed to the "All Users" folder of the "Documents and Settings" folder of the operating system. They must be directed to the specific user folder logged onto the desktop. Users are very limited in changing any configuration settings on their desktop. 1.3.12 Training (Government & Contractor) - Provide initial training of the tool to each DLA field activities designated Reverse Auction POC (NTE 30 at a time), and for all contractors participating in an auction event for an initial period of at least 120 days after award so that DLA field activities are comfortable in performing the training on their own. Key Government personnel will require some specific training on the use and management of the tool. We also would like the offeror to assist with supplier training on the first view events to aid in becoming more familiar with the tool. 1.3.13 Technical Support for global user-base - Provide technical support of the system 24 hours, 7 days a week to accommodate the global user base. 1.3.14 Separate the PLFAs ­ Ensure the Reverse Auction Pricing Tool (RAPT) has the ability to separate the PLFAs under the DLA umbrella i.e., each activity will be visible to HQ when necessary, but not visible to the other activities.

Page: 35 of 83

Run and Manage RAPT ­ Key Government personnel are expected to completely run and manage the reverse auction pricing tool without the need for contractor intervention with the exception of occasional technical support. World Wide Internet Accessibility ­ The RAPT must have world-wide internet accessibility.

1.3.16

1.3.17 User defined data ­ The RAPT must be able to receive user defined data in its native format, from any previous version or tool. The RAPT shall provide the ability to conduct auctions for multiple line items and apply bid constraints for all or each line item as necessary.

The Government will ensure quality assurance of all tasks with 100% inspections performed by the COR. During the inspections, the COR will review for current task completion. The specified checks and measures will be completed on daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly schedules depending on the task. 1.6 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Certification by the Government of satisfactory services provided is contingent upon the Contractor performing in accordance with the performance standards contained in the Performance Requirements Summary Matrix (Section 1.6.5) and all terms and conditions of this order, including all modifications. 1.6.1 Performance Evaluation Performance measures will be used to assess the Contractors performance under this contract(s) in order to determine whether the Contractor is performing at acceptable levels in order to allow for a 100% payment. The Government will make objective and subjective assessments of the Contractor's performance to determine whether Contractor performance is acceptable. The Contractor is expected to perform all functions in a professional manner and prepare accurate and timely documentation. Progress will be tracked based on the milestone event when the Contractor receives a specific tasking. 1.6.2 Performance Measurements The performance measurements under this contract(s) shall be based on timeliness and quality of the work and deliverables provided by the Contractor under the contract(s). These measurements are defined as: Timeliness ­ The completion of tasks and/or the submission of deliverables within the schedule set forth by the government during the performance of the contract(s).

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008 Exhibit I Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) 1. Performance Requirement Summary

Page: 44 of 83

The purpose of the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is to describe the methods that will be used to measure performance and to identify the reports required and the resources to be employed. This acquisition is to provide support to assist in the implementation of processes, procedures, standards, applications, technologies and tools that will increase the productivity of the Defense Logistics Agency Reverse Auction Pricing Tool (RAPT). The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards identified in the RFP. This QASP is developed in accordance with the requirements listed in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the Reverse Auction Pricing Tool (RAPT). The QASP sets forth the procedures and guidelines the Government will use in evaluating the technical performance of the contractor. This requirement will be awarded as a firm-fixed price. Therefore, performance measures will be used to assess the contractor's performance under this contract in order to determine whether the contractor is performing at acceptable levels. The Government will make objective and subjective assessments of the contractor's performance to determine whether contractor performance is acceptable. The Contractor is expected to perform all functions in a professional manner and prepare accurate and timely documentation. This QASP is designed to define roles and responsibilities, identify the performance objectives, define the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance, describe quality assurance reporting, and describe the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results. The contractor's internal quality control system will set forth the procedures for self-inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, and other performance requirements in the PWS. The contractor will utilize its internal quality control system to assess and report their performance to the designated Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR will monitor performance and review performance reports furnished by the contractor to determine how the contractor is performing against communicated performance objectives. The COR will make decisions based on performance measurement metric data and notify the contractor of those decisions. The contractor will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is managed effectively. The Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible for monitoring contract compliance, contract administration and cost control; and resolving any differences between the observations documented by the COR and the contractor's performance. The KO will designate one full-time COR as the Government authority for performance management. The COR is responsible for monitoring, assessing, and communicating the technical performance

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008

Page: 45 of 83

and support of the contractor. The COR will have the responsibility for evaluation of the contractor's work performance.

2.

Method of Surveillance/Measures to Validate

In an effort to minimize the contract administration burden, simplified methods of surveillance techniques shall be used by the Government to evaluate contractor performance. There are various surveillance methods used to monitor contract performance and compliance. When selecting the appropriate method, the COR will take into consideration task criticality, task complexity, time available, mission requirements. The following are preferred methods of surveillance that may be used to assess contract performance: a. Customer complaint: Any customer observing unacceptable services, either incomplete or not performed, for any performance objectives. The COR will evaluate the complaints on a case by case basis. If any Government action or lack of action caused the unacceptable performance, the complaint against the contractor is not valid. The COR will document the invalid complaint and keep for their records. If the complaint is not a result of any Government action, the procedures as detailed in Section 4 will be followed. b. Periodic Inspection: This type of surveillance is based upon selecting samples for evaluation on other than 100% inspection or on a statistically random basis. The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication with the Program Office. The primary objective of professional communications is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through compliments and complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be customer focused through initially addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or problems. Below are the Performance Standards that will be used in evaluating performance: Highly Acceptable ­ Meets or exceeds contract requirements in terms of timeliness and quality. COR will make a determination to pay the contractor 100% of the monthly invoice amount. Acceptable ­ Meets all requirements of the PWS with only minor revisions necessary and the revisions do not adversely impact the mission of the Agency. Performance is satisfactory. The COR will make a determination to pay the contractor 95% of the monthly invoice amount. Marginally Acceptable ­ Has two or more issues that were not minor, such as missed milestones, quality levels of work and/or documents requiring multiple reviews and rework, significant or serious complaints submitted by the program office, or documents that did not comply with acquisition or policy regulations. The COR will make a determination to pay the contractor 85% of the monthly invoice amount after the correction(s) has/have been made.

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008

Page: 46 of 83

Unacceptable ­ Performance has been Marginal for more than one month or at a level where the Contracting Officer has to issue one or more cure notices regarding performance. Payment for the month will be withheld pending resolution of issues and cure notice(s). Upon satisfactory resolution of issues and cure notice(s), payment for the month in question will be made at the Marginal rate. If issues are not resolved, no payment will be made. Continual monthly performance at the unacceptable level will be at a level where a termination for default will be considered if the performance is not improved.

3.

Surveillance Schedule

At the end of each month, the COR may be required to prepare a written report for the KO summarizing the overall results of the quality assurance monitoring of the contractor's performance. The KO or COR may require the Contractor's PM or a designated alternate, to meet with the Contracting Officer and other Government personnel as deemed necessary to discuss performance evaluation. The COR will define a frequency of in-depth reviews with the contractor, however if the need arises, the contractor may meet with the Contracting Officer as often as required or per the contractor's request. The agenda of the reviews may discuss:      Monthly performance measured by the metrics and trends Issues and concerns of both parties Projected outlook for upcoming months and progress against expected trend Recommendations made by the COR based on contractor information Issues arising from independent reviews and inspections

In addition to QA monitoring, the COR will use the information contained in the contractor's monthly status report to assess the contractor's level of performance for each objective measured in this QASP. The COR must coordinate and communicate with the contractor to resolve issues and concerns of marginal or unacceptable performance. The contractor will discuss with the KO/COR satisfaction ratings receiving a "less than acceptable" rating. For such cases, the contractor should highlight its perspective and present plans to adjust service levels accordingly to bring the unsatisfactory rating up to an acceptable level. The KO/COR and contractor should jointly formulate tactical and long­term courses of action. Decisions regarding changes to metrics, thresholds, or service levels should be clearly documented. Changes to service levels, procedures, and metrics will be incorporated as a contract modification at the convenience of the Contracting Officer. 4. Failure to Perform

The contractor may receive deductions or even termination based on failure to perform. The following criteria apply for determining appropriate action: 1. Notifications. Pursuant with FAR Part 52.212-4(m), the KO shall notify the contractor of their

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008

Page: 47 of 83

failure to meet standards through various means of communications (e.g.: phone, email, etc.) cure notices, or show cause notices and shall inform the contractor's project manager or designated alternate of such notices. 2. Deductions. The Government has the right to withhold a percentage of payment annual cost for performing particular services based on failure to meet performance standards. The percentage of such withholding is identified in Section 2, herein. 3. Termination. If the Contracting Officer determines that the contractor has failed to perform to the extent that a termination for default is justified, the KO shall consider a notice of termination, consistent with FAR Part 52.212-4(m). The COR will perform inspections to ensure contractor compliance with the appropriate paragraphs in the PWS, other government requirements, and the contractor's own procedures, and will record the results of the inspections, noting the date and time. If inspection indicates a performance level is not met, the KO will notify the contractor of the deficiency for correction. The contractor will be given a reasonable time after notification to correct the unacceptable performance. The length of time allowed to correct the problem will depend upon the requirement, complexity of corrective action(s) and the deficiency. The contractor will notify the KO if the time allowed for correction is not adequate. The COR will not consider the correction action(s) until all deficiencies have been corrected and determined by the COR to be adequate. Contractor non-responsiveness, deficiencies not adequately addressed or corrected after notification of such, or estimated dates of completion that are not acceptable to the COR will be forwarded to the KO.

OFFEROR PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS This section specifies the format and content that offerors shall use for responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP). Offerors are required to respond in accordance with these instructions. The goal is not to restrict the offerors in the manner in which they will perform their work but rather to ensure a certain degree of uniformity in the format of the responses for evaluation purposes. In order to receive full consideration, firms are encouraged to ensure that the information provided within their proposal is factual, accurate and complete. The offeror is responsible for providing adequate documentation to enable a thorough evaluation of the proposal. The offeror shall submit a proposal that clearly and concisely describes and defines the offeror's response to the objectives/requirements contained in the RFP. Unnecessary elaboration or other presentations beyond that sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper or bindings, and expensive visual or other presentation aids are neither necessary nor desired. Responses which merely repeat the Performance Work Statement will not be considered as being responsive to the requirements of this RFP. Assurances of experience, capability, qualifications, without a clear demonstration to support this claim, will adversely influence the evaluation of the proposal. The proposal shall contain all the pertinent information in sufficient detail in the area of the proposal where it contributes most critically to the discussion of the same information. When necessary, the offeror shall refer to the initial discussion and identify its location within the proposal. If an offeror does not understand the instructions contained herein, written notification should be provided to the Contracting Officer for clarification sufficiently in advance of the deadline for the receipt of proposals to get an answer in time to meet the deadline. The Government will publish the questions asked and the answers given, and distribute them to all prospective offerors. Alternate proposals are not authorized. Exceptions to any terms and conditions of the RFP may make the proposal unacceptable. ORAL PRESENTATION/MOCK AUCTION An Oral Presentation is a technique that is used to provide offerors with the opportinuity to present information through oral means. For this requirement, the Oral Presentation will consist of Mock Auctions based on three (3) separate scenarios. The use of this technique will provide the Government with a more comprehensize understanding of a Company's Reverse Auction Tool. The purpose of using the Oral presentation/Mock Auction technique is to eliminate, or greatly reduce, the need for written material, where information can be conveyed in a more meaningful and efficient way through verbal means. One of the benefits of the Oral Presentation/Mock Auction is that it permits the evaluators to receive information demonstrating the offeror's understanding of the work or describing how the work will be performed, directly

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008 ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-1 (continued) from key members of the offeror's team that will actually perform the work.

Evaluation Factor #2 ­ Past Performance/Corporate Experience: The offeror will be required to address their level of experience in successfully providing the services required under PWS and their past performance on such projects. Each firm will be required to clearly demonstrate within its proposal that it has sufficient experience to perform satisfactorily. Requiring submission of Past Performance information will permit the government to evaluate the contractor's proposal with respect to that experience and make a determination as to the degree of risk in making award to that contractor. The contractor shall demonstrate that their organization has performed projects and/or tasks of similar scope and complexity as those referenced under the scope of the RFP located in Performance Work Statement. The contractor shall provide: ˇ At least three (3) contracts/accounts and a maximum of five (5), commercial or Government, performed within the last five (5) years for the same or similar services proposed in this RFP ˇ These contracts/accounts shall provide a brief description of the type of work performed and in what ways is the previous work described is similar to the current requirement;

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008 ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 (continued)

Page: 64 of 83

ˇ Each contract/account must list the name, address, point of contact, telephone number, dollar value and period of performance. The Government reserves the right to consider additional past performance sources including the PPIRS system. Each reference shall include both a contracting as well as a technical point of contact. The contractor shall ensure that information presented for contact points is accurate and current (i.e., current phone numbers, titles, etc.) and cooperative for providing references. The Government will not attempt to "track down" reference data in cases where inaccurate data is presented. Incomplete or inaccurate data may lead to a lower evaluation rating and possibly, elimination from further consideration for award. There are two aspects to this Past Performance/Corporate Experience evaluation: 1) a determination of relevance of other contracts performed to the requirements of the solicitation and 2) a determination of how well the contractor performed on these prior contracts. These above two aspects, when combined, will result in the contractor's overall performance confidence assessment rating. Please note that one factor in evaluating the relevancy of past performance of large businesses will be Socioeconomic Subcontracting Goals. Socioeconomic Subcontracting Goals include mentoring with Small Business (SB) Concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Concerns, Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI), HUBZone Small Business (HUBZone SB) Concerns, Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns, and Javits-WagnerO'Day Act (JWOD) entities. (Reference DLAD provision 52.215-9003, Socioeconomic Evaluation; 52.215-9005, AbilityOne, (formerly called Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act ("JWOD")) entity support evaluation; and/or 52.219-9002, DLA Mentoring Business Agreements (MBA) Program, as contained in a contract in effect during the period two years prior to this solicitation's closing date.) APPLICABLE TO LARGE BUSINESS OFFERORS ONLY

Evaluation Factor #3 ­ Socioeconomic Support Evaluation: The Socioeconomic Proposal provided by the offeror under 52.215-9002 will be evaluated on a comparative basis among all offerors. An offeror that proposes a higher percentage, complexity level, and variety of participation by small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) small businesses combined, generally will receive a higher rating on this factor. An offeror's efforts to develop additional opportunities for small, small disadvantaged womenowned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, and SDVOSB small businesses will also be comparatively evaluated with the proposals of other offerors. Offerors' proposals for socioeconomic support will be made a part of any resulting contract for

Solicitation Number SP4701-12-R-0008 ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 (continued)

Page: 65 of 83

use in determining how well the contractor has adhered to its socioeconomic plan. This plan will be monitored by the cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency's small business office as a means of assisting the contracting officer in determining how well the contractor has in fact performed. This determination will then be used as a consideration prior to option exercise and future source selection decisions. Performance on prior contracts in subcontracting with and assisting small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, and SDVOSB small businesses will be part of past performance evaluation. Price Evaluation: The contractor's business/price proposal will be evaluated by the Contracting Officer to determine that pricing is fair and reasonable to the Government. The total acquisition price for the Reverse Auction Pricing Tool (RAPT) award will be determined by summing the proposed firm-fixed price for the base year and two option years.
