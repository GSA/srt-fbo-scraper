If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data (e.g., commercial information, financial information, cost and pricing data); and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following statements, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted: "Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), data contained in the portions of this proposal which the offeror has specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that HHS may not be able to withhold a record (e.g. data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the HHS's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if HHS has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages ( insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)." (2) In addition, the offeror must mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may

- 51 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection; (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. (End of Provision) Alternate I (October 1997).As prescribed in 15.209(a)(1), substitute the following paragraph (f)(4) for paragraph (f)(4) of the basic provision: (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

4. Separation of Technical and Business Proposals The proposal must be prepared in two parts: a "Technical Proposal" and a "Business Proposal." Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other. The technical proposal must include direct cost and resources information, such as labor-hours and categories and applicable rates, materials, subcontracts, travel, etc., and associated costs so that the offeror's understanding of the project may be evaluated (See SECTION J, Attachment entitled, TECHNICAL PROPOSAL COST SUMMARY.) However, the technical proposal should not include pricing data relating to individual salary information, indirect cost rates or amounts, fee amounts (if any), and total costs. The technical proposal should disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions. 5. Alternate Proposals You may, at your discretion, submit alternate proposals, or proposals which deviate from the requirements; provided, that you also submit a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the statement of work. Such proposals may be considered if overall performance would be improved or not compromised and if they are in the best interests of the Government. Alternative proposals, or deviations from any requirements of this RFP, shall be clearly identified. 6. Evaluation of Proposals The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the factors set forth in PART IV, SECTION M of this RFP. 7. Potential Award Without Discussions The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary. 8. Use of the Metric System of Measurement It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to support the Federal transition to the metric system and to use the metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business related activities unless such use is impracticable or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies. The offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement. The following definitions are provided for your information: Hard Metric - - The replacement of a standard inch-pound size with an accepted metric size for a particular purpose. An example of size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart (as for soft drinks), or instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline). Soft Metric - The result of a mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents for a particular purpose. The physical characteristics are not changed. Dual Systems - The use of both inch-pound and metric systems. For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes.

9. Privacy Act - Treatment of Proposal Information The Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information, the authority which authorizes the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used, the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information. The NIH is requesting the information called for in this SOLICITATION pursuant to the authority provided by Sec. 301(a)(7) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended. Providing the information requested is entirely voluntary. The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract. Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review. In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number. Provision of the social security number is voluntary. Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of NIH contracting programs. Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 301 and Title IV of the PHS Act, as amended. The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes: ˇ to the cognizant audit agency and the Government Accountability Office for auditing. ˇ to the Department of Justice as required for litigation. ˇ to respond to congressional inquiries. ˇ to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees, for opinions as a part of the review process. 10. Selection of Offerors a. The acceptability of the scientific and technical portion of each research contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee. The committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation factors of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written critiques. The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror. b. The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a cost and price analysis, management analysis, etc. c. If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors. d. If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract 1. Communications will be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain.

- 58 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range. 2. The Contracting Officer will, in concert with program staff, decide which proposals are in the competitive range. The competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals. Oral or written discussions will be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. While it is NIAID's policy to conduct discussions with all offerors in the competitive range, NIAID reserves the right, in special circumstances, to limit the number of proposals included in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition. All aspects of the proposals are subject to discussions, including cost, technical approach, past performance, and contractual terms and conditions. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range shall be given an opportunity to submit a written Final Proposal Revision (FPR) with the reservation of the right to conduct finalization of details with the selected source in accordance with HHSAR 315.370. e. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 will be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. f. The NIAID reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the SOLICITATION. In addition, the SOLICITATION may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet NIAID requirements. Synopses of awards exceeding $25,000 will be published in FedBizOpps. 11. Institutional Responsibility Regarding Investigator Conflicts of Interest 45 CFR Part 94 promotes objectivity in research by establishing standards to ensure there is no reasonable expectation that the design, conduct, or reporting of research to be performed under NIH contracts will be biased by any Investigator financial conflicts of interest. The Institution shall comply with all requirements of 45 CFR Part 94 at http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx? c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=45:1.0.1.1.52&idno=45 12.

Human Subjects IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following subparagraphs shall be addressed, as applicable, in a SEPARATE SECTION of the Technical Proposal entitled, "HUMAN SUBJECTS." a. Notice to Offerors of Requirements of 45 CFR Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects, HHSAR 352.270-4(a) (January 2006) a. Copies of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR Part 46, are available from the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individuals who participate as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by the HHS. b. The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects. The use of autopsy materials is governed by applicable State and local law and is not directly regulated by 45 CFR Part 46. c. Activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1-6) are exempt from coverage. d. Inappropriate designations of the noninvolvement of human subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in delays in the review of a proposal. The Government's Project Officer will make a final determination of whether the proposed activities are covered by the regulations or are in an exempt category, based on the information provided in the proposal. In doubtful cases, the Project Officer will consult with OHRP. e. In accordance with 45 CFR Part 46, prospective Contractors being considered for award shall be required to file with OHRP an acceptable Assurance of Compliance with the regulations, specifying review procedures and assigning responsibilities for

NIH policy requires education on the protection of human subject participants for all investigators submitting NIH proposals for contracts for research involving human - 65 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

subjects. This policy announcement is found in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Announcement dated June 5, 2000 at the following website: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/ guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html. Offerors should review the policy announcement prior to submission of their offers. The following is a summary of the Policy Announcement: For any solicitation for research involving human subjects, the offeror shall provide in its technical proposal the following information: (1) a list of the names of the principal investigator and any other individuals proposed under the contract who are responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research; (2) the title of the education program completed (or to be completed prior to the award of the contract) for each named personnel; (3) a one sentence description of the program(s) listed in (2) above. This requirement extends to investigators and all individuals responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research who are working as subcontractors or consultants under the contract. Curricula that are readily available and meet the educational requirement include the NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) on-line tutorial, entitled "Protecting Human Research Participants" at: http://phrp.nihtraining.com. This course is also available in Spanish under the title "Protección de los participantes humanos de la investigación" at: http:// pphi.nihtraining.com. You may take the tutorials on-line or download the information in PDF form at no cost. The University of Rochester has made its training program available for individual investigators. Completion of this program will also satisfy the educational requirement. The University of Rochester manual can be obtained through Centerwatch, Inc. at http://store.centerwatch.com/p-51-protecting-study-volunteers-in-research-3rdedition.aspx. If an institution already has developed educational programs on the protection of research participants, completion of these programs also will satisfy the educational requirement. In addition, prior to the substitution of the principal investigator or any other individuals responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research under the contract, the Contractor shall provide the contracting officer with the title of the education program and a one sentence description of the program that the replacement has completed. d. Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that women and members of minority groups and their sub-populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research projects involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the relevant Institute/Center Director that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. The Director, NIH, may determine that exclusion under other circumstances is acceptable, upon the recommendation of an Institute/Center Director, based on a compelling rationale and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources. Women of childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43), and applies to research subjects of all ages. All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the UPDATED "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research, Amended October 2001," published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001 at the following web site: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm These guidelines contain a definition of clinical research adopted in June 2001, as: "(1) Patient-oriented research. Research conducted with human subjects (or on material of human origin such as tissues, specimens and cognitive phenomena) for which an - 66 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

investigator (or colleague) directly interacts with human subjects. Excluded from this definition are in vitro studies that utilize human tissues that cannot be linked to a living individual. Patient-oriented research includes (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) therapeutic interventions, (c) clinical trials, and (d) development of new technologies; (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies; and (3) Outcomes research and health services research." Information Required for ALL Clinical Research Proposals This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the offeror's plans for inclusion of women and minorities in the research proposed; or (2) the offeror's justification(s) for exclusion of one or both groups from the research proposed. Provide information on the composition of the proposed study population in terms of sex/ gender and racial/ethnic groups and provide a rationale for selection of such subjects in response to the requirements of the solicitation. The description may include (but is not limited to) information on the population characteristics of the disease or condition being studied in the planned research, and/or described in the statement of work, national and local demography, knowledge of the racial/ethnic/cultural characteristics of the population, prior experience and collaborations in recruitment and retention of the populations and subpopulations to be studied, and the plans, arrangements and letters of commitment from relevant community groups and organizations for the planned research. The proposal must include the following information: ˇ A description of the subject selection criteria ˇ The proposed dates of enrollment (beginning and end) ˇ A description of the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as subjects ˇ A compelling rationale for proposed exclusion of any sex/gender or racial/ethnic group ˇ The proposed sample composition using the "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table"(see Section J, Attachments) NOTE 1: For all proposals, use the ethnic and racial categories and complete the "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive No. 15, which may be found at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ fedreg_notice_15. NOTE 2: If this is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) or Requirements contract as defined in FAR 16.5, the proposal should describe in general terms how it will comply with each bulleted item above for each task order. When the Government issues a task order request for proposal, each of the bulleted information items must be fully and specifically addressed in the proposal. Standards for Collecting Data. When you, as a contractor, are planning data collection items on race and ethnicity, you shall use, at a minimum, the categories identified in OMB Directive No. 15. The collection of greater detail is encouraged. However, you should design any additional, more detailed items so that they can be aggregated into these required categories. Self-reporting or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. When you collect race and ethnicity separately, you must collect ethnicity first. You shall offer respondents the option of selecting one or more racial designations. When you collect data on race and ethnicity separately, you shall also make provisions to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. When you present aggregate data, you shall provide the number of respondents who selected only one category, for each of the five - 67 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

racial categories. If you collapse data on multiple responses, you shall make available, at a minimum, the total number of respondents reporting "more than one race." Federal agencies shall not present data on detailed categories if doing so would compromise data quality or confidentiality standards. In addition to the above requirements, solicitations for NIH defined Phase III clinical trials * require that: a) all proposals and/or protocols provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm, Definitions - Significant Difference). *The definition of an " NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trial" can also be found at this website.) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable; and b) all contractors to report annually cumulative subject accrual, and progress in conducting analyses for sex/gender and race/ethnicity differences. Offerors may obtain copies of the Updated Guidelines from the sources above or from the contact person listed in the solicitation. Also, the proposal must include one of the following plans: ˇ Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups, OR Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/ or racial/ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Use the form entitled, "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table," when preparing your response to the solicitation requirements for inclusion of women and minorities. (See Section J-List of Documents, Exhibits and Other Attachments of the RFP) Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, the Government has determined that the work required by this solicitation does not involve a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. Therefore, the NIH believes that the inclusion of women and minority populations is appropriate for this project. (See Section M of this RFP for more information about evaluation factors for award.) Use the form entitled, "Inclusion Enrollment Report," for reporting in the resultant contract. e. Inclusion of Children in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that children (defined below) must be included in all human subjects research, including, but not limited to, clinical trials, conducted under a contract funded by the NIH, unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. (See examples of Justifications for Exclusion of Children below). For the purposes of this policy, contracts involving human subjects include categories that would otherwise be exempt from the DHHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (sections 101(b) and 401(b) of 45 CFR 46), such as surveys, evaluation of educational interventions, and - 68 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

studies of existing data or specimens that should include children as participants. This policy applies to both domestic and foreign research contracts. For purposes of this policy, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. All offerors proposing research involving human subjects should read the "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research Involving Human Subjects" which was published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on March 6, 1998 and is available at the following URL address: http://www.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-024.html Offerors also may obtain copies from the contact person listed in the RFP. Inclusion of children as participants in research must be in compliance with all applicable subparts of 45 CFR 46 as well as other pertinent laws and regulations whether or not such research is otherwise exempted from 45 CFR 46. Therefore, any proposals must include a description of plans for including children, unless the offeror presents clear and convincing justification for an exclusion. The "Human Subjects" section of your technical proposal should provide either a description of the plans to include children and a rationale for selecting or excluding a specific age range of child, or an explanation of the reason(s) for excluding children as participants in the research. This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the plans for including children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research; and/or (2) the justification of exclusion of children or exclusion of a specific age range of children. When children are included, the plan also must include a description of: (1) the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included; (2) the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children; and, (3) the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Justifications for Exclusion of Children It is expected that children will be included in all research involving human subjects unless one or more of the following exclusionary circumstances can be fully justified: ˇ The objective of the solicitation is not relevant to children.
o

There are laws or regulations barring the inclusion of children in the research to be conducted under the solicitation. The knowledge being sought in the research is already available for children or will be obtained from another ongoing study, and an additional study will be redundant. You should provide documentation of other studies justifying the exclusion. A separate, age-specific study in children is warranted and preferable. Examples include: - The relative rarity of the condition in children, as compared with adults (in that extraordinary effort would be needed to include children); or - The number of children is limited because the majority are already accessed by a nationwide pediatric disease research network; or - Issues of study design preclude direct applicability of hypotheses and/ or interventions to both adults and children (including different cognitive, developmental, or disease stages of different age-related metabolic processes); or

o

- Insufficient data are available in adults to judge potential risk in children (in which case one of the research objectives could be to obtain sufficient adult data to make this judgment). While children usually should not be the initial group to be involved in research studies, in some instances, the nature and seriousness of the illness may warrant their participation earlier based on careful risk and benefit analysis; or - Study designs aimed at collecting additional data on pre-enrolled adult study subjects (e.g., longitudinal follow-up studies that did not include data on children); - Other special cases justified by the offeror and found acceptable to the review group and the Institute Director Definition of a Child For the purpose of this solicitation, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. The definition of child described above will pertain to this solicitation (notwithstanding the FDA definition of a child as an individual from infancy to 16 years of age, and varying definitions employed by some states). Generally, State laws define what constitutes a "child," and such definitions dictate whether or not a person can legally consent to participate in a research study. However, State laws vary, and many do not address when a child can consent to participate in research. Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46, subpart D, Sec.401-409) address DHHS protections for children who participate in research, and rely on State definitions of "child" for consent purposes. Consequently, the children included in this policy (persons under the age of 21) may differ in the age at which their own consent is required and sufficient to participate in research under State law. For example, some states consider a person age 18 to be an adult and therefore one who can provide consent without parental permission. Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects a. HHS Regulations at 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart C provide additional protections pertaining to biomedical and behavioral research involving prisoners or those individuals who, during the period of the contract become prisoners, as subjects. These regulations also set forth the duties of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) where prisoners are involved in the research. HHS funded research involving prisoners as subjects may not proceed until the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) issues approval, in writing, as required by 45 CFR 46.306(a)(2). In addition, OHRP Guidance on the Involvement of Prisoners in Research may be found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/prisoner.pdf. b. HHS Waiver for Epidemiological Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects On June 20, 2003 the Secretary of HHS waived the applicability of certain provisions of Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 46, (Additional DHHS Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects) to specific types of epidemiological research involving prisoners as subjects. The applicability of 45 CFR 46.305(a)(1) and 46.306(a)(2) for certain epidemiological research conducted or funded by DHHS is waived when: 1. The sole purposes are: a. to describe the prevalence or incidence of a disease by identifying all cases, or - 70 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

b. to study potential risk factor associations for a disease, and 2. The Institution responsible for the conduct of the research certifies to the OHRP that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the research and fulfilled its duties under 45 CFR 46.305(a)(2 7) and determined and documented that: a. the research presents no more than minimal risk, and b. no more than inconvenience to the prisoner subjects, and c. prisoners are not a particular focus of the research. For more information about this Waiver see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/special/ prisoners/Prisoner waiver 6-20-03.pdf f. Research Involving Human Fetal Tissue Human Fetal Tissue means tissue or cells obtained from a dead human fetus, including human embryonic stem cells, human pluripotent stem cells and human embryonic germ cells. The governing federal statute is the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g 1 and 289g 2. Implementing regulations and guidance for conducting research on human fetal tissue may be found at 45 CFR 46, Subpart B and http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/ not93-235.html and any subsequent revisions to this NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts ("Guide") Notice. By signing the face page of the proposal, the offeror (authorized institutional official) certifies that researchers using human fetal tissue are in compliance with 42 USC 289g 2. This statute specifically prohibits any person from knowingly acquiring, receiving, or transferring any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. "Valuable consideration" is a concept similar to profit, and does not include reasonable payment for costs associated with the collection processing, preservation, storage, quality control or transportation of these tissues. Research involving the transplantation of human fetal tissue must be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local law. g. Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (including Human Gene Transfer Research) Recombinant DNA Molecules are either 1) molecules that are constructed outside of living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or 2) DNA molecules that result from the replication of those described in 1). All research involving recombinant DNA molecules that is conducted at or sponsored by an entity that receives any support for recombinant DNA research from NIH shall be conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines) (See http://oba.od.nih.gov/rdna/nih_guidelines_oba.html). The NIH Guidelines stipulate biosafety and containment measures for recombinant DNA research and delineate points to consider in the development and conduct of human gene transfer clinical trials, including ethical principles and safety reporting requirements (See Appendix M of the Guidelines). More information about compliance with the NIH Guidelines can be found in a set of Frequently Asked Questions at: http://oba.od.nih.gov/ rdna_ibc/ibc_faq.html. The NIH Guidelines apply to both basic and clinical research studies.

5. Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources As a public sponsor of biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a dual interest in accelerating scientific discovery and facilitating product development. Intellectual property restrictions can stifle the broad dissemination of new discoveries and limit future avenues of research and product development. At the same time, reasonable restrictions on the dissemination of research tools are sometimes necessary to protect legitimate proprietary interests and to preserve incentives for commercial development. To assist NIH contractors achieve an appropriate balance, the NIH has provided guidance in the form of a two-part document, consisting of Principles setting forth the fundamental concepts and Guidelines that provide specific information to patent and license professionals and sponsored research administrators for implementation. The purpose of these Principles and Guidelines is to assist NIH funding recipients in determining: 1) Reasonable terms and conditions for making NIH-funded research resources available to scientists in other institutions in the public and private sectors (disseminating research tools); and 2) Restrictions to accept as a condition of receiving access to research tools for use in NIH-funded research (acquiring research tools). The intent is to help recipients ensure that the conditions they impose and accept on the transfer of research tools will facilitate further biomedical research, consistent with the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act and NIH funding policy. This policy, entitled, "Sharing Biomedical Research Resources: Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts," (Federal Register Notice, December 23, 1999 [64 FR 72090] will be included in any contract awarded from this solicitation. It can be found at the following website: http://ott.od.nih.gov/pdfs/64FR72090.pdf a. Sharing Research Data Note: This policy applies to all NIH contracts, regardless of dollar value, that are expected to generate research data. The NIH endorses the sharing of final research data to expedite the translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. This contract is expected to generate research data. Therefore, the offeror must submit a plan in its technical proposal for data sharing or state why data sharing is not possible. If data sharing is limited, the offeror should explain such limitations in its data sharing plan. NIH's data sharing policy may be found at the following Web site: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html 6. Information and Physical Access Security is applicable to this solicitation and the following information is provided to assist in proposal preparation. IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following information shall be addressed in a separate section of the Business Proposal entitled "Information Security." The Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) (FISMA) requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to safeguard information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor (including subcontractor), or other source.

Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, Section 508 Compliance is applicable to this solicitation and the following information is provided to assist in proposal preparation. IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following information shall be addressed in a separate section of the Technical Proposal, entitled, "Section 508 Compliance." Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, HHSAR 352.239-73(a) (January 2010) a. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit-i. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and ii. Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access - 84 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. b. Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotations/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 visions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/ provisions.htm. c. The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in Article C.2. Reporting Requirements and Article H.15. Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, HHSAR 352.239-73(b) (January 2010). In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site ( http:// www.hhs.gov/od/). d. Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government -- i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense. (End of provision) The "HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template" is included in SECTION J - List of Attachments, of this solicitation. c. BUSINESS PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS 1.

(End of provision) 5. Salary Rate Limitation in Fiscal Year 2013 Offerors are advised that pursuant to P.L. **, no NIH Fiscal Year 2013 (October 1, 2012 - September 30, 2013) funds may be used to pay the direct annual salary of an individual through any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation at a rate in excess of the Executive Schedule, Level II* (direct salary is exclusive of Overhead, Fringe Benefits and General and Administrative expenses, also referred to as "indirect cost" or "facilities and administrative (F&A) costs"). Direct salary has the same meaning as the term "institutional base salary." An individual's direct salary (or institutional base salary) is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care or other activities. Direct salary (or institutional base salary) excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. This does not preclude the offeror from absorbing that portion of an employee's annual salary (plus the dollar amount for fringe benefits and associated indirect costs) that exceeds a rate of the Executive Schedule, Level II*. The salary rate limitation set by P.L ** applies only to Fiscal Year 2013 funds, however, salary rate ceilings for subsequent years may be included in future DHHS appropriation acts. Multi-year contracts awarded pursuant to this solicitation may be subject to

- 88 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

unilateral modifications by the Government if an individual's annual salary exceeds any salary rate ceiling established in future appropriations acts. The Executive Schedule, Level II* annual salary rate limitation also applies to individuals proposed under subcontracts, however it does not apply to consultants. P.L .** states: "None of the funds appropriated in this title shall be used to pay the salary of an individual through a grant or other extramural mechanism, at a rate in excess of Executive Level II." LINK TO EXECUTIVE SCHEDULE RATES OF PAY: http://www.opm.gov/oca/ (For current year rates, click on Salaries and Wages/Executive Schedule/Rates of Pay for the Executive Schedule. For prior year rates, click on Salaries and Wages/select Another Year at the top of the page/Executive Schedule/Rates of Pay for the Executive Schedule. Rates are effective January 1 of each calendar year unless otherwise noted.) *Note to Offerors: The current Fiscal Year Executive Level II Salary Rate shall be adhered to in the preparation of your proposal. All costs associated with any resultant contract award shall be in compliance with the current Fiscal Year Executive Level II Salary rates. ** Pending passage of legislation. 6.

The amount of credit provided by the Contracting Officer to a mentor firm for protégé firm developmental assistance costs shall be calculated on a dollar for dollar basis and reported by the mentor firm in the Summary Subcontract Report via the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) at http://www.esrs.gov. The mentor firm and protégé firm shall submit to the Contracting Officer a signed joint statement agreeing on the dollar value of the developmental assistance the mentor firm provided.

9. Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.304(c)(4), the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns in performance of the contract in the authorized NAICS Industry Subsectors shall be evaluated in unrestricted competitive acquisitions expected to exceed $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) subject to certain limitations (see FAR 19.1202-1 and 19.1202-2(b). The dollar amounts cited above include any option years/option quantities that may be included in this solicitation. The definition of a "small disadvantaged business" is cited in FAR 19.001. The factor entitled "Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation" as set forth in Section M Evaluation Factors for Award shall be used for evaluation purposes. The Department of Commerce determines, on an annual basis, by Subsectors, as contained in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and region, if any, the authorized SDB procurement mechanisms and applicable factors (percentages). The NAICS codes can be found at: http://www.sba.gov/size The Department of Commerce website for the annual determination for NAICS codes* is: http://www.acquisition.gov/References/sdbadjustments.htm. * Note: Public Law 103-355 which authorized the SDB Price Evaluation Adjustment (PEA) and associated percentages/factors expired on December 9, 2004, therefore, the percentages shown at this website are no longer applicable. Offerors shall include with their offers, SDB targets, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract value, in each of the applicable, authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s). The applicable authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s) for this project is (are) identified elsewhere in this RFP. A total target for SDB participation by the Prime Contractor, that includes any joint ventures and team members, shall be provided as well as a total target for SDB participation by subcontractors. In addition, offerors must provide information that describes their plans for meeting the targets set forth in their proposal. This information shall be provided in one clearly marked section of the Business Proposal, which shall describe the extent of participation of SDB concerns in the performance of the contract. If the evaluation factor in this solicitation includes an SDB evaluation factor or subfactor that considers the extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified, the SDB concerns considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any resultant contract. Offerors should note that addressing the extent of small disadvantaged business participation is not in any way intended to be a substitute for submission of the subcontracting plan, if it is required by this solicitation. An example of the type of information that might be given (in addition to the narrative describing the plan for meeting the targets) follows: EXAMPLE Targets for SDB Participation - NAICS Industry Subsector 223 SDB Percentage of Total Contract Value Total Contract 25% Value- $1,000,000 SDB Participation 10% by Prime (Includes joint venture partners and team arrangements)* SDB Participation by subcontractors 15% $150,000 $250,000 $100,000 SDB Dollars

*Note: FAR Subpart 9.6 defines "Contractor team arrangements" to include two or more companies forming a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential Prime Contractor, or a potential Prime Contractor who agrees with one or more companies to have them act as its subcontractors on a specific contract or acquisition program. For purposes of evaluation of the SDB participation factor, FAR 19.1202-4 requires that SDB joint ventures and teaming arrangements at the prime level be presented separately from SDB participation by subcontractors. 10. Total Compensation Plan

a.

Instructions 1. Total compensation (salary and fringe benefits) of professional employees under service contracts may, in some cases, be lowered by recompetition of these contracts. Lowering of compensation can be detrimental in obtaining the necessary quality of professional services needed for adequate performance of service contracts. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR Part 541, be properly compensated in these contracts. All offerors as a part of their Business Proposal will submit a "Total Compensation Plan" (salaries and fringe benefits) for these professional employees for evaluation purposes. 2. The Government will evaluate the Total Compensation Plan to ensure that this compensation reflects a sound management approach and an understanding of the requirements to be performed. It will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted work of high quality. The total compensation proposed will be evaluated in terms of enhancing recruitment and retention of personnel and its realism and consistency with a total plan for compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits). 3. Evaluation for award, therefore, will include an assessment of the Total Compensation Plan submitted by each offeror.

b. Evaluation 1. Total Compensation Plan (Professional Employees) In establishing compensation levels for professional employees, the total compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits) proposed shall reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the work to be accomplished and the suitability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and retain qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must recognize the distinct differences in professional skills and the complexity of varied disciplines as well as job difficulty. Proposals offering total compensation levels less than currently being paid by the predecessor Contractor for the same work will be evaluated, in addition to the above, on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted work of high quality, and availability of required competent professional employees. Offerors are cautioned that instances of lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may be considered a lack of sound management judgment in addition to indicating a lack of understanding of the requirement. 2. Cost (Professional Compensation) Proposals which are unrealistically low or do not reflect a reasonable relationship of compensation to the professional job categories so as to impair the Contractor's ability to recruit and retain competent professional employees, may be viewed as reflecting a failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements. The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. The compensation data required will be used in evaluation of the offeror's understanding of the contract requirements.

3. Other (Labor Relations) An assessment of the potential for adverse effect upon performance and maintenance of the required number of professional employees with requisite skills resulting from an unrealistically low compensation structure will also be made. 4. Federal Acquisition Regulation Clauses incorporated by Reference FAR Clause 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees. 11. Other Administrative Data a. Property 1. It is HHS policy that Contractors will provide all property necessary for contract performance. Exception may be granted to provide Government property (Government-furnished or Contractor-acquired), but only when approved by the Contracting Officer. If the offeror requests that Government property be provided, other than that specified under "Government Furnished Property," below , the proposal must include a comprehensive justification addressing the following items: a. State why the property is essential to contract performance and whether the property will be used exclusively for this contract. b. Describe other alternatives (e.g., purchase, lease, etc.) pursued and why they were not viable options. 2.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
1. GENERAL Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against four factors. The factors in order of importance are: technical, cost, past performance and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) participation. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, past performance, cost/price and SDB participation are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government intends to make an award(s) to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the SOLICITATION. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the SOLICITATION. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below. 2. COST/PRICE EVALUATION Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. Cost Realism: The specific elements of each offeror(s) proposed costs are realistic when the proposed cost elements are evaluated and found to: 1) be realistic for the work to be performed; 2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and 3) be consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror(s) technical proposal. Cost Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost to perform the contract in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision. 3. HUMAN SUBJECT EVALUATION This research project involves human subjects. NIH Policy requires: a. Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks The offeror's proposal must address the involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation, or provide sufficient information on the research subjects to allow a determination by NIAID that a designated exemption is appropriate. If you claim that this research should be considered exempt from coverage by the Federal Regulations at 45 CFR 46, the proposal should address why you believe it is exempt, and under which exemption it applies. The reviewers will evaluate the proposal with regard to four issues: Risks to Human Subjects, Adequacy of Protection Against Risks, Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others, and Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained. See Section L for a complete discussion of what is required to be addressed for each of these issues. Based on the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., concerns are identified as to the protections described against risk to human subjects or no discussion is found regarding protections - 99 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

against risk to human subjects) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the protection of human subjects from research risks is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. b. Women and Minorities Women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be included in the study population of research involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification are provided indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. In addition, for NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trials, all proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/ women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm , Definitions - Significant Difference) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable, unless the Government has specified that this solicitation involves a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. The proposal also must include one of the following plans: ˇ Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups (representation of sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups as subject selection criterion is not required; however, inclusion and analyses are encouraged), OR ˇ Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Also, the proposal must address the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as participants. Reviewers will consider the areas covered here and in Section L of the solicitation in narrative form in their evaluation. Some of the issues they will evaluate include: ˇ whether the plan proposed includes minorities and both genders in adequate representation ˇ how the offeror addresses the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in the development of a proposal that is appropriate to the scientific objectives of the solicitation ˇ the description of the proposed study populations in terms of sex/gender and racial/ethnic groups and the rationale for selection of such subjects ˇ if exclusion is proposed, that the rationale is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or to the purpose of the research.

- 100 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

ˇ In addition, for gender exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if it is because:
o

the purpose of the research constrains the offeror's selection of study participants by gender (e.g., uniquely valuable stored specimens or existing datasets are single gender; very small numbers of subjects are involved; or overriding factors dictate selection of subjects); or gender representation of specimens or existing datasets cannot be accurately determined, and this does not compromise the scientific objectives of the research.

o o

ˇ For minority group exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if those minority groups are excluded because:
o o

inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to their health; or inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research.

ˇ For NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials, reviewers will also consider whether there is an adequate description of plans to conduct analyses to detect significant differences of clinical or public health importance in intervention effect(s) by sex/gender and/or racial ethnic subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is expected in the primary analyses, or if there is an adequate description of plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is not expected in the primary analyses. If you determine that inclusion of women and minority populations is not feasible, you must submit a detailed rationale and justification for exclusion of one or both groups from the study population with the technical proposal. The Government will review the rationale to determine if it is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or the purpose of the research Based on the evaluation of the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed gender/minority inclusion plans, or concerns are identified as to the gender or minority representation, or the proposal does not adequately address limited representation of one gender or minority; or the plan is not in accordance with NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of women/minorities inclusion. If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion/ exclusion of women and minorities is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. c. Children Children (i.e. individuals under the age of 21) must be included in all human subject research unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. Your proposal must include a description of plans for including children. If you plan to exclude children from the required research, your proposal must present an acceptable justification for the exclusion. If you determine that exclusion of a specific age range of child is appropriate, your proposal must also address the rationale for such exclusion. Also, the plan must include a description of the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included, of the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children, and the inclusion of a - 101 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Also, see Section L of the solicitation for further specific requirements on inclusion of children. Based on the reviewers' evaluation of the offeror's response, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed inclusion plans for children; or concerns are identified as to the offeror's response regarding the inclusion of children; or the plan is not in accordance wit h NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion of children is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. 4. EVALUATION OF OPTIONS It is anticipated that any contract awarded from this solicitation will contain option provision(s) and period(s). In accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, (July 1990), the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 5. EVALUATION OF DATA SHARING PLAN The offeror's plan for the sharing of final research data shall be assessed for appropriateness and adequacy. If your proposal does not include a plan or if the plan in your proposal is considered "unacceptable," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify your data sharing plan during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your data sharing plan is still considered "unacceptable" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. 6. TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS The evaluation factors are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing the technical proposals. The factors below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes. Subfactors are considered to be of equal importance.

TOTAL WEIGHT 100

7. EVALUATION OF ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY - SECTION 508 The offeror's proposal must demonstrate compliance with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194 for all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports. If your proposal does not include a completed HHS "Section 508 Product Assessment Template" (hereafter referred to as the "Template") which demonstrates that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, or, if the completed "Template" included in your proposal is considered "noncompliant," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify the "Template" during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your "Template" is still considered "noncompliant" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. 8. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR Offerors' past performance information will be evaluated prior to establishment of the competitive range. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation - 104 -

RFP Number : NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150

for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. 9. EXTENT OF SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION SDB participation will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall commitment and realism of the offeror's SDB Participation targets will be used in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered to offer the best value to the Government. The extent of the offeror's Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Targets will be evaluated before determination of the competitive range. Evaluation of SDB participation will be assessed based on consideration of the information presented in the offeror's proposal. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform. Offers will be evaluated on the following sub-factors: a. Extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified b. Extent of commitment to use SDB concerns c. Complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform d. Realism of the proposal e. Past performance of offerors in complying with subcontracting plan goals for SDB concerns and monetary targets for SDB participation f. Extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition.

STATEMENT OF WORK IMMUNOLOGY QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM RFP-NIAID-DAIDS-NIHAI2012150 1) BACKGROUND and INTRODUCTION: The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies. Reliable laboratory data are important for the meaningful interpretation of therapeutic and prevention clinical trials/studies and for the appropriate management of subjects enrolled in these studies. Immunological tests, as well as storage of frozen peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMC) for future testing/study, are included in many NIAIDsupported clinical trials. It is, therefore, important to evaluate objectively the ability of laboratories to process PBMC and perform tests reliably, and to enhance laboratory performance by providing assistance and training if deficiencies are identified. The purpose of the Immunology Quality Assessment Program (IQA) is to assess the ability of laboratories located both in the United States (U.S.) and outside (non-U.S.) to accurately and reliably determine CD4 and CD8 T cell lymphocyte counts and percentages and the ability of laboratories to correctly freeze viable PBMC. The IQA provides assistance and training when laboratories have difficulties. The IQA facilitates the adaptation, standardization and quality assessment of new immunological assay methodologies for use in NIAID supported investigations with particular focus on novel, simple tests (point-of-care) for diagnosis and disease monitoring. With the increased research emphasis on T cell activation and inflammation in HIV disease, as well as the study of vaccines in pediatric populations, the IQA shall provide assistance to laboratories to standardize research-use-only tests and design measures to ensure quality and reliability. The history of this Program is as follows: 1988 ­ 1993 Initial award to FAST Systems Inc., Gaithersburg, MD 1993 ­ 1998 Award to FAST Systems Inc., Gaithersburg, MD 1998 ­ 2007 Award to the University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey, Newark, NJ 2007 ­ 2014 Award to Duke University, Durham, NC Contract No. HHSN272200700054C. The IQA shall serve current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups). Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), the International Maternal Pediatric and Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), and the HIV Microbicide Trials Network (MTN), as well as individual grantees conducting research in and outside the U.S.

2) SCOPE: The Contractor shall provide support to: (1) evaluate the ability of U.S. and non-U.S. laboratories (Labs) to accurately and reliably perform study-specified immunological tests and viable PBMC freezing; (2) advise and train Lab staff when deficiencies are identified; (3) evaluate immunology-based novel technologies for implementation in multi-site NIAID clinical trials, and (4) host and maintain an electronic data management system and document library in support of contract activities. 3) TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed, to perform the Statement of Work below. Specifically, the Contractor shall: A. IMPLEMENT LAB PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND ASSESS LAB PERFORMANCE 1. Proficiency Testing (PT) of Immunological Assays When Labs are chosen by User Groups to participate in a clinical trial, it is critical to evaluate, both initially and on an on-going basis, the ability of Labs to perform protocol-specified tests correctly and reliably. The Contractor determines proficiency by evaluating results obtained with panels of coded (unknown to Labs) Quality Control Materials (QCMs) [Note: Section C provides further information on QCMs]. Panels of QCMs are tested by the Labs at regular intervals. Examples of tests that may be monitored for testing proficiency include flow cytometric evaluations of CD4 and CD8 T cell lymphocyte counts and percentages as well as their subsets (e.g., CD45RO, CD27, CD28, HLADR, CD38) and determination of serum/plasma levels of various cytokines (e.g., 71),)1 IL-6) and chemokines (e.g., MIP-0,3- For each assay specified by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), the Contractor shall perform the following tasks: a. Provide participating Labs with PT panels of coded QCMs at intervals specified by the COR. Panels shall include QCMs that correspond to the clinical samples used in each assay (e.g., plasma, serum, PBMC). b. In collaboration with investigators and statisticians identified by the COR, design new or implement currently available tools to capture assay results and information related to the methodology and instrumentation at the Labs. c. Provide Labs with instructions regarding: i) proper use of QCMs in assays; ii) storage of QCMs at the Lab; and iii) method, format and deadline of PT performance and result reporting. The Contractor shall provide electronic means for retrieval of results whenever the possibility to do so exists. Retrieve results from the Labs after completion of each round of testing.

d. Verify the accuracy and completeness of data received from Labs. Discuss the PT results with the COR, and others designated by the COR, in conference calls. e. Within 10 business days after all PT results are obtained from Labs and the data set is closed, analyze results and determine successful performance based on criteria formulated by the Contractor, relevant Study Groups and the COR. This shall require basic and advanced statistical analyses of data, including parametric and non-parametric approaches. f. Within 5 business days after completion of the statistical analysis and determination of level of performance, provide each participating Lab with its own Lab-specific performance report. These reports must be provided prior to shipping the next round of proficiency testing.

g. After each round of PT, prepare and submit to the COR and User Groups a Cumulative Performance Report delineating performance status of all Labs over time. 2. Assessment of Non-U.S. CD4 Flow Cytometry Laboratories To monitor the performance of Non-U.S. CD4 flow cytometry Labs that support DAIDS-funded clinical studies, it is necessary to obtain proficiency testing panels comprised of stabilized materials that can withstand shipments longer than 24 hours. The United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS) - www.ukneqasli.org is a provider of such panels. Non-U.S. CD4 laboratories are currently expected to participate in the UK NEQAS CD4 PT program, which periodically ships to Labs panels of coded PT samples and issues each Lab with its own Lab-specific performance report. The UK NEQAS provides the IQA with access to its database to retrieve Labs performance results. NonU.S. flow cytometry Labs are located mostly in resource limited countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The Contractor shall perform the following: a. As directed by the COR, directly ship, or coordinate the shipments of, a UKNEQAS qualification panel of stabilized whole-blood coded samples to new Labs to assess their initial ability to perform CD4 enumeration. Analyze results received from Labs and determine performance. As directed by the COR, pay for the qualification panels and their shipment to Labs. b. Facilitate the enrollment of new Labs identified by the COR into the UK NEQAS CD4 Proficiency Testing Program. This shall require sending an existing method/capability survey to each new lab, receiving the completed survey and communicating with the UK NEQAS to request enrollment. As directed by the COR, pay for the PT panels and their shipment to Labs. c. Access the UK NEQAS database to review proficiency testing results of each PT round and/or review Lab-specific performance reports produced by the UK NEQAS. d. After each round of PT, prepare and submit to the COR and User Groups a Cumulative Performance Report delineating the performance status of all Labs over time. STATEMENT OF WORK March 15, 2013 Page 3 of 12 ATTACHMENT 3

e. Evaluate the adequacy of in-country PT programs for CD4 as possible substitutes for the UKNEQAS program. IQA monitoring of Lab performance in these PT programs shall not result in increased costs to the contract. 3. Proficiency Testing (PT) of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) Cryopreservation DAIDS clinical studies often include immunological testing, such as ELISPOT, Intracellular Cytokine (ICC) determinations and T cell subset immunophenotyping, designed to be performed on frozen samples from subjects enrolled in these studies. Because such samples must contain sufficient numbers of viable Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), it is important to assess the ability of Labs to adequately process, viably freeze, and ship PBMC. The Contractor shall perform the following: a. Provide Labs with instructions for processing and viable freezing PBMC at the lab and their shipping to the IQA. Also provide data forms and/or electronic means for capturing viability and yield at the Lab prior to freezing. b. Receive frozen samples from Labs at intervals specified by the COR. c. Upon receipt, store frozen samples from Labs in liquid nitrogen for a period of time specified by the COR, thaw and determine viability and yield, analyze results and determine performance success based on criteria formulated by the Contractor and User Groups. d. Provide each Lab with its own Lab-specific performance report prior to receipt of the next round of PT samples. e. After each round of PT, prepare and submit to the COR and User Groups a Cumulative Performance Report delineating performance status of all Labs over time. 4. ASSIST, GUIDE AND TRAIN LABS TO IMPROVE LABORATORY OPERATIONS Training for commercially available assays is generally provided by the manufacturer. Where training is not provided by a manufacturer, the Contractor shall assist in training Lab personnel. Additionally, when Lab proficiency testing results deviate from accepted values agreed upon by the Contractor, User Group and the COR, the Contractor shall provide assistance to Labs to prevent poor performance from reoccurring. The Contractor shall also provide guidance to Labs when there is concern about results obtained with subjects enrolled in DAIDS-supported clinical studies. The Contractor shall use available methods such as telephone, email, and web conferencing to effectively communicate with the Labs to provide assistance and training. The Contractor shall perform the following: a. Provide Labs with procedures/Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for performing immunologic assays and PBMC processing, as well as instructions for validating instruments, when Labs newly enroll in the IQA programs and whenever procedures are updated by the manufacturers, Contractor, or User STATEMENT OF WORK March 15, 2013 Page 4 of 12 ATTACHMENT 3

Groups. As directed by the COR, when new assays are developed, prepare training materials for the new assays (e.g. assay procedures/SOPs, instructional videos, diagrams and pictures), and make training materials available to Labs on the IQA document library. See section 3.D. b. Send Labs with poor performance an Investigation Report Form to initiate an investigation of the root causes of performance failure and steps for corrective action. The contractor shall use existing Investigation Report Forms or develop such forms for new assays. c. Review corrective action plans from the Labs and assist with implementation of the plans. d. Request and review additional materials (e.g. histograms, list-mode data, additional aliquots of frozen PBMC, Standard Operating Procedures, and the Sites' quality management and corrective action plans) to further investigate the sources and magnitude of difficulties. e. As needed, after implementation of corrective measures, provide Labs with QCM panels, or receive frozen samples from Labs, for re-testing; analyze data from the additional panels and report results to Labs, User Groups and COR. f. Recommend to the COR the planning and conduct of visits to Labs to provide training and guidance based on Lab-specific needs/performance. Upon COR approval to conduct a Lab visit, submit to the COR a written plan providing relevant information including visit purpose/goals, duration, existing materials to be provided and/or new materials requiring preparation, names of visiting contract staff, and budget estimate. Within 10 business days of visit completion, prepare a report delineating observations, activities conducted, resolution of needs/problems and any recommended future plans for additional site-specific guidance/training. Distribute the report to the visited Lab, User Groups and the COR.

g. At the request of the COR, make arrangements for visits to the Contractor by Lab personnel for the purpose of training. h. At the request of the COR, provide training at investigator meetings and regional training events. i. Obtain COR pre-approval of training materials at least 3 business days prior to the date of presentation.

B. EVALUATE IMMUNOLOGY-BASED TECHNOLOGIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN CLINICAL TRIALS To ensure the continued development and harmonization of immunological assays for HIV and related co-pathogens, especially low-cost simple technologies, and their application in vaccine, prevention and therapeutic studies, the Contractor shall conduct studies to optimize new or existing immunologic methodologies, and investigate and integrate biostatistical methodologies for the evaluation and interpretation of laboratory data.

and

Software

Design

The overall IQA system was developed as an integrated, centralized, web-based system to automate operations of a laboratory supporting IQA services. This system enables the IQA to perform, share, and report on science, and interact with numerous laboratory sites located around the world in a secure, compliant, and efficient manner. The system provides the capability to track IQA activities, shipping of specimens to global locations, and provide real time inventory of cells, serum, plasma, etc., used to support the IQA program. The IQA system also manages the uploading of testing data from participating laboratories, enables sharing of stored data and statistical analyses, tracks protocol deviations and trend analysis of laboratory performance. The system is web-enabled via secure web servers using SSL (https) and VPN. The web and network architecture allows for numerous simultaneous connections and transactions. Current IQA system platform: Application: Ruby on Rails Web/Application Servers: Apache/Linux (RHEL 64-bit) Dell R610 (2), RAM: 4GB, CPU: 2-2.66 GHz; Hard Drives 2-146GB RAID 1 Database Servers: Oracle/Linux (RHEL 64-bit) Dell R710 (2), RAM 8GB, CPU: 2-2.66 GHz; Hard Drives 2-146GB RAID 1; 4-300GB RAID 5 Development/Test Server: Apache/Linux (RHEL 64-bit) Dell R610 (1), RAM: 4GB, CPU: 2-2.66 GHz; Hard Drives 2-146GB RAID 1

HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template
Purpose: This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human Services

Background: In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508. The result of their collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template ­ a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not meet the various Section 508 Requirements.

How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized: This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables. The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Section 508 Standards. Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a Section 508 Standard is composed of. It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not comply with a specific requirement. Understanding the columns Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template's tables: Summary Table Column Name Criteria: Supporting Features: Use Describes Subparts B, C, and D of the Section 508 Standards. Enter information summarizing a product's overall "level-of support" for the corresponding Subpart or, when appropriate, to specify Not Applicable. DO NOT ENTER REMARKS OR EXPLANATIONS IN THIS COLUMN. Enter general comments regarding a product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Applicable Subpart. Section 1194.xx Tables Use Describes a specific guideline that a Subpart is composed of. Enter information summarizing a product's "level-of-support" for a specific guideline.

What information do I enter in columns 2 and 3? The Supporting Features and Remarks/Explanations columns are used to document exactly how a product did or did not meet the Section 508 Standards. Supporting Features (second column on 508 Evaluation Template) Language What It Means... Supports Product FULLY meets the letter and intent of the Criteria. Product does not ENTIRELY meet the letter and intent of the Criteria, but does provide some level of access. Product provides alternative methods to meet the intent of the Criteria. Product does not meet the letter or intent of the Criteria. The Criteria does not apply to the product.

Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template: To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company's technical specialist for the product being sought for purchase. HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses. Once you have enlisted their assistance: 1) Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C ­ 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D ­ 1194.41) sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template. 2) For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements. 3) Using the information found in the How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.
x x If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support the standard. If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability. If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly how the product did not meet the standard.

x

4) Once documented in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how the product did or did not meet, return to the Summary Table and document the product's overall "level-of-conformance" in each of the applicable sections. 5) Post the final Section 508 Evaluation Template on your company's web site or on the GSA Buy Accessible Wizard. 6) It is the Vendor's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data on the Section 508 Evaluation Template. The information provided on the Section 508 Evaluation Template is considered a self-representation unless expressly affirmed otherwise. Even so, HHS uses this form to complete required Market Research associated with the agency complying with Section 508 and may use the form to eliminate this product compared to other more accessible products that meet the HHS business needs.

* Please Note:
x x x

Any WEB application being purchased by HHS also requires the Vendor to complete Section 1194.21 of the Section 508 Evaluation Template in addition to Sections 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41.

HHS reserves the right to reject a PAT and corresponding proposal/offering if the answers do not address the standards. HHS needs the PAT to address the standards in order to evaluate it for conformance. Please answer honestly and be prepared to work with HHS to improve accessibility for your product if it is purchased. Submission of this documentation constitutes a warrant on behalf of the vendor of the conformance of their product. Remediation of a product or service to the specified conformance shall be the responsibility of the vendor.

Your company has established and used such procedures: ________ yes _________ no 9. Description of Good Faith Effort Maximum practicable utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.

In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take. These steps will be negotiated with the contracting official prior to approval of the plan. ____________________________________________________________________

INVOICE/FINANCING REQUEST AND CONTRACT FINANCIAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR NIH COST-REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS, NIH(RC)-4 Format: Submit payment requests on the Contractor's self-generated form in the manner and format prescribed herein and as illustrated in the Sample Invoice/Financing Request. Standard Form 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, may be used in lieu of the Contractor's self-generated form provided it contains all of the information shown on the Sample Invoice/Financing Request. DO NOT include a cover letter with the payment request. Number of Copies: Submit payment requests in the quantity specified in the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule. Frequency: Payment requests shall not be submitted more frequently than once every two weeks in accordance with the Allowable Cost and Payment Clause incorporated into this contract. Small business concerns may submit invoices/financing requests more frequently than every two weeks when authorized by the Contracting Office. Cost Incurrence Period: Costs incurred must be within the contract performance period or covered by precontract cost provisions. Billing of Costs Incurred: : If billed costs include (1) costs of a prior billing period, but not previously billed, or (2) costs incurred during the contract period and claimed after the contract period has expired, the Contractor shall cite the amount(s) and month(s) in which the costs were incurred. Contractor's Fiscal Year: Prepare payment requests in such a manner that the Government can identify costs claimed with the Contractor's fiscal year. Currency: All NIH contracts are expressed in United States dollars. When the Government pays in a currency other than United States dollars, billings shall be expressed, and payment by the Government shall be made, in that other currency at amounts coincident with actual costs incurred. Currency fluctuations may not be a basis of gain or loss to the Contractor. Notwithstanding the above, the total of all invoices paid under this contract shall not exceed the United States dollars authorized. Costs Requiring Prior Approval: Identify and reference the Contracting Officer's Authorization (COA) Number for costs requiring the Contracting Officer's approval, which are not set forth in an Advance Understanding in the contract. In addition, the Contractor shall show any cost set forth in an Advance Understanding as a separate entry under the appropriate expenditure category on the payment request. Invoice/Financing Request Identification: Identify each payment as either: (a) Interim Invoice/Contract Financing Request: These are interim payment requests submitted during the contract performance period. (b) Completion Invoice: Submit the completion invoice promptly upon completion of the work, but no later than one year from the contract completion date, or within 120 days after settlement of the final indirect cost rates covering the year in which the contract is physically complete (whichever date is later). The Contractor shall submit the completion invoice when all costs have been assigned to the contract and all performance provisions have been completed.

Page 1 of 7
NIH(RC)-4 Rev. 8/2012 ATTACHMENT 18

(c) Final Invoice: A final invoice may be required after the amounts owed have been settled between the Government and the Contractor (e.g., resolution of all suspensions and audit exceptions). Preparation and Itemization of the Invoice/Financing Request: The Contractor shall furnish the information set forth in the instructions below. The instructions are keyed to the entries on the Sample Invoice/Financing Request. All information must be legible or the invoice will be considered improper and returned to the Contractor. (a) Designated Billing Office Name and Address: Enter the designated billing office name and address, as identified in the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule. (b) Contractor's Name, Address, Point of Contact, TIN, and DUNS or DUNS+4 Number: Show the Contractor's name and address exactly as they appear in the contract. Any invoice identified as improper will be sent to this address. Also include the name, title, phone number, and email address of the Point of Contact in case of questions. If the remittance name differs from the legal business name, both names must appear on the invoice. Provide the Contractor's Federal Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) or DUNS+4 number. The DUNS number must identify the Contractor's name and address exactly as stated in the contract, and as registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. When an approved assignment of claims has been executed, the Contractor shall provide the same information for the assignee as is required for the Contractor (i.e., name, address, point of contact, TIN, and DUNS number), with the remittance information clearly identified as such. (c) Invoice/Financing Request Number: Identify each payment request by a unique invoice number, which can only be used one time regardless of the number of contracts or orders held by an organization. For example, if a contractor has already submitted invoice number 05 on one of its contracts or orders, it cannot use that same invoice number on any other contract or order. Payment requests with duplicate invoice numbers will be considered improper and returned to the contractor. The NIH does not prescribe a particular numbering format but suggests using a job or account number for each contract and order followed by a sequential invoice number (example: 8675309-05). Invoice numbers are limited to 30 characters. There are no restrictions on the use of special characters, such as colons, dashes, forward slashes, or parentheses. If all or part of an invoice is suspended and the contractor chooses to reclaim those costs on a supplemental invoice, the contractor may use the same unique invoice number followed by an alpha character, such as "R" for revised (example: 8675309-05R). (d) Date Invoice/Financing Request Prepared: Insert the date the payment request is prepared. (e) Contract Number and Order Number (if applicable): Insert the contract number and order number (if applicable). (f) Contract Title: Insert the contract title exactly as it appears on the cover page of the contract.

Owned by each federal agency to cover their internal records (e.g., HHS, NIH and other OPDIVs); 2. Often referred to as "umbrella" system notices; 3. National Institutes of Health SORNs begin with 09-25-xxxx; and 4. Department of Health & Human Services SORNs begin 09-90-xxxx. Government Notices: 1. All federal agencies may use these notices to cover government-wide record systems (e.g., OPM, OGE, EEOC, FEMA, GSA, etc.); 2. The physical records contained within the record system belong to the respective federal agency; 3. OPM still retains some authority over the records, e.g., during an appeal process; and 4. Notices begin with GOVT-1, 2, etc. Central Notices: 1. Owned by OPM who maintains full responsibility for the central record systems (e.g., Personnel Investigations Records); 2. Federal agencies are permitted to maintain copies; and 3. Notices begin with CENTRAL-1, 2, etc. Listed below are the Privacy Act Systems of Records Notices most commonly referenced within NIH for its record systems: NIH Internal Systems 09-25-0005, Administration: Library Operations and NIH Library User I.D.
