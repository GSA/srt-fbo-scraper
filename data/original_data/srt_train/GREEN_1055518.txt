                                                             Collaborative workspace
                                                                   APPLICATION


1.0   Background
FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and
eliminating unnecessary human exposure to man-made radiation from medical, occupational and consumer products. There are thousands of types of
medical devices, from heart pacemakers to contact lenses. Radiation-emitting products regulated by FDA include microwave ovens, video display
terminals, and medical ultrasound and x-ray machines. The center accomplishes its mission by:
    • reviewing requests to research or market medical devices
    • collecting, analyzing, and acting on information about injuries and other experiences in the use of medical devices and radiation-emitting
      electronic products
    • setting and enforcing good manufacturing practice regulations and performance standards for radiation-emitting electronic products and
      medical devices
    • monitoring compliance and surveillance programs for medical devices and radiation-emitting electronic products
    • providing technical and other nonfinancial assistance to small manufacturers of medical devices.
CDRH is taking steps to increase its ability to identify, analyze, and act on postmarket information in order to improve the safety and
effectiveness of medical devices and radiation-emitting products. In January, 2006 the Center convened a senior leadership team (the Postmarket
Transformation Leadership Team-PTLT) which included external medical device experts.  The team’s charge was to "evaluate the recommendations in
the CDRH document, “Ensuring the Safety of Marketed Medical Devices – Executive Synopsis and Recommendations,” (January ’06), collect additional
data as necessary, supplement the recommendations, if needed, and propose a prioritized implementation plan for a transformed postmarket
process".

The report recommendations elaborated the four areas designated for improvement in the previous postmarket reports.  They are:

    • Create a Culture of Collaboration
    • Develop World Class Data Systems
    • Enhance Risk/Benefit Communication Efforts
    • Collaborate on Enforcement Strategies and Outcomes


1.1   Create a Culture of Collaboration
The Center’s goal in creating a culture of collaboration is to operate CDRH as a coordinated whole, rather than a collection of pieces.  The
Center is transforming its operations by adding a permanent matrix of cross-cutting product-related groups over the current functionally-based
organizational structure to foster information sharing, collaboration and, ultimately, more effective public health promotion and protection.
The cross-cutting matrix is designed to ensure that collaboration occurs not just in crisis situations, but also as a part of routine, day-to-
day operations.
Additionally, the Center must ensure that everyone understands the value and meaning of true collaboration.  We are establishing an
organizational culture in which it is expected that communication is open and honest, that all key stakeholders are consulted early in a
decision so that the right decision can be made the first time, and that people are empowered to lead effectively and efficiently.  A matrix
structure that overlays “horizontal” product-focused Networks over our “vertical” regulatory Office systems can, with strong leadership,
facilitate our transformation to a collaborative organization. 
The matrix overlay and the establishment and fostering of an organizational culture that encourages collaboration are key initiatives of
postmarket transformation.  However, these initiatives depend on a supporting technology environment that enables, among other things, the flow
of information, the identification of expertise, social (professional) networking, the ability to connect disparate information sources and
“findability”.  Such an environment does not currently exist at FDA/CDRH, and it is this environment that is the focus of the scope section
below.
CDRH is looking for capabilities in two broad areas, and this statement of work covers one of those – collaborative workspace.
2.0   Scope
CDRH is seeking a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) collaborative workspace application as one of the key enablers for its matrix structure and in
support of developing a culture of collaboration.  The actual software is a very small, but critical piece, of these efforts.  CDRH has
identified the mandatory and desirable requirements of a collaborative workspace that will be of the greatest value to the Center.  These are
listed in the table in section 2.1.

2.2   Application Software and License(s)
This service includes the application and/or any related software.  The anticipated user base is as follows:
    • Base year- min 1200 users  up to 2000 users
    • Option year 1- 1200 users up to 2000 users
    • Option year 2- 1200 users up to 2000 users

License(s) for the base year shall include maintenance, upgrades and support necessary to maintain and operate the product during that first
year.  In addition, any and all documentation necessary to operate and use the application shall be provided. Contractor shall provide the
ability of adding users up to the maximum quantity on a prorated basis throughout the year or option year.  Government will consider an
unlimited user version (e.g. enterprise license) if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.

2.3   Maintenance, Support & Upgrades
CDRH requires the vendor/contractor to provide the following for all option years under the scope of this contract.  As noted in section 2.2,
this shall be included with the license cost for the base year.
    • Maintenance – access and right to install any and all maintenance releases
    • Upgrades – access and right to install any and all application upgrades or enhancements
    • Support - Maintenance and Help Desk/technical support shall provide standard support services to ensure the software is functioning as
      expected and include phone access to technical expertise.  Minimal required services shall include telephone or email support for
      application failure/system down between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. eastern time.  These services should be described in a service
      level agreement to be included as part of the proposal.


2.4         Consulting Services

CDRH desires to use the software application “out of the box” to the extent possible.  However, as with any software application, some training
or assistance in optimizing the installation, configuring the system and/or applying application best practices may be required or appropriate.
Therefore, an IDIQ line item for 160 hours for consulting support should be included in your quote.
