                       Please include the following suggestion, comment or consideration to the document identified above.


The ability to enter ESA Dose, ESA Unit of Measure, ESA Route, Frequency of ESA Dose and Iron Dose, Iron Route, Frequency of Iron Dose.  Tom
Dudley requested this CR.

The ability to enter Serum iPTH lab result and Serum iPTH Collection Date must be supported in CROWNWeb as part of a complete clinical
perspective of Mineral Metabolism.

To ensure continuity of the “12 Elements” requirements, CR #257 and CR #258 have been combined into one change request for clarity and
consistency.


                                                              Why is this important?


This is important as part of a complete clinical perspective for Anemia Management and Mineral Metabolism.


                                                                Suggested Changes


Modification:

Addition: Please see below in the “Example of Changes” area for specific requirements.

Deletion:

Change Request Activity: 7/25/2008 – In the CRB meeting on 7/24/2008 the group determined that to add clarity, the BR and KDD would be
reevaluated and the appropriate changes would be made by QIS.  This was completed on 7/25/2009 and will be presented at the 7/29/2008 CRB
meeting.
Please note that QIS completed a comparison of the attributes in the Clinical Search versus the Data Entry and has provided a list of the
attributes pursuant to the BR that are appropriate.  Please see Appendix 1.

Per the 7/29/2008 CRB, it was determined that clarification to the prescription date be defined in the definition tab of the KDD, revised BR 6.1
ID 263 to reflect entry of ESA instead of Intravenous (IV) Iron under the field level requirements area.

Request was made to have either the changes/updates be in bold text or some other ways to identify what specific items are change so as to be
able to easily identify when printed in black and white.  QIS have now italicized all changes instead of bolding it due to items currently
listed in the requirements that are indeed bolded for emphasis.

It should also be noted that for the Alpha 0.4 release, ‘Date IV Iron Prescription Changed’ and ‘Date ESA Prescription Changed’ will be
implemented as per requirement “Date must be between or equal to an existing Admit Date and corresponding Discharged Date (if present) for the
patient at the Facility entering patient’s lab data.”  However, these date field level requirement will changed during Release 2.0 to be that
users could enter pre-ESRD or admit date.

Once all minor changes as noted during 7/29/2008 CRB have been modified, CR #257 is considered to be approve.

Per the developer’s questions sent on 9/10/2006, QIS responses included modifying KDD 6.1 ID 251 “Darbepoetin Alpha” to “Darbepoetin Alfa”;
updating KDD 6.1 ID 263 and ID 266 field level requirements to note that these fields are mandatory if ANY related ESA/IV Iron Prescription
fields are populated; and inclusion of BR 6.1 ID 202 (Date ESA Prescription Changed) and BR 6.1 ID 210 (Date IV Iron Prescription Changed) to
this CR.

Per the 9/23/2008 CRB, it was determined that clarification to the ESA and IV Iron Prescription Stop Date fields should note that the value
cannot be prior to the ESA and IV Iron Prescription Start Date values.  It was also recommended that the common lab test date not pre-populate
ESA or IV Iron change dates fields.

Per comments from the developer sent on 9/29/08, QIS deleted “Oral (PO) Iron Prescription Start Date” from both BR 11.2.6.2.2 and BR 11.2.6.5.2.

SECTION B - SUPPLIES OR SERVICES/PRICES





B.1   Brief Description of Services




The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain development and maintenance services to support the Consolidated Renal Operations in a
Web-Enabled Network (CROWN) application group.  The Contractor shall perform all requirements in accordance with this Statement of Work, and
shall meet the objectives of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and timely implementation of statutory and regulatory
requirements.


B.2   Type of Contract




The Government contemplates award of a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract.




B.3   Withholding of Contract Payments




Notwithstanding any other payment provisions of this contract, failure of the Contractor to submit required reports when due or failure to
perform or deliver required work, supplies, or services, will result in the withholding of payments under this contract unless such failure
arises out of causes beyond the control, and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as defined by the clause entitled "Excusable
Delays" or "Default", as applicable. The Government shall promptly notify the Contractor of its intention to withhold payment of any invoice or
voucher submitted.


B.4   Estimated Cost-Plus-Award Fee (CPAF)




A.  Estimated Cost and Award Fee

The total amount of this CPAF contract is $( TO BE DETERMINED), which includes a total estimated cost of $(TO BE DETERMINED), a base fee of $(TO
BE DETERMINED), and a maximum award fee of $(TO BE DETERMINED).  The base fee, if any, together with reimbursement of allowable cost, shall
constitute complete compensation for the work performed under this contract, except to the extent that payment of award fee may be allowed as
provided in paragraph B. which follows.

B.  Performance Award Fee

1.  The performance award fee available to be earned by the Contractor ranges from $(TO BE DETERMINED) to $(TO BE DETERMINED), which is hereby
established as the maximum amount of such award fee that the Contractor may earn during the period of performance of this contract.
Determinations will be made in accordance with Section G.2.  The base period is only 6 months, with the first evaluation period beginning on (TO
BE DETERMINED).  The Government's determination of the award fee amount and the award fee determination methodology are unilateral decisions
made solely at the discretion of the Government.  The amount of any award fee which may be awarded is subject to the limitation of the
Government's obligation in the clauses of this contract entitled, `Limitation of Funds' or `Limitations of Cost,' whichever is applicable.

2.  The award fee shall be based in accordance with the attached Award Fee Plan found in Section G.2.  The amount of the award fee to be paid is
determined by the Government's judgmental evaluation of the contractor's performance in terms of the criteria stated in the contract. This
determination and the methodology for determining the award fee are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government.  The
evaluation criteria and the requirements they represent in the Award Fee Plan may be revised from time to time at the sole discretion of the
Contracting Officer; provided that the Contractor has been notified in writing of such revisions at least thirty (30) days in advance of the
beginning of the period for which the Contractor's performance will be evaluated using the revised criteria. The award fee pool is the total of
the available award fee dollars for each evaluation period for the life of the contract.

3. Since the available award fee during the evaluation period must be earned, the contractor begins each evaluation period with 0% of the
available award fee and works up to the evaluated fee for each evaluation period.  Contractors do not begin with 100% of the available award fee
and have deductions withdrawn to arrive at the evaluated fee for each evaluation period. In addition, contractors should not receive award fee
(above the base fee) for simply meeting contract requirements.  Earning of award fee should be in accordance with the award fee plan, and should
be directly commensurate with the level of performance under the contract. A contractor will not receive the maximum amount of award fee under a
contract without a demonstrated superior level of performance, as provided for in the award fee plan. Maximum contract fee is the sum of all
fees (not just the award fee) and incentives payable under the contract, including performance and subcontracting incentives.

C.  Base Fee

1. The base fee, which may be $0, is a fixed amount that the contractor will receive for satisfactory contract performance.  Base fee is not
earned and is, therefore, paid on a regular basis upon the contractor submitting their voucher or invoice.  The Contracting Officer may withhold
payment of the base fee until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's
interest.  This reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of the applicable base fee or $100,000, whichever is less.

2.  The Contracting Officer shall release 75 percent of all base fee withheld under this contract after receipt of the certified final indirect
cost rate proposal covering the year of physical completion of this contract, provided the Contractor has satisfied all other contract terms and
conditions, including the submission of the final patent and royalty reports, and is not delinquent in submitting final vouchers on prior years'
settlements. The Contracting Officer may release up to 90 percent of the base fee withheld under this contract based on the Contractor's past
performance related to the submission and settlement of final indirect cost rate proposals.




B.5   Fixed Fee Payment Schedule (If Applicable)




The contractor shall voucher for payment in accordance with the instructions provided in
Section G of this contract.  The Contractor shall include fee on a monthly basis based on the following fee schedule, which will be completed at
time of award:
 
      Month            Payment/Month               Total
      1-11             TBD*                  TBD*
      12               TBD*                  TBD*
      Withholding 15%                              TBD*
                       Total                 TBD*

*Note: To be determined at time of award.
SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS




C.1   Introduction


Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material
equipment and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform this Statement of Work.


C.1.1 Purpose Error! Bookmark not defined."


The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain development and maintenance services to support the Consolidated Renal Operations in a
Web-Enabled Network (CROWN) application group.  The Contractor shall perform all requirements in accordance with this Statement of Work, and
shall meet the objectives of increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and timely implementation of statutory and regulatory
requirements.



C.1.2 BackgroundError! Bookmark not defined."


Maintenance of information on the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) population by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is mandated by
legislation and regulation. (See Public Law 95-292, Section (c)(1)(A); 42 CFR, Chapter IV, Part 476; and Public Law 92-603, Section 299I).  In
support of the CMS ESRD community, CMS created the Program Management and Medical Information System (PMMIS).  The PMMIS is the system of
records for the CMS ESRD data, and is maintained by means of the CROWN suite of systems.  CROWN refers to any and all components of the suite of
ESRD systems – the Renal Management Information System (REMIS), the Standard Information Management System (SIMS), CROWNWeb, Cognos Reporting
Tool, QualityNet Identity Provisioning System (QIPS), and all related databases and architecture.

CMS authorized the design and implementation of CROWNWeb in support of the new ESRD Conditions for Coverage which were published in 2008.
Release 1.0 of CROWNWeb was placed in production on February 1st, 2009, one of the most important aspects of this SOW is to continue the
development of CROWNWeb in order to better support the needs of the ESRD Networks, ESRD dialysis and transplant facilities, CMS, and other CMS
partners.

Continued operational and maintenance support of REMIS is an important aspect of this SOW.  REMIS has been in production since 2000 and has been
in a mostly steady state (i.e. no releases) for the last two years.  However, because of its importance in the supply of data for accurate
entitlement and payment decisions, it is crucial that system operations are smoothly continued.



C.1.3 Error! Bookmark not defined."Assumptions and Constraints


   1. “CROWN” refers to any and all components of the Division of ESRD Systems and Contract Management  (DESCM) system suite - REMIS, CROWNWeb,
      SIMS, Cognos Reporting Tool, QIPS, and all related databases and architecture.


   2. The Prime Contractor must provide written proof of a CMMI Level II Certification (SCAMPI Report) or higher.

   3. CMS will utilize several contracts to develop and support the CROWN application group.  The CROWN development and maintenance Contractor is
      not eligible to hold any contract for the Infrastructure, Independent Verification & Validation (IV&V), or Business Requirements Definition
       tasks associated with the CROWN application group.  The CROWN Contractor shall not use subcontractors currently working on CROWN
      Infrastructure, IV&V, or Business Requirements Definition tasks.

   4. The Contractor shall perform all system development and maintenance using the languages and tools currently in use, unless the Project

   5. SIMS system maintenance is not part of this contract except where specifically noted in this (SOW) and where it is considered part of the
      entire CROWN system; however, maintenance of the SIMS database is considered within the scope of this SOW.

   6. General ESRD Network support is not a part of this contract except where specifically noted in this Statement of Work (SOW).

   7. CMS anticipates one major scheduled release per year that contains the bulk of software changes needed for CROWNWeb.  REMIS will have no
      scheduled releases at this time.  In addition, emergency releases (for CROWNWeb and REMIS) will occur as required to accommodate situations
      when it is not feasible to wait until a major release to perform needed fixes.


   8. Contractor personnel who are required to obtain a CMS badge shall undergo a background investigation.  See Section G. 11, Security Clause –
      Background Investigations for Contractor Personnel for New Contracts


   9. The Contractor’s key personnel shall be available to travel to CMS Central Office several times each week for meetings.


  10. All software, licenses, and equipment purchased with government funds under this contract become the property of CMS, and must be

      billable to this contract (for example, Oracle and JAVA).

  15. The Contractor shall provide training to CMS staff on Contractor unique software and tools, when requested by CMS..  This training is
      billable to this contract.


  16. The Contractor shall establish connectivity to the CMS designated Data Centers in order to perform required tasks.

  17. The Contractor shall assist CMS staff, ESRD Networks, researchers (e.g. USRDS, KECC), other Contractors, and other entities, as requested,
      in support of the CMS ESRD program.

  18. The Contractor shall provide all deliverables in the format prescribed by CMS.  Unless otherwise specified by CMS, the contract shall use
      the current CMS/QualityNet standard desktop suite.

C.2   General Requirements for All Application Design, Development, Maintenance, and Operations


All software and documentation created under this contract shall become the property of CMS.

The requirements under this section apply to all application design, development, maintenance, and integration activities in this statement of
work.


C.2.1 Gathering and Finalizing Requirements


For the purposes of this SOW, requirements are categorized into two groups; business requirements and system requirements.  Business
requirements are defined as any requirement that is initiated by a business component of the ESRD program (e.g. QIG, QMHAG, Networks, facilities
or any organization outside of ISG & OIS) and any requirement that would fundamentally be considered “business” (e.g. the collection of clinical
data elements, the specifications for a patient report) as opposed to “IT”.  System requirements are defined as any requirement that is “IT” in
nature or that is initiated within ISG or from OIS (e.g. must be 3-tier environment, must follow all CMS security standards, file formats).
Requirements related to the usability of the system (dropdown vs. textbox, data refresh within 10 minutes) are considered business requirements
if they are initiated by a business component, or system requirements if they are initiated by ISG or OIS, and will not be a requirement but
considered a design element if initiated by the developer.

The Contractor is responsible for all activities in this section related to system requirements; however, unless specifically stated otherwise,
all activities in this section related to business requirements shall only be performed in support of the REMIS, QIPS, and data access of the
CROWN suite.  The business requirements Contractor is responsible for these activities for CROWNWeb, including Batch/Electronic Data Interchange
(requirements related to the technical aspects of batch such as file schemas and security measures are system requirements not business
requirements), and reporting.

The Contractor shall perform change management activities, including the receipt and control of change requests and problem reports. The
Contractor shall use a CMS-designated requirements tracking system.

Software requirements, enhancements, changes, and bug fixes may be identified by End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Networks, ESRD
Providers/facilities, TPSs, Contractor staff, researchers, Medicare Secondary Payers (MSPs), or CMS.  Identification may be the result of
meetings, help desk tickets, JAD sessions, or Contractor established user groups, etc.

The Contractor is responsible for tracking proposed enhancements, changes, and bug fixes as Change Requests.  The Contractor shall organize
Change Requests according to system (e.g., QIPS and REMIS) and type (e.g., bug fixes, enhancements) and forward to the CMS for approval and
prioritization.

Scheduling of Change Requests into a release is based on the level of effort allowed for each release; which in turn is based on other CMS

C.3.6 Task 6 – Electronic/Batch Collection of Administrative and Clinical Data




All CROWNWeb development must follow the general requirements outlined in Section C.2, General Requirements for all Application Design,
Development, Maintenance, and Operations of this statement of work.

Electronic/Batch Data Collection [through Third-Party Submitters, hereafter referred to as “TPSs”] refers to submission of data from CMS-
certified dialysis facilities to CMS. For initial production pilot implementation, three TPSs have been approved by CMS. After production
implementation, CMS expects additional potential TPSs to apply for approval.

The three TPSs approved by CMS for initial production implementation are DaVita Corporation, Dialysis Clinics Incorporated, and Fresenius
Medical Care-North America Incorporated. These organizations participated with CMS in the development and testing of CROWNWeb third-party
submission. They were selected based on the number of patients treated in their facilities; their history of data submission to CMS; and their
willingness to change their data systems and devote workpower to the development and testing process.  Until CMS’s final decision on the
feasibility of batch, their batch data submission for CROWNWeb production is considered a “pilot” test.

The submitted data consists of administrative and clinical information about dialysis patients. The Contractor is also responsible for the
establishment and maintenance of specific facility-level information in the CROWNWeb application to enable batch submission by approved TPSs.

The CROWNWeb application accommodates batch submission at any time, but currently we are using a submission schedule. Batch submitters install
CMS-approved software and make use of a Virtual Private Network to transmit the data to CMS systems.


C.3.6.1     Task 6a – Enhancement of EDI/Batch Collection Activities


The Contractor shall maintain and if necessary enhance the functionality needed for the electronic collection of administrative and clinical
data. This work includes but is not limited to the following major areas of functionality within the CROWNWeb batch portion of the system: (1)
submittal; (2) processing; (3) batch feedback report for each submission showing errors, warning, and items successfully processed; and (4)
audit update report.  Refer to 12/22/2008 versions of these documents for a comprehensive description of first-release functionality:
      • BR9-EDI_REQUIREMENTS_V1_4.xls
      • KDD_BR9_CROWNWEB_Patient_Data_EDI (Table 1).xls
      • KDD_BR9_CROWNWEB_Clinical_Data_EDI (Table 2).xls

Batch processing includes checking the format of the submission to ensure that it meets CMS’s submittal specification; checking the contents of
the submission against requirements of the data dictionary and business requirements; and updating the application database if appropriate.

The CROWNWeb application that allows a user to select a file for upload, initiates the upload process, and after processing downloads a batch
feedback report.

The audit update report provides a row-level listing of every change to patient data resulting from batch processing.

For any CROWNWeb release scheduled during this contract's period of performance, the Contractor shall perform the following activities:
      • Design, code, test and implement all changes or additions, approved by CMS, to batch processing included in the business and system
        requirements documentation for the release.
      • Create or modify batch schemas as required by application functionality. The Release 1.0 batch patient schema and batch clinical schema
        are attached.
      •  Accept, process, evaluate and report on test file submissions from all approved TPSs. (Activities relating to the expansion of batch to
        other TPSs are shown below.)
      • Assess changes and report to CMS on actions necessary to ensure that batch functionality matches manual data-entry (standard user
        interface) functionality. The Contractor shall ensure that all maintenance activities affecting any part of the application, especially
        the “standard user interface,” are evaluated to determine if corresponding changes to the Third-Party Submission are necessary. Unless
        specifically directed to the contrary by CMS, the Contractor shall maintain functional equivalence between the standard user interface
        and the batch process. All standard user interface documentation changes, software changes, table changes and business procedure changes
        shall be evaluated by the Contractor. The Contractor shall propose changes in the batch process to maintain functional equivalence. The
        Contractor shall ensure that maintenance timelines include TPS interface deliverables on the same schedule as standard user interface
        deliverables unless specifically directed to the contrary in writing by the Project Officer.
      • Facilitate and support various test efforts. (Test efforts requiring facilitation and/or support may include, but are not limited to:
        stress testing, independent verification and validation testing, alpha testing, beta testing, ESRD Network liaison testing, and
        requirements acceptance testing). This includes configuration of test environments. All new or modified functionality is to be tested.
        The types of testing needed will be determined by CMS.
      • Participate in Change Control Process. This could entail attendance and note-taking at weekly or more-frequent meetings with CMS to take
        or support the following actions on suggested changes:
              o Record
              o Analyze
              o Determine if specification is adequate
              o Estimate benefit if implemented
              o Estimate cost to implement
              o Prioritize




C.3.6.2     Task 6b – Maintenance of EDI/Batch Collection Activities


The Contractor shall develop or maintain software and business processes to load TPS data into the application and provide a weekly “Batch
Submission Report” showing at a minimum the number of items submitted, the number accepted, and the number rejected, with breakdowns by
submitter, date of submission, type of item, reason for rejection, and ESRD Network Organization with jurisdiction over the facility involved.


The Contractor shall provide a weekly “Third-Party Submission Authorization Report” showing which dialysis units have authorized Third-Party
Submission, the effective date of such authorization, the revocation date if applicable, and the current status of internal application controls
for each unit (“batch submission enabled” or “batch submission not enabled”).

The Contractor shall make any necessary changes to software and business processes to meet CMS security and technical requirements.




C.3.6.3     Task 6c – Operational Support of EDI/Batch Collection


To support CMS’s Third-Party Submission process, the Contractor shall:
  • Identify trends in batch useful for finding “problems” or assisting ESRD Networks and submitting organizations with data analysis. The trends
    identified will be reported in a weekly, as needed, “Data Analysis Trend Report.” For example, such a report could include a summary of
    errors or conditions preventing patient or clinical records from being added to CROWNWeb broken down by submitting organization, by schema
    type, by Network or by other significant characteristics.
  • Provide technical advice and other support to in-production TPSs (those submitters for whom batch submission is accepted in production), up
    to a maximum of eight work-hours per submitter per month.
  • Provide Batch Operations monthly reports on batch process including (but not limited to):
         o Areas of concern about the effectiveness, timeliness and accuracy of batch processing; about the workpower required to support the
           batch process; or on any other topic that reasonably bears on an evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of CROWNWeb batch
           processing
         o Metrics showing records submitted, records accepted and records rejected by organization
         o Recommendations to improve batch process if applicable
         o Recommendations on changes to maintain functional equivalence between the standard user interface and the batch process.
         o Assessment of success in resolving discrepancies arising in batch by submitting organization.  Refer to CROWNWeb Batch Discrepancy
           Resolution Document for additional information.
  • As directed by CMS, participate in coordination of data inquiry and cleanup activities.
  • As directed by CMS, participate in execution of data inquiry and cleanup activities.



C.3.6.4     Task 6d – EDI/Batch Expansion Activities


The Contractor shall support CMS’s expansion of CROWNWeb batch submission to include additional Third-Party submitters. (Batch processing allows
dialysis facilities or organizations to shift some work to automated systems. However, the facilities remain responsible for the timeliness and
accuracy of the data required by CMS, and the facilities and their submitters must make corrections to submitted data as necessary to meet CMS
standards.)

There are over 5100 active dialysis facilities separately identified in CMS records. Of those, approximately 3200 are included in the pilot test
involving DCI, DaVita and Fresenius. CMS expects at least 60% of the remaining facilities to attempt to qualify (through Third-Party Submitters)
to submit data in batch. Experience with the development of batch processing for CROWNWeb indicates that a wide range of expertise will be found
among potential batch submitters. It seems likely that some potential TPSs may never be able to quality technically, although almost all
dialysis facilities have some experience with automated data collection and processing.

The Contractor shall propose a batch expansion plan. (There is no dependency relationship between batch expansion and future CROWNWeb releases.)


The plan should include a section on surveying the dialysis facility community to determine the extent of interest in, and technical readiness
for, batch submission. The Contractor shall draft for CMS approval a survey instrument or other data-gathering communication to be sent to all
open, active CMS-certified dialysis facilities. After approval, the Contractor shall send the survey or communication to all dialysis facilities
except those already participating in batch submission. The Contractor shall receive and analyze replies. Where an open, active dialysis
facility not already submitting data in batch fails to reply, the Contractor shall make use of CMS ESRD Provider Registry information to make
three follow-up attempts in a two-month period (two by phone and one by mail or e-mail). The Contractor shall prepare a report for CMS
summarizing the results of the community survey in such a way that CMS can reliably understand how many dialysis facilities have expressed
interest in batch submission; how many patients they cared for at the time of survey; their apparent technical readiness; the time frames in
which they could devote resources establishing routine CROWNWeb batch submission; and their intentions at the time of the survey in terms of
cooperating with other dialysis facilities, dialysis provider organizations, or vendor to participate in CROWNWeb batch submission.

The plan should reflect the evaluation of different approaches to maximizing participation in batch submission – for example, applicants might
be grouped into “classes,” with each class sending in documentation with the same due date; or applicants might be accepted on a flow basis but
grouped into “stages,” so that the key information about each applicant is milestone-related: application received; facilities list received;
etc.

The Contractor shall provide a weekly “Third-Party Submission Candidate Status Report” showing all organizations whose Third-Party Submission
applications have been received by the Contractor by organization (rows), by milestone (columns [application received, facility mapping
information received]), by date (in the cells). CMS may choose to provide additional specifications for this report.

To manage and support the expansion of batch to additional TPSs, the Contractor shall:
    • Inform the ESRD community (with focus on dialysis providers) of application process for batch submission
    • Provide a recommendation to CMS that explicitly identifies the organizations ranked by size (number of facilities) for purposes of
      expanding batch to the maximum number of facilities. (Once approved, this list will represent CMS’s prioritization of potential submitting
      organizations.)
    • Prepare an electronic information packet describing the application process and the standards to be met by new applicants. This information
      packet may be made available on the Internet, or provided electronically to potential TPSs. The packet shall include (but not be limited
      to):
         o One-page overview diagram for entire process an organization would need to become a batch submitter
         o Security/technical requirements for batch
         o Application form for batch submission with list of facilities (and approximate number of patients per facility), statement of
           responsibilities and signature for agreement of candidate submitter. The statement of responsibilities includes:
               ▪ Timely submission of data
               ▪ Accuracy/completeness of data
               ▪ Resolution of errors and warnings identified in batch feedback files
               ▪ Development of internal processes to communicate with member facilities
               ▪ Required support for member facilities (i.e., when a batch discrepancy can be resolved by the facility or its batch submitting
                 organization, those entities accept responsibility for that resolution)
         o Patient XML schema
         o Facility XML schema
         o Sample feedback file
    • Accept, process, evaluate and report on test file submissions from all CMS-approved candidate batch submitters.


    • Determine if applicant TPSs are technically capable of submitting acceptable data on behalf of facilities. The Contractor shall request
      such test data submissions as it deems suitable, and shall provide feedback on those submissions, as long as no more than three test
      submissions per file type (per candidate submitting organization) are required to evaluate the test submissions, provide feedback, and make
      a determination of technical capability.
    • Evaluate TPS applicants and make approval/disapproval recommendations to CMS.
    • Notify the candidate organization of the final disposition (Approved or Denied) by letter and/or electronic message within 60 days of the
      date of application.
    • Develop recommendations to CMS for improvements to the submitter evaluation/approval process and the overall TPS effort.
    • Make any necessary changes in internal system data (system tables) to accept data from properly approved and facility-authorized TPSs, and
      to stop accepting data for a particular facility if the authorization from that facility is revoked.
    • Take such steps as are needed to update CROWNWeb with facility-specific information necessary for batch processing, including but not
      limited to:
         o Accepting a list of facilities from qualified TPS candidates.
         o Accepting and processing a facility file from each qualified TPS candidate.
         o Confirming that a proper Form CMS-10268 is on file for each facility listed.
         o Verifying facility mapping from Form CMS-10268 to the CROWNWeb facility registry.
         o Coordinating resolution of facility-mapping discrepancies with candidate TPSs.
    • Take such steps as are needed to update CROWNWeb with patient-specific information necessary for batch processing, potentially including
      but not limited to:
         o Accepting and processing a patient file from each qualified TPS candidate.
         o Verifying patient mapping from patient file to the CROWNWeb patient registry.
         o Performing a test load of patient data into a copy of the CROWNWeb production database.
         o Supporting resolution of near-match cases by ESRD Networks and TPSs by producing listings showing near-match identifiers and reasons

         o Updating CROWNWeb database with patient mapping information.


C.3.7 Task 7 – CROWN Data Access and Reporting


All development must follow the general requirements outlined in Section C.2, General Requirements for all Application Design, Development,
Maintenance, and Operations of this statement of work.

The purpose of this task is to provide the ESRD Networks and CMS with a mechanism for direct access to  CROWN data.  CROWN data comes from
several data sources including REMIS, the SIMS Central Repository, and CROWNWeb.  This direct access needs to be technologically presented in a
format such that the ESRD Networks are able to extract any CROWN data that is needed to fulfill the contractual requirements of their ESRD
Network Base Contract.  This data may also be utilized by CMS personnel.


Under this task, the Contractor shall perform all work necessary to provide end-user access to CROWN data to both ESRD Network and CMS
personnel.  Specific activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:

    • Confer with CMS and ESRD Networks on potential designs and data views.
    • Presentation and approval by CMS of proposed technological solutions during design phase.
    • Design of data access processes and structures.
    • Authoring of a Requirements and Conceptual Design Document (RAC-D) and participation in the review and approval process of this document.
    • Participation in ERB process for QualityNet approval.
    • Provide technical assistance for the purchase of all necessary hardware and software.
    • Configuration of all hardware and software structures.
    • Design and development of nightly replication processes.
    • Requirements gathering for the design of views.
    • Design and development of views.
    • System and unit testing.
    • Performance testing and tuning.
    • Participation in IV&V and ITF testing.
    • Production of a data dictionary and Entity Relationship (ER) diagram to support ESRD Network and CMS report creators.
    • Creation of user training WebEx(s).
    • Creation of a comprehensive user guide.
    • Maintenance of configuration, data structures, replication processes, ERBs, data dictionary, ER diagram, user guide, etc.

Detailed requirements for the design of this data access solution will be developed as part of the RAC-D and ERB process; however, the end
solution must meet the following general requirements:

    • Approved by CMS OIS Technical Review Board
    • Access shall be made available in a secure Three-Tier architecture (i.e Cognos).
    • Data shall be accessible by ESRD Network and CMS personnel.
    • Replicated copies of CROWN data tables (REMIS, SIMS Central Repository, CROWNWeb) will be made available for end-user access.
    • The base data for CROWN Data Access (i.e. tables) shall be available in their original CROWN structure (no reformatting on replication
      unless approved in advance by CMS).
    • In addition to copies of the original tables, predefined data views will be made available.
    • Base data will be replicated/refreshed nightly.
    • ESRD Network and CMS users shall have appropriate scope/access to data as directed by CMS.
    • Access for all users is read-only.
    • Users will be able to download and manipulate data on their QualityNet workstations.


C.3.7 1     Task 7a – Development of Views for CROWN Data Access




The Contractor shall work with CMS and the Networks in order to identify key views of CROWN data that will support ESRD Network business
functions and will simplify efforts pertaining to Network data access.  The purpose of these views is to consolidate like data in order to
minimize table joins; for example, all patient information would be pulled together from several tables in a logical view, so that a user can
create and modify queries and reports without having to know the many details of how the primary database is structured.


The following are a few examples of possible views that should be considered:


   1. Current personnel/facility with both the facility address and the person's address (two separate addresses - maybe facility carrying to
      personal if there isn't a separate one) - there would be a row for each personnel record.  Supports personnel mailing labels.
   2. Current patient/facility/treatment/patient residence address - all in one row - to support the majority of needed roster, etc type
      reporting. 
   3. Current facility (without personnel) - for most facility reporting - one row per facility.
   4. Patient/facility/treatment/patient residence address as of 12/31/2007 – daily pre-calculated snapshot based on event data that shows where
      that person was on a year-end date.  Could continue to be re-created as the data is updated - this would support some of the 2744
      functionality.
   5. Accretions and Notifications data from SIMS.

C.6   Memorandum of Understanding for CROWN Application Production Support




NWITS/CROWN Teams

Rev. 12/9/2008 1 MOU - CROWN Service Level Agreement.doc MOU

General overview
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) describes the responsibilities of each internal support group in relation with other support groups,
including the process and timeframe for delivery of their services. The objective of the MOU is to present a clear, concise and measurable
description of the service provided by each of the support groups involved in an activity. The MOU will ensure that the underpinning activities
that are performed are clearly aligned to provide the intended Target Service Levels (TSL).

Target Service Level (TSLs) should be developed with the users’ business needs in mind.  Users perceive the total service and evaluate it based
on how well it meets their needs.  TSLs document and manage service and support expectations, using metrics to monitor the TSLs ensures the
service provided meets CMS support goals. TSLs record the common understanding about services, priorities, responsibilities, guarantee, and such
— collectively, the level of service. For example, it may specify the levels of availability, serviceability, performance, operation, or other
attributes of the service.

This MOU documents the information technology (IT) support services provided by the CROWN Production Support Group for support of the CROWN
Helpdesk to investigate, analyze, and resolve defects or other activities unable to be completed through the CROWN UI. The ultimate objective of
this Agreement is to document internal IT support-group services and processes to ensure high-quality and timely delivery of IT services to
customers in the ESRD community based on CMS expectations. This MOU directly addresses the IT structure required to support CMS, Network,
Facility, and LDO organizations related to NWITS and QIS Contractors.

IV. Award Fee Criteria and Award Fee Pool Distribution

Award Fee Criteria:  Performance based Award Fee determinations are fundamentally a response to Contractor “output” that exceeds CMS contract
requirements with respect to timeliness.

G. 3  AWARD FEE PLAN SCHEDULE




(a) An Award Fee Plan shall be unilaterally established by the Government based on the criteria stated in the contract and used for the
determination of award fee. This plan shall include the criteria used to evaluate each area and the percentage of award fee (if any) available
for each area. A copy of the plan shall be provided to the contractor ____30____ calendar days prior to the start of the first evaluation
period.

(b) The criteria contained within the Award Fee Plan may relate to Program Management and Business Requirement Deliverables due dates.

(c) The Award Fee Plan may, consistent with the contract, be revised unilaterally by the Government at any time during the period of
performance. Notification of such changes shall be provided to the contractor____15_____ calendar days prior to the start of the evaluation
period to which the change will apply.


G. 4  FINAL INDIRECT COST RATE PROPOSAL




Pursuant to the provisions of FAR 52.216-7 entitled "Allowable Cost & Payment" in Section I of this contract, final annual indirect cost rates
and the appropriate bases shall be established in accordance with Subpart 42.7 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect for the
period covered by the indirect cost rate proposal.

The Contractor shall submit an adequate final indirect cost rate proposal to the Contracting Officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) and
cognizant Government auditor within the 6-month period following the expiration of each of its fiscal years. Reasonable extensions, for
exceptional circumstances only, may be requested in writing by the Contractor and granted in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor
shall support its proposal with adequate supporting data.

The proposed rates shall be based on the Contractor's actual cost experience for that period. The appropriate Government representative and the
Contractor shall establish the final indirect cost rates as promptly as practical after receipt of the Contractor's proposal.


The Contractor and the appropriate Government representative shall execute a written understanding setting forth the final indirect cost rates.
The understanding shall specify (i) the agreed-upon final annual indirect cost rates, (ii) the bases to which the rates apply, (iii) the periods
for which the rates apply, (iv) any specific indirect cost items treated as direct costs in the settlement, and (v) the affected contract and/or
subcontract, identifying any with advance agreements or special terms and the applicable rates. The understanding shall not change any monetary
ceiling, contract obligation, or specific cost allowance or disallowance provided for in this contract. The understanding is incorporated into
this contract upon execution. Failure by the parties to agree on a final annual indirect cost rate shall be a dispute within the meaning of the
Disputes clause.

Within 120 days (or longer period if approved in writing by the Contracting Officer) after settlement of the final annual indirect cost rates
for all years of a physically complete contract, the Contractor shall submit a completion invoice or voucher to reflect the settled amounts and
rates.

If the Contractor fails to submit a completion invoice or voucher within the time specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this clause (FAR 52.216-7),
the Contracting Officer may:

     (A) Determine the amounts due to the Contractor under the contract; and
     (B) Record this determination in a unilateral modification to the contract.

This determination constitutes the final decision of the Contracting Officer in accordance with the Disputes clause.

The final indirect rate proposal that is to be submitted to the Contracting Officer shall be submitted to the following address:

       Department of Health and Human Services
       Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
       Division of Medicare Support Contracts

G. 5  PROVISIONAL INDIRECT COST RATES




Until final annual indirect cost rates are established for any period, the Government shall reimburse the Contractor at billing rates
established by the Contracting Officer or by an authorized representative (e.g., the cognizant Government auditor), subject to adjustment when
the final rates are established. These billing rates:

     (1) Shall be the anticipated final rates; and

     (2) May be prospectively or retroactively revised by mutual agreement, at either party's request, to
     prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment.

1.  Performance of the work under this contract shall be subject to the technical monitoring of the Project Officer. The term "Technical
Monitoring" is defined to include, without limitation, the following:

     a. Technical directions to the Contractor which redirect the contract effort, shift work emphasis between
     work areas or tasks, require pursuit of certain lines of inquiry, fill in details or otherwise serve to
     accomplish contractual statement of work.

     b. Providing information to the Contractor for assistance in the interpretation of drawings, specifications
     or technical portions of the work description.

     c. Review and, where required by the contract, approval of technical reports, drawings, specifications
     and technical information to be delivered by the Contractor to the Government under the contract.

2.  Technical direction must be within the general statement of work stated in the contract. The Project Officer does not have the authority to
and may not issue any technical direction which:

     a. constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the general scope of the contract;

     b. constitutes a change as defined in the contract clause entitled "Changes";

     c. in any manner causes an increase or decrease in the total estimated contract cost, the fixed fee or the
     time required for contract performance; or

receiving such notification from the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall issue an appropriate contract modification or advise the
Contractor in writing that, in his opinion, the technical direction is within the scope of this article and does not constitute a change under
the Changes Clause of the contract. The Contractor shall thereupon proceed immediately with the direction given. A failure of the parties to
agree upon the nature of the instruction or direction or upon the contract action to be taken with respect thereto shall be subject to the
provisions of the contract clause entitled "Disputes."


G. 8  GOVERNMENT POINTS OF CONTACT




(a) The (TO BE DETERMINED) for this contract is (TO BE DETERMINED).

(b) The (TO BE DETERMINED) will provide technical direction and discussion, as relating to, but not limited to the specification and/or
statement of work, and will monitor the progress and quality of the contractor's performance.

would change the pricing, quantity, quality, place of performance, delivery schedule, or any other terms and conditions of the contract, or to
direct the accomplishment of effort which goes beyond the scope of the statement of work in the contract.  When, in the opinion of the
contractor, the (TO BE DETERMINED) requests any of the aforementioned changes, the contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in
writing.  If the contractor believes or interprets any action by the (TO BE DETERMINED) to be a change to the contract, the contractor shall
promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing.  No action shall be taken by the contractor under such direction until the Contracting
Officer has issued a modification to the contract concerning the subject change(s) or has otherwise resolved the issue.  In the event the
contractor effects any change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made
without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in charges incurred as a result thereof.


G. 9  DESIGNATION OF PROJECT OFFICER

(c)  In the event your organization receives guidance from other than the Contracting Officer and such guidance is considered beyond or outside
the scope of the contract, then the Contracting Officer must be contacted in writing immediately for the authority to proceed.  Any guidance
relative to this contract which is determined by the Contracting Officer to be beyond or outside the scope of this contract as written shall not
be binding on the Government unless and until ratified in writing by a modification to this contract by the Contracting Officer.

(d)  Unless and until the Contracting Officer determines the guidance is within the scope of this contract and modifies same, vouchers may not
be submitted for work already performed.


G. 10 PROJECT DIRECTOR

G. 12 SECURITY CLAUSE - BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS FOR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL FOR NEW CONTRACTS




If applicable, Contractor personnel performing services for CMS under this contract, shall be required to undergo a background investigation.
CMS will pay for the background investigations.

After contract award, the CMS Project Officer (PO) and the Emergency Management & Response Group (EMRG), with the assistance of the Contractor,
shall perform a position-sensitivity analysis based on the duties contractor personnel shall perform on the contract.  The results of the
position-sensitivity analysis will determine first, whether the provisions of this clause are applicable to the contract and second, if
applicable, determine each position's sensitivity level (i.e., high risk, moderate risk or low risk) and dictate the appropriate level of
background investigation to be processed.  Investigative packages may contain the following forms:

      1. SF-85,  Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, 09/1995

      2. SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, 09/1995

      3. OF-612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, 12/2002

      4. OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, 01/2001

      5. Credit Report Release Form

      6. FD-258, Fingerprint Card, 5/99, and

      7. CMS-730A, Request for Physical Access to CMS Facilities (NON-CMS ONLY), 11/2003.

The Contractor personnel shall be required to undergo a background investigation commensurate with one of these position-sensitivity levels:

     (1)  High Risk (Level 6)

     Public Trust positions that would have a potential for exceptionally serious impact on the integrity and
     efficiency of the service. This would include computer security of a major automated information
     system (AIS).  This includes positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish
     public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned government activities,
     whether or not actual damage occurs, particularly if duties are especially critical to the agency or
     program mission with a broad scope of responsibility and authority.

Major responsibilities that would require this level include:

     a. development and administration of CMS computer security programs, including direction and control
     of risk analysis and/or threat assessment;

     b. significant involvement in mission-critical systems;

     c. preparation or approval of data for input into a system which does not necessarily involve personal
     access to the system but with relatively high risk of causing grave damage or realizing significant
     personal gain;

      d. other responsibilities that involve relatively high risk of causing damage or realizing personal gain;

      e. policy implementation;

      f. higher level management duties/assignments or major program responsibility; or

      g. independent spokespersons or non-management position with authority for independent action.

Approximate cost of each investigation:  $3,500

     2)  Moderate Risk (Level 5)

     Public Trust positions that have potential for moderate to serious impact on the integrity and efficiency
     of the service, including computer security.  These positions involve duties of considerable importance
     to the CMS mission with significant program responsibilities that could cause damage to large portions
     of AIS.  Duties involved are considerably important to the agency or program mission with significant
     program responsibility, or delivery of service.   Responsibilities that would require this level include:

          a. the direction, planning, design, operation, or maintenance of a computer system and whose work is
          technically reviewed by a higher authority at the High Risk level to ensure the integrity of the
          system;

          b. systems design, operation, testing, maintenance, and/or monitoring that are carried out under the
          technical review of a higher authority at the High Risk level;

          c. access to and/or processing of information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974;

          d. assists in policy development and implementation;

          e. mid-level management duties/assignments;

          f. any position with responsibility for independent or semi-independent action; or

          g. delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust.

Approximate cost range of each investigation:  $150 - $2,600

     3)  Low Risk (Level 1)

     Positions having the potential for limited interaction with the agency or program mission, so the
     potential for impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service is small.  This includes computer
     security impact on AIS.

Approximate cost of each investigation: $100

     The Contractor shall submit the investigative package(s) to the EMRG within three (3) days after being
     advised by the EMRG of the need to submit packages.  Investigative packages shall be submitted to the
     following address:


      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
               Office of Operations Management
               Emergency Management & Response Group
               Mail Stop SL-13-15
               7500 Security Boulevard
               Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850

The Contractor shall submit a copy of the transmittal letter to the Contracting Officer (CO).

Contractor personnel shall submit a CMS-730A (Request for Badge) to the EMRG (see attachment in Section J).  The Contractor and the PO shall
obtain all necessary signatures on the CMS-730A prior to any Contractor employee arriving for fingerprinting and badge processing.

The Contractor must appoint a Security Investigation Liaison as a point of contact to resolve any issues of inaccurate or incomplete form(s).
Where personal information is involved, EMRG may need to contact the contractor employee directly.  The Security Investigation Liaison may be
required to facilitate such contact.

After EMRG fingerprints contractor personnel and issues them a temporary CMS identification badge, the EMRG will send their completed
investigative package to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  OPM will conduct the background investigation.  Badges will be provided by
EMRG while contractor personnel investigative forms are being processed.  The Contractor remains fully responsible for ensuring contract
performance pending completion of background investigations of contractor personnel.

EMRG shall provide written notification to the CO with a copy to the PO of all suitability decisions.  The PO shall then notify the Contractor
in writing of the approval of the Contractor's employee(s), at that time the Contractor's employee(s) will receive a permanent identification
badge.  Contractor personnel who the EMRG determines to be ineligible may be required to cease working on the contract immediately.

The Contractor shall report immediately in writing to EMRG with copies to the CO and the PO, any adverse information regarding any of its
employees that may impact their ability to perform under this contract.  Reports should be based on reliable and substantiated information, not
on rumor or innuendo.  The report shall include the contractor employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information
being reported.

Contractor personnel shall be provided an opportunity to explain or refute unfavorable information found in an investigation to EMRG before an
adverse adjudication is made.   Contractor personnel may request, in writing, a copy of their own investigative results by contacting:

    reimbursement contracts for services):

         (i) Name and address of the contractor.

         (ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (Contractors should date invoices as close as possible to the date

          Government bills of lading.

          (vi) Name and address of contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that
          in  the contract or in a proper notice of assignment).

          (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of the person to notify in

          (ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.

          (x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (e.g., evidence of shipment).

    (2) An interim payment request under a cost-reimbursement contract for services constitutes a proper
    invoice for purposes of this subsection if it includes all of the information required by the contract.

    (3) If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, CMS's billing office must return it within 7
    days after receipt with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. If such notice is not timely, then CMS's
    billing office must adjust the due date for the purpose of determining an interest penalty, if any.

d.   Payment authorization.

All invoice payments, with the exception of interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services, must be supported by a receiving
report or other Government documentation authorizing payment (e.g., Government certified voucher). The agency receiving official should forward
the receiving report or other Government documentation to the designated payment office by the 5th working day after Government acceptance or
approval, unless other arrangements have been made. This period of time does not extend the due dates prescribed in this section. Acceptance
should be completed as expeditiously as possible. The receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment must, at a minimum,
include the following:

      (1) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed.

      (2) Description of supplies delivered or services performed.

      (3) Quantities of supplies received and accepted or services performed, if applicable.

      (4) Date supplies delivered or services performed.

      (5) Date that the designated Government official accepted the supplies or services.

      (6) Signature, printed name, title, mailing address, and telephone number of the designated Government
      official responsible for acceptance or approval functions.

(e) Payment office.

The designated payment office will annotate each invoice and receiving report with the actual date it receives the invoice.

(f)  Payments.

      (1)  The Government will not make invoice payments earlier than 7 days prior to the due dates specified
      in the contract unless the agency head determines:

             (i) To make earlier payment on a case-by-case basis; or

             (ii) That the use of accelerated payment methods are necessary (see 32.903(a)(5)).

      (2) The designated payment office:

             (i) Shall make payments under this contract by electronic funds transfer (EFT) through
             the Automated Clearing House (ACH).  Payments made by EFT will specify a date on or before the
             established due date for settlement of the payment at a Federal Reserve Bank;

             (ii) When the due date for payment falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Government
             offices are closed, may make payment on the following working day without incurring a late
             payment interest penalty.

             (iii) When it is determined that the designated billing office erroneously rejected a proper invoice
             and upon resubmission of the invoice, will enter in the payment system the original date the invoice
             was received by the designated payment office for the purpose of calculating the correct payment
             due date and any interest penalties that may be due.

             (iv) When a discount for prompt payment is taken, the designated payment office will make
             payment to the contractor as close as possible to, but not later than, the end of the discount period.
             The discount period is specified by the contractor and is calculated from the date of the contractor's
             proper invoice. If the contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date is calculated
             from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates
             such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. When the discount date falls on a
             Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Government offices are closed, the designated payment
             office may make payment on the following work day and take a discount. Payment terms are
             specified in the clause at 52.232-8, Discounts for Prompt Payment.

(g)  Interest penalties.

       (1) Late payment.

           The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from
           the contractor, when all of the following conditions, if applicable, have been met:

                a. The designated billing office received a proper invoice.

                b. The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing
                payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with
                any contract requirement.

                c. In the case of a final invoice, the payment amount is not subject to further contract settlement
                actions between the Government and the contractor.

                d. The designated payment office paid the contractor after the due date.

                e. In the case of interim payments on cost-reimbursement contracts for services, when payment is
                made more than 30 days after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice.

       (2) Improperly taken discount.

       The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the
       contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The interest penalty is
       calculated on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of
       the discount period through the date when the contractor is paid.

        (3) Failure to pay interest.

             (i)  The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, in addition to the interest penalty
             amount, only if:

                   a. The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more;

                   b. The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date
                   the invoice amount is paid; and

                   c. The contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional
                   penalty payment, postmarked not later than 40 days after the date the invoice amount is paid.

            (ii) Contractors must support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following
           data. The Government must not request additional data. Contractors must:

                  a. Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request
                  payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be
                  required;

                  b. Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest is due; and

                  c. State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt.

            (iii) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible:

                  a. The designated payment office that receives the demand will  annotate it with the date of
                  receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or

                  b. If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will
                  determine the demand's validity based on the date the contractor has placed on the demand;
                  provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made.

        (4) Disagreements.

             (i) The payment office will not pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement
             between the Government and contractor concerning:

                  a. The payment amount;

                  b. Contract compliance; or

                  c. Amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract.

           (ii) The Government and the contractor must resolve claims involving disputes, and any interest that
           may be payable in accordance with the Disputes clause.

        (5) Computation of interest penalties.

        The Government will compute interest penalties in accordance with OMB prompt payment regulations
        at 5 CFR Part 1315. These regulations are available via the Internet at
        http://www.fms.treas.gov/prompt/.

        (6) Unavailability of funds.

        The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely payment does not relieve an agency from the
        obligation to pay interest penalties

(h) Contractor inquiries.

      (1) Questions regarding delinquent payments should be directed to the designated payment office; and

      (2) Disagreements in the payment amount or any timing issue should be directed to the Contracting
      Officer for resolution.  The Contracting Officer is the only one that can resolve any disagreements.

      (3) Small business concerns may contact the agency's local small business specialist or representative
      from the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization to obtain additional assistance related
      to payment issues, late payment interest penalties, and information on the Prompt Payment Act.

    (b) Upon Covered Entity's knowledge of a material breach by Business Associate, Covered Entity shall
    either:

         (1) Provide an opportunity for Business Associate to cure the breach or end the violation consistent
        with the termination terms of this Contract.  Covered Entity may terminate this Contract for
        default if the Business Associate does not cure the breach or end the violation within the time
        specified by Covered Entity; or

        (2) Consistent with the terms of this Contract, terminate this Contract for default if Business Associate
        has breached a material term of this Contract and cure is not possible; or

        (3) If neither termination nor cure is feasible, Covered Entity shall report the violation to the
        Secretary.

   (c) Effect of Termination

        (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (2) of this section, if for any reason this contract is
        terminated, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from Covered Entity, or
        created or received by Business Associate on behalf of Covered Entity. This provision shall apply to
        PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of Business Associate. Business Associate
        shall retain no copies of the PHI.

 (2) In the event that Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible,             Business Associate shall
provide to Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return             or destruction infeasible.  Upon such notice that return
or destruction of PHI is infeasible, Business             Associate shall extend the protections of this Contract to such PHI and limit further
uses and             disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long              as
Business Associate maintains such PHI.

H.11  CMS INFORMATION SECURITY (APRIL 2008)




This clause applies to all organizations which possess or use Federal information, or which operate, use or have access to Federal information
systems (whether automated or manual), on behalf of CMS.

The central tenet of the CMS Information Security (IS) Program is that all CMS information and information systems shall be protected from
unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, modification, diversion, destruction, loss, misuse, or theft; whether accidental or intentional.
The security safeguards to provide this protection shall be risk-based and business-driven with implementation achieved through a multi-layered
security structure.  All information access shall be limited based on a least-privilege approach and a need-to-know basis, i.e., authorized user
access is only to information necessary in the performance of required tasks.  Most of CMS' information relates to the health care provided to
the nation's Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and as such, has access restrictions as required under legislative and regulatory mandates.

The CMS IS Program has a two-fold purpose:

(1) To enable CMS' business processes to function in an environment with commensurate security protections, and
(2) To meet the security requirements of federal laws, regulations, and directives.
The principal legislation for the CMS IS Program is Public Law (P.L.) 107-347, Title III, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002
(FISMA), http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf.  FISMA places responsibility and accountability for IS at all levels within
federal agencies as well as those entities acting on their behalf.  FISMA directs Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the Department
of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to establish the standards and guidelines for federal agencies in
implementing FISMA and managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information systems.  As a contractor acting on behalf
of CMS, this legislation requires that the Contractor shall:

-     Establish senior management level responsibility for IS,
-     Define key IS roles and responsibilities within their organization,
-     Comply with a minimum set of controls established for protecting all Federal information, and
-     Act in accordance with CMS reporting rules and procedures for IS.

Additionally, the following laws, regulations and directives and any revisions or replacements of same have IS implications and are applicable
to all CMS contractors.

-     P.L. 93-579, The Privacy Act of 1974, http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm , (as amended);
-     P.L. 99-474, Computer Fraud & Abuse Act of 1986,   www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/ccmanual/01ccma.pdf   P.L. 104-13, Paperwork
Reduction   Act of 1978, as amended in 1995, U.S. Code 44 Chapter 35, www.archives.gov/federal- register/laws/paperwork-reduction;
-     P.L. 104-208, Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (formerly known as the Information Technology     Management Reform Act),
http://www.cio.gov/Documents/it_management_reform_act_Feb_1996.html;
-     P.L. 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (formerly known as the     Kennedy-Kassenbaum Act)
http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/pl104191.htm;
-     OMB Circular No. A-123, Management?s Responsibility for Internal Control, December 21,    2004,
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a123/a123_rev.html;
-     OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Transmittal 4, November  30, 2000,
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130trans4.html;
-     NIST standards and guidance, http://csrc.nist.gov/; and,
-     Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations, policies, standards and guidance    http://www.hhs.gov/policies/index.html

These laws and regulations provide the structure for CMS to implement and manage a cost-effective IS program to protect its information and
information systems.  Therefore, the Contractor shall monitor and adhere to all IT policies, standards, procedures, directives, templates, and
guidelines that govern the CMS IS Program, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/informationsecurity and the CMS System Lifecycle Framework,
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework.

The Contractor shall comply with the CMS IS Program requirements by performing, but not limited to, the following:
-     Implement their own IS program that adheres to CMS IS policies, standards, procedures, and      guidelines, as well as industry best
practices;
-     Participate and fully cooperate with CMS IS audits, reviews, evaluations, tests, and assessments of  contractor systems, processes, and
facilities;
-     Provide upon request results from any other audits, reviews, evaluations, tests and/or assessments   that involve CMS information or
information systems;
-     Report and process corrective actions for all findings, regardless of the source, in accordance with       CMS procedures;
-     Document its compliance with CMS security requirements and maintain such documentation in       the systems security profile;
-     Prepare and submit in accordance with CMS procedures, an incident report to CMS of any    suspected or confirmed incidents that may impact
CMS information or information systems; and
-     Participate in CMS IT information conferences as directed by CMS.

If the contractor believes that an updated IS-related requirement posted to the CMS website may result in a significant cost impact, the
contractor may submit a request for equitable cost adjustment before implementing change.

I.4   FAR 52.204-1 APPROVAL OF CONTRACT (DEC 1989)

I.5   FAR 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (MAY 2008)


(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—
      (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals—
           (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
           Federal agency;


           (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against
           them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public
           (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of
           offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax
           evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;


           (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of
           any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;


           (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount
           that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
                 (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:


                       (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is
                       not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to
                       the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.


                       (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax
                       liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action
                       is precluded.


                 (2) Examples.


                       (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek
                       Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.
                       Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all
                       judicial appeal rights.


                       (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been
                       issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting
                       the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of
                       the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior
                       opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the
                       taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
                       appeal rights.


                       (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely
                       payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not
                       currently required to make full payment.


                       (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action
                       is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


      (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
      Federal agency.


    (2) “Principals,” for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary management
    or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business
    segment, and similar positions).


    This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or
    Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.


(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-
responsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.




I.6   FAR 52.215-19 NOTIFICATION OF OWNERSHIP CHANGES (OCT 1997)


(a) The Contractor shall make the following notifications in writing:

      (1) When the Contractor becomes aware that a change in its ownership has occurred, or is certain to occur, that could result in changes in
      the valuation of its capitalized assets in the accounting records, the Contractor shall notify the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO)
      within 30 days.

      (2) The Contractor shall also notify the ACO within 30 days whenever changes to asset valuations or any other cost changes have occurred or
      are certain to occur as a result of a change in ownership.

(b) The Contractor shall-

      (1) Maintain current, accurate, and complete inventory records of assets and their costs;

      (2) Provide the ACO or designated representative ready access to the records upon request;

      (3) Ensure that all individual and grouped assets, their capitalized values, accumulated depreciation or amortization, and remaining useful
      lives are identified accurately before and after each of the Contractor’s ownership changes; and

      (4) Retain and continue to maintain depreciation and amortization schedules based on the asset records maintained before each Contractor
      ownership change.

c) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract that meet the applicability requirement of
   FAR 15.408(k).


I.7   FAR 52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)

I.9   FAR 52.223-13 CERTIFICATION OF TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASE REPORTING (AUG 2003)

(a) Executive Order 13148, of April 21, 2000, Greening the Government through Leadership in Environmental Management, requires submission of
this certification as a prerequisite for contract award.

requirements described in section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) (42 U.S.C. 11023) and
section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA) (42 U.S.C. 13106), the offeror will file and continue to file for such facilities for

K.4   FAR 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (MAY 2008)


      (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -


                 (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -


                       (A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of
                       contracts by any Federal agency;


                       (B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment
                       rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain,
                       or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of  Federal or state antitrust
                       statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or
                       destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen
                       property;


                       (C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with,
                       commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and


                       (D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes
                       in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.


                            (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:


                                  (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A
                                  liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of
                                  a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights
                                  have been exhausted.


                                  (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay
                                  the tax liability when full payment  was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced
                                  collection action is precluded.


                            (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which
                            entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it
                            is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability
                            until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.


                                  (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer
                                  has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS
                                  Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to
                                  sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax
                                  liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent
                                  tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a
                                  final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.


                                  (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is
                                  making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent
                                  because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.


                                  (iv)The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced
                                  collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


                 (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for
                 default by any Federal agency.


           (2) "Principals," for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary
           management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary,
           division, or business segment, and similar positions).

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or
Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.


      (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror
      learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.


      (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award
      under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility.
      Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render
      the Offeror nonresponsible.


      (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good
      faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed
      that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.


      (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making
      award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to
      the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.






K.5   FAR 52.230-2 COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (OCT 2008)


  (a) Unless the contract is exempt under 48 CFR 9903.201-1 and 9903.201-2, the provisions of 48 CFR Part 9903 are incorporated herein by
  reference and the Contractor, in connection with this contract, shall—


    (1) (CAS-covered Contracts Only) By submission of a Disclosure Statement, disclose in writing the Contractor’s cost accounting practices as
    required by 48 CFR 9903.202-1 through 9903.202-5, including methods of distinguishing direct costs from indirect costs and the basis used for
    allocating indirect costs. The practices disclosed for this contract shall be the same as the practices currently disclosed and applied on
    all other contracts and subcontracts being performed by the Contractor and which contain a Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) clause. If the
    Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that the Disclosure Statement contains trade secrets and commercial or financial information
    which is privileged and confidential, the Disclosure Statement shall be protected and shall not be released outside of the Government.


    (2) Follow consistently the Contractor’s cost accounting practices in accumulating and reporting contract performance cost data concerning
    this contract. If any change in cost accounting practices is made for the purposes of any contract or subcontract subject to CAS
    requirements, the change must be applied prospectively to this contract and the Disclosure Statement must be amended accordingly. If the
    contract price or cost allowance of this contract is affected by such changes, adjustment shall be made in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)
    or (a)(5) of this clause, as appropriate.


    (3) Comply with all CAS, including any modifications and interpretations indicated thereto contained in 48 CFR Part 9904, in effect on the
    date of award of this contract or, if the Contractor has submitted cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as shown on
    the Contractor’s signed certificate of current cost or pricing data. The Contractor shall also comply with any CAS (or modifications to CAS)
    which hereafter become applicable to a contract or subcontract of the Contractor. Such compliance shall be required prospectively from the
    date of applicability to such contract or subcontract.


    (4)(i) (Agree to an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract if the contract cost is affected by a change
    which, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this clause, the Contractor is required to make to the Contractor’s established cost accounting
    practices.


      (ii) Negotiate with the Contracting Officer to determine the terms and conditions under which a change may be made to a cost accounting
      practice, other than a change made under other provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this clause; provided that no agreement may be made under
      this provision that will increase costs paid by the United States.


      (iii) When the parties agree to a change to a cost accounting practice, other than a change under subdivision (a)(4)(i) of this clause,
      negotiate an equitable adjustment as provided in the Changes clause of this contract.


    (5) Agree to an adjustment of the contract price or cost allowance, as appropriate, if the Contractor or
    a subcontractor fails to comply with an applicable Cost Accounting Standard, or to follow any cost accounting practice consistently and such
    failure results in any increased costs paid by the United States. Such adjustment shall provide for recovery of the increased costs to the
    United States, together with interest thereon computed at the annual rate established under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code
    of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) for such period, from the time the payment by the United States was made to the time the adjustment is
    effected. In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the increased cost to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant
    contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless the Contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or
    should have been aware at the time of price negotiations and which it failed to disclose to the Government.


  (b) If the parties fail to agree whether the Contractor or a subcontractor has complied with an applicable CAS in 48 CFR 9904 or a CAS rule or
  regulation in 48 CFR 9903 and as to any cost adjustment demanded by the United States, such failure to agree will constitute a dispute under
  the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 601).


  (c) The Contractor shall permit any authorized representatives of the Government to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or
  records relating to compliance with the requirements of this clause.


  (d) The Contractor shall include in all negotiated subcontracts which the Contractor enters into, the substance of this clause, except
  paragraph (b), and shall require such inclusion in all other subcontracts, of any tier, including the obligation to comply with all CAS in
  effect on the subcontractor’s award date or if the subcontractor has submitted cost or pricing data, on the date of final agreement on price as
  shown on the subcontractor’s signed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data. If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which
  pursuant to 48 CFR 9903.201-2 is subject to other types of CAS coverage, the substance of the applicable clause set forth in subsection 30.201-
  4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be inserted. This requirement shall apply only to negotiated subcontracts in excess of $650,000,
  except that the requirement shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts otherwise exempt from the requirement to include a CAS clause as
  specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1.

52.217-4 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS EXERCISED AT TIME OF CONTRACT AWARD. (JUN 1988)


M. 2  BASIS FOR AWARD BASED ON BEST VALUE




(a)  Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers
the greatest value to the Government in terms of technical and price rather than to the proposal offering the lowest price.  The Government
reserves the right to select which proposal offers the greatest value to the Government.  The resulting contract will be awarded on the basis of
the proposal from the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be most advantageous to the Government
all factors considered.

(b) Evaluation factors other than cost are technical understanding, key personnel and staffing plan, management plan and past performance.

(c)  The offeror's proposal will be in the form prescribed by this solicitation and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified in
Section L which affects the evaluation factors for award


M. 3  BASIS FOR AWARD BASED ON BEST VALUE (ALTERNATE I)




Costs will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism.  Cost realism pertains to the offeror's ability to project costs which are reasonable and
which indicate that the offeror understands the nature of the work to be performed.  Any understatement or overstatement of costs, whether in
labor hours, labor rates, overhead rates and other direct costs, may be considered a reflection of a lack of understanding of the work required
and may be considered in the technical analysis which could reduce the technical rating.


M. 4  INDIRECT COST CEILINGS




Offerors are advised that the Government will evaluate the offerors' cost proposal accordingly.  The decision to propose indirect cost ceilings
is the Government's.  Offerors' proposed indirect cost ceilings may be incorporated into any resultant contract without discussion.  Under this
cost-reimbursement contract, the indirect cost rates billed shall be limited to the ceiling rate(s) identified in the contract.  Any costs
incurred above the indirect cost ceiling rates will not be allowable.


M. 5  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD (SERVICES)




a)  General.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are cautioned that their initial
offer should contain the best terms from a technical and a cost or price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct
discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The failure of an offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement
of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition.  One Contractor will be
selected for award on the basis of its proposal being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

(b)  Evaluation Methodology

All evaluation factors other than Price/Cost, when combined, are significantly more important than Price/Cost.  The evaluation factors,
technical understanding, key personnel and staffing plan, management plan and past performance are:

Exceptional Offeror’s proposal demonstrated exceptional understanding of the requirements and its approach significantly exceeds performance or
                 capability standards.  It has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.

Very Good   Offeror’s proposal demonstrates a very good understanding of the requirements, and its approach exceeds performance or capability
                 standards.  It has one or more strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.

Acceptable  Offeror’s proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the requirements, and its approach only marginally meets performance
                 or capability standards.  Acceptable solution.  Few or no strengths.

Marginal    Offeror’s proposal demonstrates a shallow understanding of the requirements and its approach only marginally meets performance or
                 capability standards necessary for minimal but acceptable contract performance.

Unacceptable     Fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Requirements can only be met only with major changes in the proposal.


(c) Evaluation of Technical Proposal

The evaluation of the technical proposal will be performed by a Technical Evaluation Panel (TEP) in accordance with the methodology set forth in
Section M.5. Proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the methodology and criteria set forth herein to determine the offeror’s ability to
complete all technical requirements for conducting the proposed effort.

To determine a rating for each offeror, the TEP will identify each proposal’s strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies.  The Government will
consider the degree to which the offeror demonstrates its ability to meet or exceed the requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW) as they
relate to the evaluation factors.  The TEP will evaluate the offeror’s proposal against the evaluation factors listed below:

A. Technical Understanding

The Offeror’s written proposal shall be evaluated on their ability to demonstrate the following:

   1. Written proof of a CMMI Level II Certification (SCAMPI Report) or higher.


   2. Knowledge and experience with web based Java development.

   3. Knowledge and experience with development in a 3-tier environment.

   4. Knowledge and experience with oracle database management and systems development.

   5. Knowledge and experience with SQL Server database management.

   6. Knowledge and experience with the following COTS products: BEA Weblogic, DataMirror, COGNOS ReportNet, Sun Identity Management Suite, JAVA,
      JVM, J2EE, Novell/Netware.

   7. An understanding of the following programs (with subcontractor support if necessary) and the interrelationship between applications,
      warehouses/database, reports, and websites components.
        a. Renal Management Information System (REMIS)
        b. Standard Information Management System (SIMS)
        c. Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb)
        d. QualityNet Identify Provisioning System (QIPS)

   8. Experience (with positive references) working on a multi-contractor project.

   9. Knowledge and experience with System Development Life Cycle.

  10. Knowledge and experience with Federal Information Systems Security Standards.

B. Key Personnel and Staffing Plan


Key personnel and staff will be evaluated on:

   1. The extent to which they possess the appropriate technical knowledge, expertise, and experience on the programs and issues described in the
      Statement of Work (Section C).
   2. The ability to provide a clear demonstration that they are available and dedicated (specify a percentage of time) to this effort and will
      meet the needs of the CMS customer
   3. Ability to conduct and manage all of the areas described in the Statement of Work (Section C); and the ability to organize and manage
      complex contracts, government and/or commercial.
   4. The contractor’s ability to meet the following requirements:

      • Senior Management –Seven plus years of progressive experience managing complex applications development projects for the Federal
        Government;


      • Project Director –Seven plus years of progressive experience managing successful technology design, implementation, and support tasks
        and leadership through the full system development life cycle;


      • Lead Applications Developer – Five plus years of applications development experience on web applications and three plus years experience
        leading the technical aspects of applications development projects through the full system development life cycle.

Offerors shall provide resumes of all key personnel for this contract.  The total number of proposed key personnel shall not exceed eight
individuals.

C. Management Approach

The management approach will be evaluated based on the Offeror’s ability to provide

   1. A management team with experience and knowledge relative to operation of the services identified in the Statement of Work (Section C).


   2. An effective approach to planning, organizing, and executing the contract activities as presented in the Statement of Work (Section C).

   3. An organizational structure that has appropriate disciplines grouped, clear lines of authority, communication, and responsibility.

D.  Past Performance

Under the Past Performance Factor, the Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon the quality of the offeror’s past
performance as it relates specifically to the scope of work for this RFP, as well as that of its proposed teaming partners/major subcontractors,
and to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.  When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its
inquiry on the past performance of the offeror and its teaming partners/major subcontractors, and subcontractors regarding all solicitation
requirements.  This assessment will include the offeror’s record on cost, schedule, and performance, as well as its history for reasonable and
cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction.  The Government will also assess the degree to which the offeror’s past
performance demonstrates the capability to provide timely, high quality and responsive standard work products, deliverables, artifacts,
templates, and performance measures consistent with projects milestones and checkpoint (gate) reviews.

Past performance information may be obtained through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), similar systems of other federal
(or State) Government departments and agencies, questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of this acquisition, CMS channels, interviews with
program managers and contracting officers and other sources known to the Government, including commercial sources.  When assessing the offeror’s
past performance, the Government may contact other sources of information, including but not limited to, better business bureaus, previous
customers, other contractors who have worked with the offeror (but not bidding with the offeror in this procurement), and published media.  In
conducting this assessment, the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by each offeror and data obtained from other sources.

If the offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance or if information about the offeror’s past performance is not available, then
the Government will not evaluate the offeror’s past performance favorably or unfavorably.  Offerors demonstrating successful completion of
relevant recent projects will be given more credit in this factor.

Business Proposal:

The business proposal will not be point scored.  CMS will evaluate the Business Proposal to assess CMS' level of confidence in the offeror's
ability to deliver efficient, risk free performance at a fair and reasonable cost.  In that regard, the evaluation will focus on the offeror’s
indirect rate history, accounting system adequacy, within budget history, time and material rate loadings, and projected future direct labor
rate and indirect cost rate stability and competitiveness.

CMS will use the following ratings to evaluate the Business Proposal and determine the associated risk to the Government:

GREEN            CMS believes the Business Proposal represents low risk.  E.g., the accounting                   system for the prime
contractor, as well as subcontractors, is adequate for all                     pricing arrangement contemplated under this contract, future
indirect costs appear to                be predictable, and proposed pricing for labor appears reasonable.

YELLOW      CMS believes there is some risk in the Business Proposal.  E.g., the accounting                      system for the prime
contractor, or subcontractors, may not be adequate for all                     pricing arrangement contemplated under this contract; future
indirect costs may not                  appear to be predictable, and the proposed pricing for the labor may not appear to             be
reasonable.

RED         CMS believes there is substantial risk in the Business Proposal.  E.g., the                    accounting system for the prime
contractor, or subcontractors, is not adequate for                  all pricing arrangement contemplated under this contract, future indirect
costs do not                 appear to be predictable, and the proposed pricing for the labor does not appear to                  be reasonable.

(d)  Although, The business proposal will not be scored using adjectival ratings.  The business and cost/price proposal will be analyzed and
evaluated by a separate business evaluation committee to determine the reasonableness and the realism of the proposed cost/price. The purpose of
this cost realism analysis will be to determine if the offeror’s proposed costs reflect the offeror’s understanding of the Government’s
requirements, and if the proposed costs are consistent with the various elements of the offeror’s technical proposal.

CMS reserves the right to award without holding discussions.  However, in the event that an offeror is precluded from receiving award or being
excluded from the competitive range solely based upon a negative past performance rating, then CMS shall provide an opportunity for the offeror
to refute its negative past performance.

(e) Risk: In determining Best Value, CMS will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror’s proposal and potential performance.

The CMS will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror’s proposal and potential performance. Risk is defined as the likelihood that
the Government will be negatively impacted by the offeror’s failure to meet the negotiated business, technical, management, and schedule
performance and cost. Risk is associated with an offeror’s proposed approach in meeting the Government’s needs and requirements.  The evaluation
team will assess risk and integrate their assessment into the rating of each evaluation factor and appropriate sub factor.

Assessment of risk is an integral component of the evaluation. It will serve to inform the evaluators of the likelihood that the offeror’s
proposed solutions would successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation, within reasonable time frames and funding profiles, without
placing unreasonable risk on the Government. In analyzing the risk of the offeror’s proposed solutions, the Government will also consider the
offeror’s willingness to share in this risk.

(f) Selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 15.6, Source Selection.
Selection will be made of that responsible offeror(s) whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government
based on technical merit, cost/price realism and other factors specified in this solicitation.

(g) The TEP will recommend whether a proposal is technically acceptable or technically unacceptable; its strengths, weaknesses and deficiencies;
discriminators; and risks.

(h) The technical proposal shall provide all information necessary to properly evaluate the proposals in accordance with the evaluation
criteria. The Contracting Officer may request clarifying information from an offeror, if required to complete the initial technical evaluation.
An offeror should not assume that the Contracting Officer will independently obtain information necessary to evaluate its proposal and should
therefore supply all information required to evaluate its proposal. Failure to provide the information required to evaluate a proposal could
result in rejection of the proposal as being technically unacceptable.

(i) In the event option periods are provided for in this solicitation, evaluation of the option periods will be conducted pursuant to FAR 52.217-
5 Evaluation of Options.

(j) CMS reserves the right to make a single award or multiple awards, but anticipates making a single award.  In addition, the RFP may be
amended or canceled as necessary to meet CMS requirements.

(k) Competitive Range:  Based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria and other requirements of the solicitation, the
Contracting Officer shall establish a Competitive Range for the single contract comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals unless the
range is reduced for purposes of efficiency (see below) or unless award is made without discussions.  The Competitive Range will be determined
based on the following:

 • Adjectival rating of the written technical proposal(s);
 • Evaluation of the business proposal; and
 • A preliminary responsibility determination (See FAR 9.1 Responsible Prospective   Contractors).  Note:  At this point in the procurement cycle
   the responsibility determination is preliminary.  The responsibility determination process will continue up to the time of award.

Further, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the Competitive Range exceeds the number
at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the Competitive Range to the
greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

Offerors will be notified by letter whether or not it has been included in the Competitive Range.  Offerors not in the Competitive Range will be
eliminated from further consideration for award.  Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the Competitive Range may request a debriefing
in accordance with FAR 15.505, Pre-award Debriefing of Offerors.

(l) Discussions:  After announcement of the Competitive Range and upon completion of discussions in accordance with FAR 15.3, a request for
final revised proposals will be issued to all Offerors still within the Competitive Range.  If, after discussions have begun, an Offeror
originally in the Competitive Range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated Offerors being considered for award, that Offeror
may be eliminated from the Competitive Range whether or not all material aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or whether or not the
Offeror has been afforded an opportunity to submit a proposal revision.

After receipt and evaluation of a final revised proposal, an Offeror may be selected for award and may be involved in final negotiations.  The
content of such negotiations would not have any bearing on the selection process and would be in accordance with HHSAR 315-370, “Finalization of
details with the selected source.”

However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to make award of a contract(s) without regard to “discussions.” If the Government awards
without discussions, a competitive range will not be established.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Offeror to submit the most
advantageous proposal to the Government with the initial submission.

You are reminded that inclusion in the Competitive Range is not a guarantee for award of a contract.  Offeror’s eliminated from the Competitive
Range will be notified in accordance with FAR 15.503, Notice to Unsuccessful Offerors.

(m) Source Selection:   Source selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and The
Department of Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulations (HHSAR) and this solicitation.  Award of the contract under this solicitation
shall be made to the contractor(s) whose proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government.[pic]
