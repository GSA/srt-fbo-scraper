Government Product Accessibility Template 
(GPAT)

The GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement 
officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 
508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government 
solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their 
proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable 
Section 508 requirements. The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The 
first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, 
corresponding to the six technical sections, the functional performance 
criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as 
defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables 
correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables 
and labor hours, respectively.

NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on   EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based   on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column.   Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the   Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this   acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or   service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to   any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified   program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide   appropriate accessibility information.

Please fill the information below as a part of request for accessibility 
information of your proposed deliverable.
