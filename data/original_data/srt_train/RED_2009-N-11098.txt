(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these
offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds
$3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a
proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the
Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax
liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for
these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-

Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
