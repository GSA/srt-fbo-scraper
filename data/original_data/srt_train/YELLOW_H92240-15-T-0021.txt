                                                            PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
                                               NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE (NSW) WARRIOR & FAMILY WEBSITE
                                                           BUILD, HOST, AND MAINTENANCE

1.  INTRODUCTION

      1.1 Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Command, hereafter referred to as the Government, requires a new
hosted secure .org website for purposes of information exchange between active duty members to include leadership and families of members.
While content is not classified, due to the nature of the command mission, it is considered sensitive.  Examples of content include:  updates on
NSW initiatives, information about NSW events and NSW-specific resources, testimonials about use of resources, and dialogues within the
community on topics such as new spouse support and mentorship, dealing with stress, unmet needs, and attributes of top leadership.  In addition
to NSW-specific information, the website provides Navy/Department of Defense (DoD) and civilian/local resource information.  Most of the
information is accessed via links (to other websites) and documents (e.g., PDFs, JPEGs).  In addition to security elements, the website requires
an automated registration and re-fresh process which validates a registrant’s affiliation with NSW.

           1.1.1 The Contractor shall be responsible for all elements of the new website:  hosting to include
identifying the location; build maximally utilizing SharePoint 2013 and the background/look and feel and user navigation basics associated with
NSW’s existing website (www.nswfamily.org); website achievement and sustainment of security elements related to the DoD Risk Management
Framework process; establishment of two real-time identification and authentication utilizing attributed-based access control with a tie-in to
the  Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) via the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), and on-going maintenance of the site’s
functions.

      1.2  The NSW Warrior and Family Website’s primary purpose is to offer a secure, easy to navigate and cost effective means for obtaining and
exchanging quality NSW and other pertinent information.  Quality vs. quantity is the intent.   As an example, the approximate size of the
current NSW Family Website is as follows:  Web:  6GB;  File:  16 GB; DB:  11 GB.  While the current website has a handful of videos on it,
expectation is that there will be more videos streaming from the new website within the SharePoint parameters,  however, most will stream from
external sites.  Regarding registrant numbers, the new website registrant capacity is projected at a NTE high count of 10,000.  Average daily
utilization is projected at a VERY high count of 500 registrants.

      1.3  In order to keep costs down in the areas of security, design, and build,  the host location and security
parameters shall meet, not exceed, those set forth in the DOD Risk Management Framework process;  design and functionalities shall be maximally
built using SharePoint; and the website user navigation and layout shall replicate, in large part, that of the existing website.

      1.4  Once the website is built and initial content copied over, the Government will have all administrative privileges regarding SharePoint
and other functionalities and provide registrant, content, and analytics management.  This includes responding to customer queries, monitoring
customer content, adding new content, changing configurations, and running reports identifying registrant traffic patterns (via Google
Analytics).

      1.5  Post-build, the Contractor shall provide on-going maintenance regarding the site’s Security status, tie-ins to DEERS via DMDC, and for
access and functionalities, achieve a 99.5% up time.

2.  SCOPE OF WORK

      2.1  The Government has defined the description and requirements for this effort reducing, substantially,
the need for analysis.  The Contractor shall adhere to the specifications provided in order to expedite the build and contain costs.

           2.1.1 The Contractor shall provide all host and build requirements specified herein.

           2.1.2 The Contractor shall configure the website in accordance with the Defense Information
Security Agency (DISA) Web Server Security Requirements Guide (SRG),  SECNAVINST 5720.44 Department of the Navy Public Affairs Policy and
Regulations, and meet security requirements outlined in DOD 8510.01 DoD Risk Management Framework enabling the Government Authorizing Official
to issue an authority to operate decision on the system.

           2.1.3 The Contractor shall configure the system to enable real-time identification and
authentication utilizing attributed-based access control (tie-in) to Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) via the Defense
Manpower Data Center (DMDC).


           2.1.4  The Contractor shall maximally use Microsoft SharePoint 2014 2013 for the website
build to include video and chat room functionalities.


           2.1.5   The Contractor shall establish connectivity between the website and Google Analytics
(GA) website and configure the GA interface to enable subsequent pull of relevant analytics by Government Website Administrators.

           2.1.6  The Contractor shall establish website accessibility from Government and non-
Government computers and shall build it in a manner that allows effective viewing on almost any device as well as via current and future browser
upgrades.

           2.1.7  The Contractor shall configure the website for content display as follows:  Headquarters
content accessible to all registrants; up to approximately 35 configurable Resource content accessible to all registrants; up to approximately
40 configurable command or specialty content with restricted access; and up to 20 configurable chat rooms with restricted access.  For the
restricted content, registrants gain access based on their affiliation with the specific command or chat room topic.  As part of the website
build, the Contractor shall copy content specified by the Government from the existing NSW Family Website to the new NSW Warrior and Family
website.


           2.1.8  The Contractor shall establish mechanisms for communication from and between website
users and the website to include the ability for the Government Administrators to send messages outward based on specific subscriber lists,
e.g., communicating from the Headquarters location will reach all website registrants while communicating from command, specialty, or chat
rooms, will only reach those who have approved access.

      2.2  The Contractor shall achieve the following objectives.

           2.2.1 Simple & Automated. Through the two tie-ins to the Defense Enrollment Eligibility
Reporting System (DEERS) via the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), registrants’ affiliation with NSW is validated/re-validated enabling
automated and immediate access to the appropriate published command content.

           2.2.2  Speed and Ease:  User Accessibility and Interface. Compliant with DoD Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and mobile, registrants easily view and interact with content via mobile devices and are, maximally, able to access
approved content on the website within 1-2 clicks (e.g., downloads, photos, command and resource content).


           2.2.3 Simple Process:  Content Management & Registrant Management. Through establishment of
templates and processes and via minimal clicks, Government Website Administrators are able to manage content and registrants. This includes the
Administrators’ ability to provide a workaround for registering on the website where the DMDC tie-in will not work.


           2.2.4  Simple Process:  Facilitating Communication.  Through establishment of template and
processes and via minimal clicks, communication between customers/registrants and Government Website Administrators is achieved.  This includes
a Contact Us option for customers (internal and external) to e-mail Government Website Administrators; the ability for Government Administrators
to send messages from the website to subscribers and to set up registration for calendar events.

   3.  REQUIREMENTS

      3.1. A Post-Award conference will be held within five work days of contract award. The Contractor shall provide a written record of the
meeting minutes to the Contracting Officer.

      3.2  Within 3 months of contract award, the Contractor shall:

            3.2.1  Develop, host and maintain an HTTPS .org password-protected (secure) website which is configured In accordance with the
Defense Information Security Agency (DISA) Web Server Security Requirements Guide (SRG) and SECNAVINST 5720.44 Department of the Navy Public
Affairs Policy and Regulations, and meets the system categorization and applicable security controls outlined in DOD 8510.01, Risk Management
Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology.  The Contractor shall manage all aspects of initial and sustained system compliance.

                 3.2.1.1  The Contractor shall develop documentation sufficient for the NSW Authorizing
Official to issue the information system an authority to operate decision per the guidelines outlined in the DOD Risk Management Framework.  The
Government will work with the Contractor’s Information Security Manager to ensure the system is assessed and authorized in accordance with DOD
8510.01.  The Government Information Security System Manager will recommend favorable authority to operate (ATO) once assurance is obtained that
the system is secure and meets all required security guidelines.  The Contractor shall work with the Government to provide required
documentation in support of the annual assessments required in DOD 8510.01.


           3.2.2  Establish two Real-Time Broker Service (RBS) Connections to the Defense Enrollment
Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) via the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), enabling automated validation and re-validation (initial
registration and re-fresh approximately every 6 months) of registrant affiliation with NSW.  The Contractor shall configure, based on the
results of the RBS tie-ins, automated and immediate registrant assignment/reassignment to the appropriate published command content.  DMDC, at
no cost given the website is a Government requirement,  provides protocols for the RBS connections as well as RBS Web Service Definition
Language (WSDL) to assist with coding required to send and receive data, and implement the tie ins.  A Website Process Flow Chart sample and
DMDC Tie In document are contained as Appendix A.

                 3.2.2.1  Initial Registration.  Through the first RBS tie-in, the Contractor shall achieve verification of the new registrant’s
affiliation with NSW based on the Sponsor’s (military member) NSW Unit Identification Code (UIC).  Where affiliation is confirmed, the
registrant shall be prompted to establish a user name and password after which they receive immediate and automatic access to the appropriate
command content based on the approved UIC hierarchy.  The results of all registration attempts shall be displayed within the website.  For the
UIC hierarchy and access to command content, registrants will automatically gain access to no more than 3 command contents, e.g., Headquarters
(Echelon II command visible to all registrants), Echelon III command (if applicable), and Echelon IV command (if applicable).  As an example,
someone validated as affiliated with SEAL TEAM TWO (ST-2), will gain access to all published pages in the ST-2 hierarchy:  ST-2 (Echelon IV),
NSWG-2 (Echelon III), and Headquarters (Echelon II).


                       3.2.2.1.1 The first RBS connection shall be based on the registrant selecting the
NSW command for which they are affiliated and entering minimum personally identifiable information (PII) required by DMDC for the tie-in, e.g.,
name, date of birth, last 4 of Social Security Number (SSN).  The Contractor shall display and implement, within the website, the results of the
connections as follows:  Full Match (registrant gets immediate access to the published command content associated with the applicable UIC
hierarchy); Partial Match (registrant gets immediate access to the Headquarters content and a message that further access is pending);   No
Match (registrant is encouraged to use the Contact Us button to clarify their affiliation).  For the Full and Partial matches, the connection
shall provide the website with the DoD Identification (ID) Numbers, unique DEERS record identifier numbers/non-PII, associated with the
individuals’ DEERS records.  The website shall not retain registrant DOBs or last 4 of the SSNs.

                       3.2.2.1.2  For registrants with Full or Partial Matches, the Contractor shall provide website prompts to assist with
establishment of accounts.  The registrant shall be prompted to (1) Identify their status, e.g., Active Duty, Spouse, Reserve, Gold
Star/Surviving Family Member, or Other,  (2) Establish a unique user name and password that meets required criteria, e.g., 4 digit User Login
and 6-digit password with at least one upper and one lower case letter and one number, and (4) Provide up to two of their preferred method(s)
for communications from the website.  Once the registrant has entered these fields, they shall immediately enter the website.  Future engagement
will require Log-in using the Username and Password.

                 3.2.2.2  Affiliation Re-fresh.  Through the second RBS tie-in, the Contractor shall achieve re-verification of the existing
registrants’ affiliation with NSW and provide automated and revised access to command content, as applicable, e.g., individual will be
automatically unsubscribed to command content no longer in their UIC hierarchy and subscribed to the new applicable content.

                       3.2.2.2.1  The second RBS connection will utilize the DoD ID numbers which
have been retained in the website via the initial RBS tie-in.  Through the second tie-in, they will be sent via DMDC to DEERS on a periodic
basis, e.g., semi-annually.  The connection will return to the website the results related to the UIC match and the website will automatically
update, where applicable, the registrant's profile (affiliated command name) and command content access.  For those who no longer show any
affiliation, the website will identify the applicable records so the Government Website Administrators can delete or take alternative actions.
The Contractor shall display and implement, within the website, the results of the second RBS connection as follows:   No Change (registrant’s
current command content access matches the UIC on the sponsor’s DEERS record); Change (registrant is automatically unsubscribed and/or
subscribed to applicable published command content based on the revised NSW UIC on the sponsor’s DEERS record, and registrants’ profile command
name is updated);  No Match.

      3.2.3  Establish a registration work-around to be used by Government Website Administrators with
individuals authorized to enter the website but unable to do so via the automated method.  The Contractor shall provide a link which, when sent
by Government Website Administrators, enables an individual to reach the account registration steps (establish Username and Password etc.) after
which the Government Website Administrators receive an automated notification prompting them to go to the website to approve the individual’s
registration and give manual access to applicable content. The website shall retain documentation of all users registered via the workaround,
i.e., date registered, name, status, affiliated command (lowest approved command content).

      3.2.4   Establish User Self-Help protocols.

           3.2.4.1  User Profiles.  Registrants shall have access to their account Profile in order to revise their
preferred communication settings, their status, and password when/if necessary.  Registrants shall have the option of identifying up to two
preferred methods for communication both of which shall be acceptable for password re-set requests.

            3.2.4.2  Password Re-Sets.  Registrants shall have access to an automated “Forgot your password?” option within the login section of
the website.  Through this option, they will be prompted to enter an e-mail/text address which is affiliated with their account and, if they do
so, the password re-set instructions will be automatically sent to the provided address in order for the registrant to re-gain access to the
website.

           3.2.4.3  Contact Us Option.  A Contact Us option shall be available to registrants/would-be
registrants to address issues, concerns or suggestions.  When utilized, applicable Government Website Administrators will receive the messages
in order to respond.  The website shall retain documentation of communications both received and sent via this feature.

      3.2.5  Establish Registrant Management Options.  The Contractor shall implement the following capabilities for use by Government Website
Administrators.


              1. Registrant Log.  From within the website, the Contractor shall provide a registrant log,
for viewing and export (excel), showing who have tried to register/registered on the website.  The log shall document all user interface with
the automated website registration process to include the date, name, contact address, and selected command for each separate attempt, e.g., a
person who tried to register 3 times will show up three times with the related information for each attempt.  The log shall also show the
outcome for each attempt:  Full Match (includes name of command requested and the fact it was a match); Partial Match (includes name of command
requested and name of command associated with the tie-in to DEERS), and No Match (includes name of command requested).

                 3.2.5.1.1  From this log, Government Website Administrators shall be able to assign, in one click, those showing Partial
Matches to the approved lowest level command content in the UIC hierarchy.  The website will subsequently give automated access to any
additional published content in the hierarchy, e.g., if the Government Website Administrator selects ST-3, the registrant will automatically be
given access to the published content within the ST-3 hierarchy:  ST-3, NSWG-1, and Headquarters.

            3.2.5.2  User Management and Permissions.  The Contractor shall establish security access control mechanisms to enable Government
Website Administrators to:   (1) Revise user profile information (affiliated command and preferred contact information),  (2) View the user’s
initial registrant date and last log-in date, (3) Assign or remove user access to restricted content (Command, Specialty, and Chat Room), and
(4) Assign Website Administrator permissions.   Government Website Administrator Permission options shall include:  Full Control (includes User
Management) and Subsite (includes content-specific management and use of related subscriber lists).

                 3.2.5.2.1 Subscriber Lists.  For Command/Specialty/Chat Room content to include the
Headquarters content (all subscribers), approved Government Website Administrators shall have access to applicable subscriber list(s) which
include the name, status (e.g., Active Duty or Spouse), and preferred contact information for each registrant able to view the particular
content. The lists shall be exportable (Excel).

      3.2.6  Establish Website Communication Options (External).  The Contractor shall provide manual and
automated notification options enabling Government Website Administrators the ability to send messages from the website to approved content-
specific registrants:  Headquarters  (all registrants);  Command (applicable registrants);  Specialty (applicable registrants); and Chat Rooms
(applicable registrants).  As an example, utilizing this communication option from the Headquarters location will reach all website registrants
while communicating from command, specialty, or chat room contents, will only reach those who have approved access to the particular content.

            3.2.6.1  Manual Option.  Government Website Administrators, for applicable content, shall have the option of sending messages to
subscribers and/or other addressees.  The format for these messages shall include a subject line, body for text, and optional attachment(s).
Records of messages sent shall be retained within the website and viewable for tracking purposes.

            3.2.6.2  Automated Option.  Applicable to all Command, Specialty, and Chat Room content to include Headquarters content, Government
Website Administrators shall be able to select which web parts will trigger an automatic message to the respective registrants when new content
has been posted.  Administrators will also have the option of choosing frequency of the messages (daily, every three days, weekly), and enter a
configurable closing statement which will accompany each automated message.  Records of messages sent shall be retained within the website and
viewable for tracking purposes.

                 3.2.6.2.1 The automated option messages received by the registrants will have a subject
line that alerts to new content tied to the Command/Specialty or Chat Room from which it was sent, e.g., NSW Family Website: New Content Posted
(Naval Special Warfare Group TWO).  The new content visible on the message will include the name of the applicable web part(s) (e.g., Calendar,
Videos, Announcements) and under each one, the related URL(s).  The URLs will open to the specific location within the website - after the
registrant logs-in.

      3.2.7 Establish Calendar and Event Registration Option.  The Calendar display for Command, Specialty, and Chat Rooms shall mirror an actual
calendar and provide a configurable number of event postings which offer a brief summary for each event (e.g., title, description, date, time,
location).  The registrant can then scroll to different months, as needed, and click on any of the specific events to view the additional
detail.

           3.2.7.1  The Contractor shall provide Government Website Administrators the ability to, based on
their rights,  set up event registration from within the calendar functionality, i.e., based on the Administrator’s rights, multiple calendars
may be selected so the registration results are linked and visible from all selected calendars.


                  3.2.7.1.1 When opting for the event registration option, the Government Website Administrator(s) shall have access to fixed and
configurable fields to choose from, e.g., Fixed fields: names of registrants, number of attendees, children ages, whether child care is needed;
Configurable fields: up to ten open text fields enabling event-specific questions such as:  Willing to volunteer?

                 3.2.7.1.2  For the registrants, they have the option to Register for an Event or, once
registered, Cancel Registration which updates the registration information accordingly.  Registrants are also able to view the current total
number of registrants (total number and break out for adults/children) from the applicable calendar(s).

                 3.2.7.1.3  Registrant responses to the event registration option are captured, for
Government Website Administrator viewing, in list format and are exportable (Excel).

      3.2.8  Build the Website Navigation/Layout.  The Contractor shall build the website in a manner that will maximize the Government Website
Administrators’ ability to utilize much of the existing SharePoint 2013 functionalities to manage the website.  The Contractor shall prepare the
website in a manner which enables Government Administrators to, using minimal clicks, create or revise/reconfigure command, specialty, chat
room, and resource content without requiring knowledge of HTML or complex coding,  e.g., add, upload and re-order content;  upload content to
multiple subsites/webparts simultaneously;  revise the layout format; open links in new windows; stream videos from the website as well as
external websites; manually send messages to subscribers; show the date items were posted;  set item release dates; access reports; add RSS
Feeds; manage group permissions; set number of items to be viewed within a web part before user must click Read More;  send out automated alerts
for action or notification of new content; and reconfigure, add or revise web parts to display different content.  The Contractor shall
configure the website in a manner which enables registrants, maximally, to access approved content within 1-2 clicks (e.g., downloads, photos,
videos, chat rooms, command and resource content.)

           3.2.8.1  The Contractor shall configure the website for content display as follows:  Headquarters
content accessible to all registrants; up to approximately 35 configurable Resource content accessible to all registrants; up to approximately
40 configurable command or specialty content with restricted access; and up to 20 configurable chat rooms with restricted access.  For the
restricted content, registrants gain access based on their affiliation with the specific command or chat room topic.  Access is achieved through
the automated protocols (RBS tie-ins) or manually via Government Website Administrators. See Appendix B for sample website views.


                 3.2.8.1.1  Public Facing Content.  The Contractor shall utilize flash photo to provide movement and personalize the site,
however, minimum content is available, i.e., only a few links and disclaimers.  The purpose for this content is to provide a means to Register,
Log-in, or utilize the Contact Us option. See Sections 3.2.4.2 and 3.2.4.3, Appendix A Flow Chart Sample, and Appendix B, Figure 1.

                 3.2.8.1.2  Registration Process.  See Section 3.2.2.1, Appendix A Flow Chart Sample, and Appendix B, Figure 2.   Once the
automated registration process has been completed, the individual gets immediate access to applicable content, i.e., he/she does not have to
repeat entry of the User Name and Password for the initial registration.

                 3.2.8.1.3  Log-in Landing.  Following initial automated registration and at each required
log-in thereafter, registrants will land on the Headquarter content.  This is to maximize visibility of items posted for the entire community.
See Appendix B, Figure 3 for sample content.

                 3.2.8.1.4  Layout.  From the Headquarters as well as all other content/subsites within the
website, registrants shall view a Menu Bar which provides, in drop down format, the individual’s approved Command/Specialty Content and/or Chat
Room(s) (restricted content areas).   For the Resources and Featured Links on the Menu Bar (not restricted), all registrants shall have full
access to the related drop-down content.  See Appendix B, Figure 3 for sample content.

                 3.2.8.1.5  Command Subsite Content.  Command and Specialty content shall be
formatted to accommodate minimum required content as follows:   (1) Configurable banner for the title, Command Logo, and/or other photo or
background,  (2) Contact List for relevant points of contact:  title, name, phone number, e-mail address, (3) Calendar for event postings, and
(4) Two configurable web parts enabling relevant Government Website Administrators to choose the type content to display, e.g.,  Announcement
with a Link; Announcement with a Download and Link; Announcement with a Photo; Video with a Photo.  For items (2), (3), and (4), the template
will default to display up to 5 items posted under each web part before displaying a See More option for the particular item.  See Appendix B,
Figure 4 for sample content.

                                                    QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)
                                               NSW Warrior and Family Website Build and Maintenance


1.0   PURPOSE

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and  applied  document  used  to  make  sure  that  systematic  quality
assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) standards included  in  the  task  order.   The
intent is to ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance standards  set  forth  in  the  documents,  that  the  Government
receives the quality of services called for in the task order and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received.

2.0   AUTHORITY

Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under FAR 52-212-4(a), Inspection/Acceptance, which provides for inspections  and  acceptance  of
the articles, services, and documentation called for in the contract to be accomplished by the  Contracting  Officer  or  their  duly  authorized
representative.

3.0   SCOPE

The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions necessary to achieve the requirements set
forth by the contract.

The QASP is put in place to provide the Government’s surveillance approach for monitoring and managing the contractor’s performance to ensure
the expected PWS outcomes and performance objectives are achieved.

The QASP is not a part of the task order nor is it intended to duplicate the Contractor’s  Management  Plan.   The  Government  may  provide  the
Contractor an information copy of the QASP as an Attachment to the solicitation to support the Contractor’s efforts in developing  its  own  plan
for achieving the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, up-time, security status and other performance requirements in the PWS.

4.0   RESPONSIBILITIES

The Government resources shall have responsibilities for the implementation of this QASP as follows:

    • Contracting Officer – The Contracting Officer ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective  contracting,  ensures  compliance
      with the terms of the task order and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship.  It is the  Contracting
      Officer that assures the Contractor receives impartial, fair and equitable treatment under the task  order.   The  Contracting  Officer  is
      ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor’s performance.

    • Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) – An individual designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to act  as  his/her  authorized
      representative to assist in administering the task order.  The  source  and  authority  for  the  COR  is  the  Contracting  Officer.   COR
      limitations are contained in the written letter of appointment.

    • Technical Assistant (TA) – A TA, when assigned, is an individual designated in writing by the COR to act as their authorized representative
      to assist in administering a contract.  TA limitations are contained in the written letter of appointment.  While the TA  may  serve  as  a
      direct conduit between the Contractor and the COR, he or she is not empowered to  provide  technical  direction  or  clarification  to  the
      Contractor.


5.0   METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE

The below listed methods of surveillance shall be used in the administration of this QASP.

    • Observation by the COR – The COR will have very frequent, almost daily, interface with the website resulting in on-going monitoring of  its
      status and functions.

    • Scheduled Audits and Validations. Applicable NSW Cybersecurity personnel will perform these audits and checks regarding compliance with the
      DOD Risk Management Framework and other related security requirements within the PWS.

    • Customer Feedback.  Customer feedback from website registrants and NSW Website Administrators will be documented and collected by the  COR.




6.0    MONITORING DOCUMENTATION

The government’s QA surveillance, accomplished by the COR and applicable NSW Cybersecurity personnel will be documented as follows:


    • For COR random monitoring and customer feedback collection, issues raised shall be documented via e-mail to the Contractor.

    • For DoD Risk Management Framework requirements achievement and sustainment of Authority to Operate (ATO) shall be documented in  accordance
      with the DoD Risk Management Framework process and provided to the Contractor and COR.

    • The COR will retain a copy of all correspondence pertaining to performance issues and official DoD Risk Management Framework  findings  and
      documentation.






7.0   PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATION


     The Government will use the monitoring methods cited to identify any performance concerns.  The COR may require meetings with the Contractor
     to discuss issues and concerns and will document those concerns, via e-mail, to the Contractor.   Where  applicable  and  per  the  contract
     CDRLs, the Contractor will include the concerns in the applicable CDRL report for tracking to resolution.  If the  contractor  has  not  met
     minimum requirements, they may be asked to develop a corrective action plan to show how and by what date they intend to bring performance up
     to the required levels.

the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or



(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)




(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:



Technical

    • Sub Factor I – Technical Capability
    • Sub Factor II – Management Plan
Past Performance

Price



For the non-price factors, the Technical factor is considered more important than the Past Performance evaluation factor.  The Technical
subfactor of Technical Capability and Mangement Plan are of equal importance.  All non-priced factors when combined are more important than
price.



(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.



FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation  – Commercial Items ADDENDUM



1. Technical Evaluation


For the Technical Evaluation factor and sub-factors, the table identified below entitled “Technical Ratings Table” will be utilized for the
assignment of ratings.  In the execution of the evaluation, both the offerors Technical Capability and Management Plan and the risk related to
the proposed approach will be assessed.



The purpose of the Technical Evaluation factor is to assess the offeror’s technical capability/understanding to perform the requirements and its
management approach to accomplish the Government’s requirements.  The evaluation of risk is related to the assessment of the offeror’s quoted
technical approach.  Risk assesses the degree to which the offeror’s quoted technical approach for the requirements of the solicitation may
cause disruption of schedule, degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight and the likelihood of unsuccessful
contract performance.  Risk will be considered in the evaluation of the respective sub-factors.



A combined Technical/Risk Rating will be utilized in the evaluation of the Technical Evaluation and the combined technical/risk rating includes
consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies in determining technical rating.  Combined technical/risk
evaluations will utilize the combined technical/risk ratings listed below.



Note:  A rating of “Marginal” means that the offeror’s submission is not awardable without a change or changes to the offeror’s submission.  A
offer which receives a “Marginal” rating is not eligible for award if award is made on initial submissions.  Offerors that receive a “Marginal”
rating will be considered to be susceptible to correction if discussions are determined to be in the best interest of the Government.



A rating of “Unacceptable” for the Technical Evaluation Factor means that the offeror’s submission is not awardable and is not susceptible to
correction without what would be tantamount to the submission of an entirely new submission.




Technical Rating Table

|                      |                      |requirements.  Submission contains strengths which far outweigh any weaknesses.  Risk of       |
|                      |                      |unsuccessful performance is low.                                                               |

|                      |                      |requirements.  Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on     |
|                      |                      |contract performance.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.             |
|Yellow                |Marginal              |Submission does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and|
|                      |                      |understanding of the requirements.  The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not      |
|                      |                      |offset by strengths.  Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.                                |
|Red                   |Unacceptable          |Submission does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies.  Submission is    |
|                      |                      |un-awardable.                                                                                  |


2. Past Performance Evaluation


The Government may verify past performance information.  The Government may contact some or all of the references provided, as appropriate, and
may collect information through telephone interviews and existing data sources to include but not limited to the Past Performance Information
Retrieval System (PPIRS).  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and
all sources including sources outside of the Government to be used for evaluation purposes.



The Government reserves the right to consider questionnaires received after the due date of the solicitation and to contact references for
verification of additional information.



Past performance will be evaluated based on the relevance and quality of submitted contracts.



Relevance will be determined by a contract's/task order's similarity to the current requirement, based on scope and magnitude.  For the purposes
of the evaluation, scope and magnitude will be measured by the following:



      Scope:  Experience in the areas defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).



      Magnitude:  The measure of similarity of the dollar value and quantity of work actually performed work that exists between the PWS and the
      offeror's contracts.



In terms of relevancy the offeror's past performance submission will be rated in accordance with the below levels of relevancy:



Past Performance Evaluation Ratings



|Rating                       |Description                                                                                 |
|Very Relevant                |Present/past performance effort involved essentially the                                    |
|                             |same scope and magnitude of effort as this solicitation requires.                           |
|Relevant                     |Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and                                  |
|                             |magnitude of effort as this solicitation requires.                                          |
|Somewhat Relevant            |Present/past performance effort involved some of the                                        |
|                             |same scope and magnitude of effort as this solicitation requires.                           |
|Not Relevant                 |Present/past performance effort involved little or none of                                  |
|                             |the scope and magnitude of effort as this solicitation requires.                            |
|Neutral                      |The offeror has no past performance history OR the KO has determined that the past          |
|                             |performance information provided is not directly related or similar to the requirements in  |
|                             |the RFP.                                                                                    |




Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will receive a Neutral rating.



Each past performance reference under an offeror's Past Performance submission that is determined to be at a minimum "Somewhat Relevant", will
be evaluated to determine the quality of the offeror's performance under

that reference.



Following the quality evaluation, the KO will assign an overall confidence rating to each past performance reference, considering both the
relevance and quality of the provided reference.  The KO will then assign a composite past performance confidence rating for the offeror's
overall past performance, considering the confidence rating assigned to each individual reference.  The KO's confidence evaluation will be in
accordance with the following table:



Past Performance Confidence Assessment Ratings:



|Rating                             |Description                                                                          |
|Substantial Confidence             |Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high |
|                                   |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.          |
|Satisfactory Confidence            |Based on the offeror 's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a     |
|                                   |reasonable expectation that the offeror will                                         |
|                                   |successfully perform the required effort.                                            |
|Limited Confidence                 |Based on the offeror 's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low |
|                                   |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.          |
|No Confidence                      |Based on the offeror 's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no    |
|                                   |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.          |
|Unknown Confidence (Neutral)       |No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance      |
|                                   |record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably|
|                                   |assigned.                                                                            |


3.  Price Evaluation:  Price quotes will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3.  Offerors responding
to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request additional information/data to support price reasonableness
such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar services, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date
and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts.  Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification
of the submitted quote.



The Government may evaluate any and all information submitted by the offeror to support the reasonableness of prices quoted. The method of
evaluation used by the KO is solely within the discretion of the KO.



Options. The Government will evaluate offerors for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the
offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.

(1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain
Services--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and



(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor
Standards wage determination to the solicitation.
