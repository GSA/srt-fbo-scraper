Government Product Accessibility Template for Multifunction Machines


Summary

       • Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each
         Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.
       • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be
         features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable
         includes additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.
       • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
         deliverable.
       • Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
         Standard.
       • Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
         applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.

HE1260-13-R-1014 Page 55 of 67 obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Factor 1 ­ Technical Capability This factor evaluates the offeror's proposed leased copiers and the ability to manage the technical requirements outlined in the PWS as they relate to the below criteria. The Technical Proposal shall provide sufficient information in order for the Government to assess the Offeror's capability to successfully perform the requirements of the PWS. The responses shall be detailed and clearly demonstrate the offeror's understanding of the requirements, nature and scope of the work, and completeness of the approach proposed. A rating of "Unacceptable" f or any subfactor will result in the proposal being deemed Technically Unacceptable and will not be considered for contract award. The following subfactors shall be addressed by the offeror and will be evaluated by the Government as stated below: Subfactor 1) Technical Specifications: The Offeror's proposed copier equipment will be evaluated to determine if the equipment meets the minimum specifications as required by the PWS and accompanying Technical Exhibit 1. Managed Services: The Offeror's approach to managing the services required to ensure proper operation, maintenance and integration of leased equipment in accordance with the PWS. Delivery Plan: The Offeror's Delivery Plan and planned logistical approach to ensuring al l leased copier machines are delivered to each specific location and fully operational as required in Technical Exhibit 1 by 01 April 2013.

Subfactor 2)

Subfactor 3)

Technical Rating Evaluation Process: Technical Rating The technical team shall evaluate the offeror's proposal against the requirements to determine whether the proposal is acceptable or unacceptable using the ratings and descriptions below.

Technical Ratings Acceptable Unacceptable

Definition Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation

(2) Factor 2 ­ Past Performance Evaluation a. This factor evaluates the Offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the Offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the products and services outlined in the solicitation requirements. Recent is defined as contracts/task orders with a performance record of at least one (1) year and are currently on-going or have been

HE1260-13-R-1014 Page 66 of 67 performed within three (3) years from the issuance date of this solicitation. Relevant contracts are those in which the services performed are considered to be the same or similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity when compared to the requirement described in the PWS of this solicitation. b. The Offeror shall provide at least three (3) past performance references. In evaluating past performance, the Government may consider past performance information in the Offeror's proposal, information obtained from questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the acquisition, or any other sources available to the Government, to include but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), other federal databases, references from Program Managers and Contracting Officers, past customers, Government agencies and activities, and other sources deemed necessary. c. Where relevant performance records indicate performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problem(s) and appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken.

Past Performance Evaluation Process: Past Performance shall be used as an evaluation factor in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305 and will be rated on an "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" basis using the ratings below.

Ratings Acceptable

Definition Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort or the offeror's performance record is unknown.* Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Unacceptable

*Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." (3) Factor 3 ­ Price Evaluation Factor Price will not be rated or scored. Price will be evaluated to determine whether it is fair and reasonable and reflects the offeror's understanding of the requirement. This factor will be evaluated IAW FAR 15.305(a)(1) using one or more of the price analysis techniques identified in FAR 15.404-1. The analysis will be conducted on the total price to include the base period and option periods. Cost realism analysis may be used to determine if the price estimates reflect a clear understanding of the requirements. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

HE1260-13-R-1014 Page 67 of 67 Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)
