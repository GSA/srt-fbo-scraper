The Office of Human Resources, Training and Education Division (OHR/TE) arranges and funds course deliveries at a USAID Training Facility in the Washington area and at dozens of overseas locations for Mission staff assigned abroad. As staff levels warrant, Mission's may also directly fund the purchase of core courses for overseas deliveries. All courses are delivered in English. All courses shall be developed and taught in accordance with the requirement set forth in the attached Solicitation. Therefore it is essential that offerors responding to this proposal have the knowledge and understanding of the vast range of factors that are essential when designing and delivering training for USAID staff as described in the attached Request for Proposals (RFP). USAID anticipates one (1) single Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) (no small business setaside), award as a result of this RFP as further described below. This full and open competitive will be exclusively for the implementation of the Office of Human Resources, Training and Education Division.

The prospective offerors shall be obligated to perform work under the awarded task orders and deliver all services within their scope. Each awarded task order shall include a ceiling amount which the contractor shall not exceed. There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractor will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order guarantee set forth in the RFP. A facility clearance is not required under the contract. However, no employee under the contract will be allowed to work in USAID unrestricted office space until a personnel security investigation is completed at the level appropriate for the position per Automated Directive Systems (ADS) 567.

Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished to all prospective offerors via Fedbizopps.gov. There will be no bidders' list. Because the solicitation encourages subcontracting with small businesses and other types of entities, prospective offerors are to view the "Interested Vendor's List" module on FedBizOpps website. A vendor can add its name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, type of business, as well as view this module for prospective teaming arrangements. The solicitation strongly supports subcontracting with small businesses and requires a subcontracting plan with a USAID goals set forth under Attachment J.5 of the Solicitation. Pursuant to Block 12 of Standard Form 33 of this RFP, USAID requires that offers stay valid through March 29, 2013. This RFP in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation or submission of a proposal. Because USAID reserves the right to award a contract without discussions, initial proposals should represent an offeror's best proposal.

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK C.1 INTRODUCTION The Office of Human Resources (OHR), Training and Education Division (TE) of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is responsible for coordinating core and non-core training for the Agency's approximately 8,000 employees. Employees are located in the Washington, D.C. headquarters in the Ronald Reagan Building (RRB), 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C., in annex buildings in the Washington area, and at approximately 85 field offices, referred to as Missions, located overseas. OHR/TE arranges and funds course deliveries at a USAID Training Facility in the Washington area and at dozens of overseas locations for Mission staff assigned abroad. As staff levels warrant, Mission's may also directly fund the purchase of core courses for overseas deliveries. Non-core courses are funded and coordinated by USAID technical bureaus and/or by individual missions as and when needed. These courses are for staff working in a technical sector of the Agency and are in addition to core courses. All courses are delivered in English. All courses shall be developed and taught in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the USAID Forward initiative, USAID Automated Directives System (ADS), USAID ADS policy updates, interim policy updates issued through General Notices, the Code of Federal Regulations 216 as amended, Congressional mandates, Federal Acquisition Regulations, AID Acquisition and Assistance Regulations (AIDAR), host government regulations, and best practices among development practitioners. Therefore it is essential that the Contractor have the knowledge and understanding of the vast range of factors that are essential when designing and delivering training for USAID staff. C.2 GOAL From 2005 through 2011, over 7,000 USAID staff members have completed core training courses to provide them with the knowledge and skills to design, implement, and monitor development activities and to administer grants and contracts. This IQC shall procure the services of a well experienced Contractor capable of designing, developing and delivering adult professional development to USAID employees worldwide through a continuing range of high quality courses, using a combination of web based training, distance learning and instructor led training. Each training, whether instructor led or web based, shall serve to develop the required competencies and skills of Agency staff to produce high quality work as they administer USAID's foreign assistance program. The Contractor shall develop curriculum with the guidance of the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), and in concert with the COR, the contractor shall function as a content expert for the training set forth in this Contract. The Contractor shall be well versed in basic adult learning theory for on-line and in-class training and be able to review training and provide USAID feedback on the training product. USAID will be responsible for and determine the types of updating the training needs based on those recommendations.

C.3

PURPOSE

Each Task Order will include specific requirements for that Task Order; however, the following is a list of the types of services that may be required under this IQC. The listing is only being provided as an example and does not represent any current or known requirement. Specific requirements will be identified in each individual Task Order C.4 REQUIREMENTS The Contractor's duties shall include, but not be limited to, providing technical assistance and advisory services, training delivery, updating existing core Instructor Led and Web Based Training (ILT/WBT), development of new ILT and WBT courses as and when necessary, reproduction of training materials, and support for conference organization and management when ordered. The Contractor shall furnish services that include individuals having experience and expertise, both practical and conceptual, in the subject matter required by each task order. USAID will define its needs in Task Orders, which will be managed by Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) from the tasking Bureau or Mission which shall include both OHR/TE itself as well as other Washington offices and field missions. The Contractor shall provide an expected five years of trainers and developers of web based training, curriculum developers, and managers to effectively implement the full range of stated requirements. C.4.1. Core Courses must fully integrate with one another through the consistent presentation of common topics and through a building block approach to assure a natural progression of knowledge as staff move through the course sequence. Updates to the course content or the redesign of courses (when suggested by the appropriate technical office and approved by the OHR/TE COR) must assure that (1) there is no overlap in content of courses except where desirable for pedagogic purposes; (2) courses effectively integrate blended learning through web based training; (3) courses adhere to adult learning techniques to maximize efficient and enjoyable learning. Course redesigns are not expected sooner than every 12 to 15 months. C.4.2. Non-core courses developed and delivered through Task Orders under this IQC will support the focused technical areas of Bureaus and Independent Offices. When such needs arise, individual Task Orders shall be awarded for the defined task of developing and/or delivering new or existing courses. Although the exact level of new non-core course development and delivery is unknown at this time, under the previous IQC, over 300 deliveries of assorted courses resulted in approximately 7,000 course completions (i.e. an individual completing an instructor led course is a course completion). There is no guarantee as to the number of Task Orders that will be awarded under this IQC. Task Orders will be awarded on an as needed basis. A minimum of TBD and a maximum of TBD may be ordered through Task Orders against this IQC. C.4.3. It is anticipated that additional instructor led and web based courses shall be developed during the life of this IQC. Additional needs will include facilitation of mission retreats overseas and potentially office retreats in Washington.

In addition, the OHR/TE COR shall provide the Contractor, through email, with changes in the Agency regulations and policies that could affect course workbooks. In consultation with the Contractor and the COR, it is the full responsibility of the Contractor's subject matter experts (SMEs) for individual courses to review those releases and determine the relevancy of such content on individual courses. Furthermore, the Contractor shall collaborate with the relevant Agency technical office for each course when determining the relevancy of periodic updates or significant changes in course information. The Contractor shall update individual course curriculums, materials and workbooks as the Federal regulations, Agency guidance, and Automated Directive Systems (ADS) are updated and as a result, affect the material covered in the workbooks. Up to two such revisions at any one time will be considered Routine Revisions. Three or more such revisions at any one time will be considered Minor Revisions. The Contractor shall include Agency regulation and policy changes into the delivery of each course, within 45 calendar days after discovery of policy changes. When Internet access is available in the classroom, the Contractor must ensure that the participants are provided, during the delivery of the courses, one or more demonstration periods that instructs the participants on "how and where to" access the reference materials on-line. Note: typically laptop computers will be provided in the classrooms for projection of PowerPoint slides and other instructional material. However, USAID intranet access will only be available in classrooms at the Washington Training Facility and when courses are conducted at Mission office buildings. Courses conducted at off-site locations (such as hotel conference rooms) will not permit access to the USAID intranet and may not allow access to the Internet. In those instances, the Contractor shall be prepared to show still computer screen shots to convey essential information to course participants. When USAID is unable to assure availability of a laptop computer and/or computer projector, it will be the responsibility of the contractor to provide that equipment in the classroom.

World Wide Training and Other Related Services

One copy of each new task order issued under this IQC must be forwarded to the OHR/TE/COR within one week of receipt by the Contractor. (2) Briefings Within 10 calendar days, prior to completion of each task order or departure from post, if overseas (whichever is earlier), Contractor personnel shall brief the relevant USAID Mission and/or cooperating country officials on the principal activities, accomplishments, and findings during the assignment, unless a briefing is not desired. As requested by the OHR/TE/COR for this IQC, Contractor personnel shall brief OHR/TE upon return from each assignment and provide copies of any documents generated under individual task orders. (g) Development Experience Documentation USAID contractors must submit one electronic and/or one hard copy of development experience documentation (electronic copies are preferred), pursuant to AIDAR 752.7005, to the OHR/TE/COR. h) Other Reporting The contractor shall provide copies of reports, deliverables and outputs required by individual task orders to the OHR/TE IQC COR. Those reports will be defined in individual task orders but may include work plans, quarterly and annual progress reports, and Performance Monitoring and Evaluation plans. i) Linkages to Knowledge Management System USAID Contractors will be required to submit documents into any OHR/TE-maintained knowledge management system. Those requirements will be detailed in individual task order contracts. Designated learning programs will require specific monitoring and evaluation and success story deliverables.

The IQC COR has the authority to approve of a statement of work before it may be issued as a task order under the OHR/TE/ IQC. The IQC COR shall decide which task orders will be subject to the additional M&E guidelines. The Task Order (TO) COR may request assistance from the IQC COR and from the OHR/TE office in designing M&E requirements for individual task orders. At the onset of OHR/TE IQC task orders that have been selected for a more rigorous M&E regime, the Contractor will work closely with the IQC and/or task order COR to devise scientific methods for measuring the impact of the activity and integrating learning moments into work plans, PMPs, and other activities. In applicable task orders, determining the impact of training could entail up to three stages of measurement. For example, participants would complete a pre-training questionnaire and an evaluation immediately after the training. To overcome the halo effect of such evaluations, approximately three to six months after a training, the contractor could also conduct a survey of course participants to 48

USAID SOL-OAA-12-000092

World Wide Training and Other Related Services

determine their retention level and if they were able to apply what they learned in their regular work. However, post training surveys will only be possible if the activity is still on-going. Additional data may be collected to determine if training had an impact on subsequent performance, by comparing expected outcomes in targeted units to appropriate baseline measures and, where possible, outcomes in comparison units. A pipeline approach to compare those who first receive training with those still waiting for training may be appropriate. Participant Training Reports. The contractor shall collect training data on technical trainings (conferences, workshops) provided for beneficiaries that were held in the United States, third countries, or in-country under all task orders. The training data will be submitted to the IQC COR and the task order COR no later than 30 days following the end of each fiscal quarter training course.

(e) All Statements of Work and estimated budgets for prospective task orders must be cleared by the COR for the Basic IQC. F.5 REQUEST FOR TASK ORDER PROPOSAL (RFTOP) (1) Individual task orders shall clearly describe all services to be performed or supplies to be delivered so the full cost or price for the performance of the work can be established when the order is placed. Orders shall be within the scope, issued within the period of performance, and be within the maximum value of the IQC. Only the Contracting Officer for the basic IQC may modify the basic IQC to change the scope, period, or maximum ceiling. (2) The following are the thresholds and corresponding procedures for proposals for task orders: (i) For task orders estimated to be equal to or less than US$100,000: In accordance with the general procedures in (d) above, the Task Order Contracting Officer 49

Representative (TOCOR) will request a task order proposal after coordinating the terms of the RFTOP with the TOCO. The TO COR may not ask for more than a two (2) page cost proposal, and if the TO COR deems it necessary, may also ask for a technical proposal of no more than three (3) pages (page limit does not include resumes, graphs, or past performance information). The TO COR is not authorized to undertake discussions or negotiations with the contractor. After applying the evaluation criteria stated in the request, the TO COR drafts a brief memorandum to the TOCO recommending that the task order be awarded to the contractor that most successfully addresses the evaluation criteria. The TOCO is responsible for final selection, negotiation, and task order award. (ii) For task orders estimated to be more than US$100,000 and equal to or less than US$2,000,000: In accordance with the general procedures in (d) above, the TOCO will request a task order proposal from the contractor.

Once the contractor is selected, the TOCO may ask for a more detailed proposal (technical or cost) if needed. (iii) For task orders estimated to be more than US$2,000,000: In accordance with the general procedures in (d) above, the TOCO will request a task order proposal from the contractor. The TOCO may use the simplified procedure in (d) (ii) above. The TOCO has discretion to decide how much documentation above the minimum set forth above is needed to assess the technical capability and cost of the contractor(s). The contractors interested in being considered for the task order must submit a proposal in accordance with the TOCO's request for task order proposal instructions. The information that the TOCO requests from each contractor must be the minimum needed. (iv) To obtain services or other deliverables that are within the scope of this IQC, the TOCO may issue orders using any of the pricing types specified in the IQC. (v) Contractor must respond to the RFP within the number of calendar days stated in the Request for task order proposal.

This approval is made in writing before the original estimated completion date set forth in the task order and clearly states that the extension is at no additional cost to the task order, Performance must not extend beyond 60 calendar days from the original estimated completion date set forth in the task order, and

Prior to the original estimated completion date, the Contractor must provide a copy of the Task Order Contracting Officer Representative's written approval for any extension to the term of the task order to the TOCO; in addition, the Contractor must attach another copy of the TO COR's approval for such continued performance under the task order to the completion voucher submitted for payment. (5) Right to Procure from Other Sources The Government, under the terms of this IQC, retains the right to procure similar services from other sources during the period of this IQC. (6) Ombudsman If a Contractor believes its organization has not been fairly considered for a particular task order, it may present the matter to the TOCO. If the Contractor disagrees with the TOCO's explanation or decision, it may request a review of the TOCO's decision from USAID's task-order and delivery-order Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is responsible for reviewing complaints from contractors, collecting information from the CO relevant to the complaint, and ensuring that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered under multiple award contracts. The Ombudsman does not have the authority to overturn award decisions or adjudicate formal contract disputes. Information about the Ombudsman review process can be found on the USAID webpage at http://www.usaid.gov/business/ombudsman.html.

H.16. SUBCONTRACTING CONSENT The following list constitutes the approved subcontractors under this IQC: TBD at time of award H.17. REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS The contractor's Representations and Certifications dated _______ which were submitted in response to RFP SOL-OAA-12-000092 are hereby incorporated by reference. H.18. HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) (SEPTEMBER 2006) In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12. HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems. USAID will begin issuing HSPD-12 smart card IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach. Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new smart card IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems. USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007. (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to Oct 27, 2007. In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.) Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo. One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.) USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer. Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems. All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing. The contractor or his/her Facilities Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the IQC, whichever occurs first. The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures, as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPD-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures. This includes 66

USAID SOL-OAA-12-000092

World Wide Training and Other Related Services

HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/ Washington and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office. In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer. The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems. H.19. PROHIBITION OF ASSISTANCE TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS USAID reserves the right to terminate this IQC, to demand a refund or take other appropriate measures if the Contractor is found to have been convicted of a narcotics offense or to have been engaged in drug trafficking as defined in 22 CFR Part 140. H.20. REPORTING OF FOREIGN TAXES (JUL 2007) (a) The contractor must annually submit a report by April 16 of the next year. (b) Contents of Report. The report must contain: (1) Contractor name. (2) Contact name with phone, fax and email. (3) IQC number(s). (4) Amount of foreign taxes assessed by a foreign government [each foreign government must be listed separately] on commodity purchase transactions valued at $500 or more financed with U.S. foreign assistance funds under this agreement during the prior U.S. fiscal year. (5) Only foreign taxes assessed by the foreign government in the country receiving U.S. assistance is to be reported. Foreign taxes by a third party foreign government are not to be reported. For example, if a contractor performing in Losotho using foreign assistance funds should purchase commodities in South Africa, any taxes imposed by South Africa would not be reported in the report for Lesotho (or South Africa). (6) Any reimbursements received by the contractor during the period in (4) regardless of when the foreign tax was assessed and any reimbursements on the taxes reported in (4) received through March 31. (7) Report is required even if the contractor did not pay any taxes during the report period.

(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 87

Technical Acceptability- The Offeror's technical proposal will be evaluated for technical merit according to the criteria set forth in M.3, EVALUATION FACTORS. b. Evaluation of Cost Proposals ­ For the purpose of evaluating the estimated total cost/price proposed by each Offeror, the government will review the Cost/Price Evaluation Sheets (see Attachment (J.13)). Evaluation of the Base Period and Option Period prices will be performed in accordance with FAR 52-217-5 Evaluation of Offers. (a) The Government may award an IQC without discussions with Offerors in accordance with FAR 52.215-1Instructions to Offerors ­ Competitive Acquisition. (b) The Government intends to evaluate Offerors in accordance with Section M of this RFP and make IQC award to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value to the U.S. Government. (c) There is no restriction from submitting a proposal as a prime Offeror, while also being included as a subcontractor under another Offeror's proposal. However, USAID may preclude the inclusion of your firm as a subcontractor to another proposal if both your proposal and the other Offeror's proposal are in consideration for a prime award. If this situation appears likely, during discussions USAID may inquire with the Offeror that has included your firm as a subcontractor to determine how their proposal would be modified should they be required to remove you as a subcontractor in their consortium. (d) The submitted technical information will be rated by a technical evaluation committee using the technical criteria shown below. The evaluation committee may include industry experts who are not employees of the Federal Government. When evaluating the competing Offerors, the Government will consider the written qualifications/capability information provided by the Offerors, and any other information obtained by the Government through its own research. (e) In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price when combined are significantly more important than cost/price factors. (f) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposed by adding the total evaluated price for all option to the total evaluated price for the basic (base year) requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

In addition, it will be evaluated whether the Offeror has received reports indicating a high level of satisfaction from its past clients. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Government will not evaluate favorably or unfavorably on past performance. M.4. COST/BUSINESS EVALUATION/CALCULATIONS Proposed prices will not be scored, but will be evaluated for price realism and reasonableness.

For the purpose of evaluating the estimated total price proposed by each Offeror, Offerors shall complete the worksheets (See Attachment J.13). The Offeror shall include the appropriate work sheets in the cost proposal. Subject to the applicable FAR clause, the total price for all options will be added to the total price for the base period for evaluating offers for award purposes. In addition to above, the Government will conduct a price analysis that will include an evaluation of the reasonableness Offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Items (CLINs) units/extended prices based upon the estimated quantities and the estimated labor hours provided in Section B for the base and option periods. It is noted that the estimated quantities and hours listed are for evaluation purposes only and that the Government is not obligated to order any of the quantities listed. See Attachment J.13. The Government will evaluate the total evaluated cost/price to determine whether it is complete and reasonable. The cost/price analysis will be conducted as described in Section L, and as prescribed in FAR Subpart 15.4.

M.5. DETERMINATION OF COMPETITIVE RANGE (a) The competitive range of Offerors with whom negotiations will be conducted (if necessary) will be determined by the contracting officer pursuant to FAR 15.306(c). A competitive range determination (if necessary) may take place at any point in the evaluation process. (b) Offerors are advised that, in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2), if the contracting officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. M.6. SOURCE SELECTION (a) The overall evaluation methodology set forth above will be used by the contracting officer as a guide in determining which proposal(s) offer the best value to the U.S. Government. In accordance with FAR 15.101-1, and as set forth in Section M of this solicitation, award will be made by the contracting officer to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value to the U.S. Government after evaluation in accordance with all factors and sub-factors in this solicitation.

The following is a suggested model for use when formulating such subcontracting plan. While this model plan has been designed to be consistent with FAR 52.219-9, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable. However, failure to include the essential information as exemplified in this model may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer where the clause is applicable. Further, the use of this model is not intended to waive other requirements that may be applicable under FAR 52.219-9. "SUBCONTRACT" as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.
