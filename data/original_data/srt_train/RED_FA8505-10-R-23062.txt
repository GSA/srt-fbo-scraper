The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

A. This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror's proposal will be made. Among those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, award will be made to the offeror having the

Page 76 of 77 Request for Proposal FA8505-10-R-23062 lowest total evaluated price. The Government intends to make an award without discussions. Discussions, if necessary, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and also provides the best value to the Government based on the results of the evaluation described in paragraph B below. B. The LPTA evaluation process will be accomplished as follows: Technical Acceptability. A. Each offeror's technical proposal shall be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach that meets the requirements of the Performance Work Statement, dated 18 May 2010, paragraphs, 2.1.1.1 (System Availability), 4.0(Each Task ) and 5.0 ( Application Services). Each offeror's technical proposal shall also be evaluated to ensure it demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of those requirements and their associated risks. The offeror must identify risks, if any, associated with the proposed approach and actions the offeror will take to mitigate the identified risks. Evaluations shall include the following: 1. The offeror's Phase-In approach for mobilization of personnel to meet the requirements of the PWS IAW EACH paragraph listed below a. PWS 1.8.1. b. PWS 1.8.2. 2.

The proposal shall include EACH of the following: a. Location of support offices, to include EACH i. Physical address ii. Phone number b. Organization Chart depicting titles and responsibilities 7. Identify risks, if any, associated B. Technical risk will be a part of the criteria considered in the acceptability decision. Technical risk assesses the degree to which an offeror's proposed approach for the requirements of the solicitation may cause disruption of schedule, increased costs, or degraded performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. The evaluation shall address the offeror's identified risks and proposed mitigation (if applicable) and document why that is or is not acceptable. Offers may be determined unacceptable, even though the minimum requirements are met, if the proposed approach poses too great a risk. Cost/Price

Page 77 of 77 Request for Proposal FA8505-10-R-23062 The Offeror's Schedule, Section B, proposed prices will be evaluated for reasonableness and balance. See Paragraphs a) and b) below. Offerors are reminded that in order to maintain reasonable/balanced pricing, the Government will not accept "Not Separately Price (NSP)", No Charge (NC), $0, etc. on any line item other than those already designated "NSP" in the Schedule. Offerors are advised to review all data items and ensure that they are proposing to the specific data requirements and level of effort involved. For data items where the quantity of (1) one lot is specified, the quantity of (1) one shall be used. A Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be calculated in accordance with Paragraph c) below. A. Reasonableness. The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of reasonableness. Price analysis techniques may be used to further validate price reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis of Government obtained information, additional information in accordance with FAR 15.4 may be required to support the proposed price. B. Balance: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items including the Basic and Options, is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of proposal analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether there are unbalanced separately priced line items or sub-line items. Prices submitted will be compared and evaluated to assure that a logical progression exists as related to price and quantity changes within each offeror's response to the pricing structure in the Schedule. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

C. Total Evaluated Price (TEP). All Unit Prices should be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. The Government will calculate a TEP based on the following: For Firm Fixed Price (FFP) CLINs (x001, x002, x004, x006, x008, x010 and x011): Offerors will propose a Unit price for FFP CLINs. The Government will multiply the Quantity by the Unit price to calculate the amount. All FFP CLINs (Basic and Options) will be added together to come up with the TEP. CLIN x015 (Over & above) will not be included in the TEP calculation Note: Cost Reimbursable (CLINs x003, x005, x007, x009, x012, x013 and x014) will not be part of the TEP calculation. CLIN x016 is NSP. Evaluation of Options shall not obligate the Government to award Options.

Implementation of clientprovided hardware and software may be required, depending on the scope and availability of the contractor personnel. Final approval and contractor authorization shall be provided by the

Program Manager (PM) through the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO) for all such items. Any additional incurred cost shall be negotiated in advance and be the sole responsibility of the specific client. 1.6 SYSTEM AND DATA CRITICALITY

1.6.1 System criticality is a measure of the importance of the system and the length of time that the system can be out of operation before loss of the system has an adverse impact on wartime operations or mission responsibilities. The level of criticality depends on the ability to support wartime operations without the system. Categories include: Group I Group II Group III Group IV Group V Mission Critical Mission Essential Mission Impaired Non-mission essential Unassessable System loss would cause immediate stoppage of direct mission support of wartime or contingency operations System Loss would cause an eventual stoppage of direct mission support of wartime or contingency operations. System loss would have an effect on (but would not stop) direct mission support of wartime or contingency operations. System loss would have no effect on direct mission support of wartime or contingency operations. Effect on the mission cannot be judged and falls into other groups when additional information becomes available.

1.6.2 The SPPN network has a criticality factor of Group III ­ Mission Impaired. Loss of system would have a negative effect on, but would not inhibit, direct mission support to wartime operations. 1.7 SECURITY CLASSIFICATION

The security classification of operation for the SPPN network is Sensitive. Even though all the operators shall be privileged operators, not all require the same duties or access privileges. The definition of this mode is that operators with access must have a valid SECRET security clearance and access approval for all categories for all information stored and/or processed on the system.
