Maintain an up-to-date, written, enforceable policy on financial conflicts of interest that complies with 45 CFR Part 94, inform each Investigator of the policy, the Investigator's reporting responsibilities regarding disclosure of significant financial interests, and the applicable regulation, and make such policy available via a publicly accessible Web site, or if none currently exist, available to any requestor within five business days of a request. A significant financial interest means a financial interest consisting of one or more of the following interests of the Investigator (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) that reasonably appears to be related to the Investigator's institutional responsibilities: 1. With regard to any publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any equity interest in the entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000. Included are payments and equity interests; 2. With regard to any non-publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or when the Investigator (or the Investigator's spouse or dependent children) holds any equity interest; or 3. Intellectual property rights and interests, upon receipt of income related to such rights and interest. Significant financial interests do not include the following: 1. Income from seminars, lectures, or teaching, and service on advisory or review panels for government agencies, Institutions of higher education, academic teaching hospitals, medical centers, or research institutes with an Institution of higher learning; and 2. Income from investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator does not directly control the investment decisions made in these vehicles.

b. Require each Investigator to complete training regarding the Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy prior to engaging in research related to any NIH-funded contract and at least every four years. The Institution must take reasonable steps [see Part 94.4(c)] to ensure that investigators working as collaborators, consultants or subcontractors comply with the regulations. c. Designate an official(s) to solicit and review disclosures of significant financial interests from each Investigator who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the NIH-funded research. d. Require that each Investigator who is planning to participate in the NIH-funded research disclose to the Institution's designated official(s) the Investigator's significant financial interest (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) no later than the date of submission of the Institution's proposal for NIHfunded research. Require that each Investigator who is participating in the NIH-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution during the period of the award as well as within thirty days of discovering or acquiring a new significant financial interest. - 32 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

e. Provide guidelines consistent with the regulations for the designated official(s) to determine whether an Investigator's significant financial interest is related to NIH-funded research and, if so related, whether the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest. An Investigator's significant financial interest is related to NIH-funded research when the Institution, thorough its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest: Could be affected by the NIH-funded research; or is in an entity whose financial interest could be affected by the research. A financial conflict of interest exists when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research. f. Take such actions as necessary to manage financial conflicts of interest, including any financial conflicts of a subcontractor Investigator. Management of an identified financial conflict of interest requires development and implementation of a management plan and, if necessary, a retrospective review and mitigation report pursuant to Part 94.5(a). g. Provide initial and ongoing FCIO reports to the Contracting Officer pursuant to Part 94.5(b). h. Maintain records relating to all Investigator disclosures of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosures, and all actions under the Institution's policy or retrospective review, if applicable, for at least 3 years from the date of final payment or, where applicable, for the other time periods specified in 48 CFR Part 4, subpart 4.7, Contract Records Retention. i. Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for employee sanctions or other administrative actions to ensure Investigator compliance as appropriate. j. Complete the certification in Section K - Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors titled "Certification of Institutional Policy on Financial Conflicts of Interest".

If the failure of an Institution to comply with an Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy or a financial conflict of interest management plan appears to have biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research, the Institution must promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the corrective action taken or to be taken. The Contracting Officer will consider the situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the NIHfunded research project. The Contracting Officer and/or HHS may inquire at any time before, during, or after award into any Investigator disclosure of financial interests, and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosure, regardless of whether the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interests.. The Contracting Officer may require submission of the records or review them on site. On the basis of this review of records or other information that may be available, the Contracting Officer may decide that a particular financial conflict of interest will bias the objectivity of the NIH-funded research to such an extent that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution has not managed the financial conflict of interest in accordance with Part 94.6(b). The issuance of a Stop Work Order by the Contracting Officer may be necessary until the matter is resolved. If the Contracting Officer determines that NIH-funded clinical research, whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment, has been designed, conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a financial conflict of interest that was managed or reported by the Institution, the shall require the Investigator involved to disclose the financial conflict of interest in each public presentation of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously published presentations.

L. 111-212), all information posted in FAPIIS on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews, will be publicly available. FAPIIS consists of two segments-1. The non-public segment, into which Government officials and the Contractor post information, which can only be viewed by-i. Government personnel and authorized users performing business on behalf of the Government; or ii. The Contractor, when viewing data on itself; and 2.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION a. INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION [FAR Provision 52.215-1 (January 2006)] a. Definitions.

"Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.

(i)Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data (e.g., commercial information, financial information, cost and pricing data); and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following statements, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted: "Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), data contained in the portions of this proposal which the offeror has specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that HHS may not be able to withhold a record (e.g. data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the HHS's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if HHS has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages ( insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)." (2) In addition, the offeror must mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may

- 47 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection; (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. (End of Provision)

Alternate I (October 1997).As prescribed in 15.209(a)(1), substitute the following paragraph (f)(4) for paragraph (f)(4) of the basic provision: (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals

- 48 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Alternate II (October 1997). As prescribed in 15.209(a)(2), add a paragraph (c)(9) substantially the same as the following to the basic clause: (9) Offerors may submit proposals that depart from stated requirements. Such proposals shall clearly identify why the acceptance of the proposal would be advantageous to the Government. Any deviations from the terms and conditions of the solicitation, as well as the comparative advantage to the Government, shall be clearly identified and explicitly defined. The Government reserves the right to amend the solicitation to allow all offerors an opportunity to submit revised proposals based on the revised requirements. b.

Use of the Metric System of Measurement It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to support the Federal transition to the metric system and to use the metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business related activities unless such use is impracticable or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies. The offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement. The following definitions are provided for your information: Hard Metric - - The replacement of a standard inch-pound size with an accepted metric size for a particular purpose. An example of size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart (as for soft drinks), or instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline). Soft Metric - The result of a mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents for a particular purpose. The physical characteristics are not changed. Dual Systems - The use of both inch-pound and metric systems. For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes. 9. Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) issued final modifications to the "Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information," the "Privacy Rule," on August 14, 2002. The Privacy Rule is a federal regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 that governs the protection of individually identifiable health information and is administered and enforced by the DHHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Those who must comply with the Privacy Rule (classified under the Rule as "covered entities" must do so by April 14, 2003 (with the exception of small health plans which have an extra year to comply. Decisions about the applicability and implementation of the Privacy Rule reside with the Contractor and his/her institution. The OCR Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/) provides information of the Privacy Rule, including a complete Regulation Text and a set of decision tools on "Am I a covered entity?" Information on the impact of the HIPAA Privacy Rule on NIH processes involving the review, award, and administration of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts can be found at: http:// grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-025.html. 10.

Selection of Offerors a. The acceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee. The committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation factors of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written critiques. The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror. b. The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a cost and price analysis, management analysis, etc. c. If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors. d. If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract 1. Communications will be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range.

TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS A detailed work plan must be submitted indicating how each aspect of the statement of work is to be accomplished. Your technical approach should be in as much detail as you consider necessary to fully explain your proposed technical approach or method. The technical proposal should reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being undertaken. The technical proposal must include information on how the project is to be organized, staffed, and managed. Information should be provided which will demonstrate your understanding and management of important events or tasks. Note to Offerors: Beginning May 25, 2008, the offeror shall include the applicable PubMed Central (PMC) or NIH Manuscript Submission reference number when citing publications that arise from its NIH funded research. 1. Technical Discussions The technical discussion included in the technical proposal should respond to the items set forth below: a. Statement of Work 1. Objectives State the overall objectives and the specific accomplishments you hope to achieve. Indicate the rationale for your plan, and relation to comparable work in progress elsewhere. Review pertinent work already published which is relevant to this project and your proposed approach. This should support the scope of the project as you perceive it. 2. Approach The offeror must submit an explanation of the proposed technical approach in conjunction with the tasks to be performed in achieving the project objectives. Proposals which merely restate the requirements of the Government's scope of work will not be eligible for award. Use as many subparagraphs, appropriately titled, as needed to clearly outline the general plan of work. Discuss phasing of research and, if appropriate, include experimental design and possible or probable outcome of approaches proposed. 3.

Schedule

- 66 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

Provide a schedule for completion of the work and delivery of items specified in the statement of work. Performance or delivery schedules shall be indicated for phases or segments of work, as applicable, by contract year as well as for the overall contract. Schedules shall be shown in terms of calendar months from the date of authorization to proceed or, where applicable, from the date of a stated event, as for example, receipt of a required approval by the Contracting Officer. Unless the request for proposal indicates that the stipulated schedules are mandatory, they shall be treated as desired or recommended schedules. In this event, proposals based upon the offeror's best alternative schedule, involving no overtime, extra shift or other premium, will be accepted for consideration. b. Personnel Describe the experience and qualifications of personnel who will be assigned for direct work on this program. Information is required which will show the composition of the task or work group, its general qualifications, and recent experience with similar equipment or programs. Special mention shall be made of direct technical supervisors and key technical personnel, and the approximate percentage of the total time each will be available for this program OFFERORS SHOULD ASSURE THAT THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, AND ALL OTHER PERSONNEL PROPOSED, SHALL NOT BE COMMITTED ON FEDERAL GRANTS AND CONTRACTS FOR MORE THAN A TOTAL OF 100% OF THEIR TIME. IF THE SITUATION ARISES WHERE IT IS DETERMINED THAT A PROPOSED EMPLOYEE IS COMMITTED FOR MORE THAN 100% OF HIS OR HER TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WILL REQUIRE ACTION ON THE PART OF THE OFFEROR TO CORRECT THE TIME COMMITMENT. 1. Single Principal Investigator/Project Director List the name of the Principal Investigator/Project Director responsible for overall implementation of the contract and key contact for technical aspects of the project. Even though there may be co-investigators, identify the Principal Investigator/Project Director who will be responsible for the overall implementation of any awarded contract. Discuss the qualifications, experience, and accomplishments of the Principal Investigator/Project Director. State the estimated time to be spent on the project, his/her proposed duties, and the areas or phases for which he/she will be responsible. 2. Multiple Principal Investigators The NIH now provides offerors the opportunity to propose a multiple Principal Investigator (PI) model on research and development contracts. The multiple PI model is intended to supplement, and not replace, the traditional single PI model. The NIH chose this RFP as a candidate for the multiple PI model. Ultimately, the decision to submit a proposal using the multiple PI versus single PI is the decision of the investigators and their institutions. The decision should be consistent with and justified by the scientific goals of the project. It is essential that organizations consider all aspects of this approach before submitting a proposal. While there are some projects that clearly are appropriate for the multiple PI model, the "fit" of other projects may not be so clear. Offerors should base the selection of either the single PI or multiple PI option on the research proposed, to ensure optimal facilitation of the science. Projects suitable for the multiple PI model could include as few as two PIs who are jointly responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the project. - 67 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

The multiple PI option is based on the proposed project, not on the number of performance sites or the number of participating institutions. Multiple PIs under research contracts shall use the Subcontract Model. In this approach, offerors submit a single proposal, and a single award is made to the prime contractor. The prime contractor, when appropriate, will award subcontracts to fund the components of the project at the other institutions. The relationship between the contractor and subcontractors must be designed to support all components of the project. To facilitate communication with the NIH, the offeror must designate a Contact PI at the time of proposal submission. The Contact PI must be employed at the prime contractor's organization. The designation of the Contact PI may rotate on an annual basis. However, this rotation is restricted to PIs located at the prime contractor's organization. The Contact PI is responsible for: relaying communications between all of the PIs and the NIH, and coordinating progress reports for the project. Being named Contact PI does not confer any special authority for the project. Leadership Plan Offerors proposing multiple PIs will need to submit a Leadership Plan as part of the Technical Proposal. The Leadership Plan shall describe the governance and organizational structure of the research project including communication plans, process for making decisions on scientific direction, allocation of resources, publications, intellectual property issues, and procedures for resolving conflicts. The Leadership Plan shall follow the Table of Contents provided below:

I. Rationale Include a discussion of how the project will be enhanced by the multiple PI approach. II. Identification of all proposed PIs Identify the proposed PIs, their point of contact information and affiliated organizations, and the percentages of time proposed for this project. Identify the Contact PI and plans for rotation of that role, if any. III. Roles and Responsibilities Identify both the scientific and administrative roles and responsibilities of all named PIs. IV. Approach to Fiscal and Management Coordination Describe how the project will be performed and monitored from a fiscal and management perspective. Discuss organizational administrative coordination and support. V. Project Direction and Resource Allocation Address how decisions will be made regarding scientific direction, and, how resources will be allocated and redistributed if needed during performance. Address plans for shared resources such as IT or other shared data considerations. If joint standard operating procedures will be developed, describe this process. VI. Communication and Lines of Authority Address communication and lines of authority within and among PIs and within and among organizations. VII. Data sharing, Intellectual Property, Publication, and other Proprietary Considerations - 68 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

Data sharing plans, intellectual property considerations, publication agreements, and any other proprietary or confidential information sharing should be addressed in this section. VIII. Conflict Resolution Address how conflicts will be avoided, identified, and resolved. IX. Other Address any other information relative to the leadership approach to Multiple PI projects. Offerors submitting single PI proposals do not need to submit a Leadership Plan. 3. Other Investigators List all other investigators/professional personnel who will be participating in the project. Discuss the qualifications, experience, and accomplishments. State the estimated time each will spend on the project, proposed duties on the project, and the areas or phases for which each will be responsible. 4. Additional Personnel List names, titles, and proposed duties of additional personnel, if any, who will be required for full-time employment, or on a subcontract or consultant basis. The technical areas, character, and extent of subcontract or consultant activity will be indicated and the anticipated sources will be specified and qualified. For all proposed personnel who are not currently members of the offeror's staff, a letter of commitment or other evidence of availability is required. A resume does not meet this requirement. Commitment letters for use of consultants and other personnel to be hired must include: ˇ The specific items or expertise they will provide. ˇ Their availability to the project and the amount of time anticipated. ˇ Willingness to act as a consultant. ˇ How rights to publications and patents will be handled. 5. Resumes Resumes of all key personnel are required. Each must indicate educational background, recent experience, specific or technical accomplishments, and a listing of relevant publications. 2. Other Considerations Record and discuss specific factors not included elsewhere which support your proposal. Using specifically titled subparagraphs, items may include: a. Any agreements and/or arrangements with subcontractor(s). Provide as much detail as necessary to explain how the statement of work will be accomplished within this working relationship. b. Unique arrangements, equipment, etc., which none or very few organizations are likely to have which is advantageous for effective implementation of this project.

c. Equipment and unusual operating procedures established to protect personnel from hazards associated with this project. d. Other factors you feel are important and support your proposed research. e. Recommendations for changing reporting requirements if such changes would be more compatible with the offeror's proposed schedules. 3. Technical Evaluation Proposals will be technically evaluated in accordance with SECTION M - Evaluation Factors for Award of this solicitation. 4. Human Subjects IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following subparagraphs shall be addressed, as applicable, in a SEPARATE SECTION of the Technical Proposal entitled, "HUMAN SUBJECTS." a. Notice to Offerors of Requirements of 45 CFR Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects, HHSAR 352.270-4(a) (January 2006) a. Copies of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR Part 46, are available from the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individuals who participate as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by the HHS. b. The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects. The use of autopsy materials is governed by applicable State and local law and is not directly regulated by 45 CFR Part 46. c. Activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1-6) are exempt from coverage. d. Inappropriate designations of the noninvolvement of human subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in delays in the review of a proposal. The Government's Project Officer will make a final determination of whether the proposed activities are covered by the regulations or are in an exempt category, based on the information provided in the proposal. In doubtful cases, the Project Officer will consult with OHRP. e. In accordance with 45 CFR Part 46, prospective Contractors being considered for award shall be required to file with OHRP an acceptable Assurance of Compliance with the regulations, specifying review procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human subjects. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an institutional review board shall assure that: the rights and welfare of the human subjects involved are adequately protected; the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to both the potential benefits, if any, to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained; and informed consent will be obtained by methods that are adequate and appropriate. HHS regulations for the protection of human subjects (45 CFR Part 46), information regarding OHRP registration and - 70 -

This policy announcement is found in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Announcement dated June 5, 2000 at the following website: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/ guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html. Offerors should review the policy announcement prior to submission of their offers. The following is a summary of the Policy Announcement:

- 72 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

For any solicitation for research involving human subjects, the offeror shall provide in its technical proposal the following information: (1) a list of the names of the principal investigator and any other individuals proposed under the contract who are responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research; (2) the title of the education program completed (or to be completed prior to the award of the contract) for each named personnel; (3) a one sentence description of the program(s) listed in (2) above. This requirement extends to investigators and all individuals responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research who are working as subcontractors or consultants under the contract. Curricula that are readily available and meet the educational requirement include the NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) on-line tutorial, entitled "Protecting Human Research Participants" at: http://phrp.nihtraining.com. This course is also available in Spanish under the title "Protección de los participantes humanos de la investigación" at: http:// pphi.nihtraining.com. You may take the tutorials on-line or download the information in PDF form at no cost. The University of Rochester has made its training program available for individual investigators. Completion of this program will also satisfy the educational requirement. The University of Rochester manual can be obtained through Centerwatch, Inc. at http://store.centerwatch.com/p-51-protecting-study-volunteers-in-research-3rdedition.aspx. If an institution already has developed educational programs on the protection of research participants, completion of these programs also will satisfy the educational requirement. In addition, prior to the substitution of the principal investigator or any other individuals responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research under the contract, the Contractor shall provide the contracting officer with the title of the education program and a one sentence description of the program that the replacement has completed. d. Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that women and members of minority groups and their sub-populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research projects involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the relevant Institute/Center Director that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. The Director, NIH, may determine that exclusion under other circumstances is acceptable, upon the recommendation of an Institute/Center Director, based on a compelling rationale and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources. Women of childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43), and applies to research subjects of all ages. All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the UPDATED "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research, Amended October 2001," published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001 at the following web site: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm These guidelines contain a definition of clinical research adopted in June 2001, as: "(1) Patient-oriented research. Research conducted with human subjects (or on material of human origin such as tissues, specimens and cognitive phenomena) for which an investigator (or colleague) directly interacts with human subjects. Excluded from this definition are in vitro studies that utilize human tissues that cannot be linked to a living individual. Patient-oriented research includes (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) therapeutic interventions, (c) clinical trials, and (d) development of new technologies; (2)

Epidemiologic and behavioral studies; and (3) Outcomes research and health services research." Information Required for ALL Clinical Research Proposals This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the offeror's plans for inclusion of women and minorities in the research proposed; or (2) the offeror's justification(s) for exclusion of one or both groups from the research proposed. Provide information on the composition of the proposed study population in terms of sex/ gender and racial/ethnic groups and provide a rationale for selection of such subjects in response to the requirements of the solicitation. The description may include (but is not limited to) information on the population characteristics of the disease or condition being studied in the planned research, and/or described in the statement of work, national and local demography, knowledge of the racial/ethnic/cultural characteristics of the population, prior experience and collaborations in recruitment and retention of the populations and subpopulations to be studied, and the plans, arrangements and letters of commitment from relevant community groups and organizations for the planned research. The proposal must include the following information:

ˇ A description of the subject selection criteria ˇ The proposed dates of enrollment (beginning and end) ˇ A description of the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as subjects ˇ A compelling rationale for proposed exclusion of any sex/gender or racial/ethnic group ˇ The proposed sample composition using the "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table"(see Section J, Attachments) NOTE 1: For all proposals, use the ethnic and racial categories and complete the "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive No. 15, which may be found at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ fedreg_notice_15. NOTE 2: If this is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) or Requirements contract as defined in FAR 16.5, the proposal should describe in general terms how it will comply with each bulleted item above for each task order. When the Government issues a task order request for proposal, each of the bulleted information items must be fully and specifically addressed in the proposal. Standards for Collecting Data. When you, as a contractor, are planning data collection items on race and ethnicity, you shall use, at a minimum, the categories identified in OMB Directive No. 15. The collection of greater detail is encouraged. However, you should design any additional, more detailed items so that they can be aggregated into these required categories. Self-reporting or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. When you collect race and ethnicity separately, you must collect ethnicity first. You shall offer respondents the option of selecting one or more racial designations. When you collect data on race and ethnicity separately, you shall also make provisions to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. When you present aggregate data, you shall provide the number of respondents who selected only one category, for each of the five racial categories. If you collapse data on multiple responses, you shall make available, at a minimum, the total number of respondents reporting "more than one race." Federal

agencies shall not present data on detailed categories if doing so would compromise data quality or confidentiality standards. In addition to the above requirements, solicitations for NIH defined Phase III clinical trials * require that: a) all proposals and/or protocols provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm, Definitions - Significant Difference). *The definition of an " NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trial" can also be found at this website.) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable; and b) all contractors to report annually cumulative subject accrual, and progress in conducting analyses for sex/gender and race/ethnicity differences. Offerors may obtain copies of the Updated Guidelines from the sources above or from the contact person listed in the solicitation. Also, the proposal must include one of the following plans: ˇ Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Use the form entitled, "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table," when preparing your response to the solicitation requirements for inclusion of women and minorities. (See Section J-List of Documents, Exhibits and Other Attachments of the RFP) Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, the Government has determined that the work required by this solicitation does not involve a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. Therefore, the NIH believes that the inclusion of women and minority populations is appropriate for this project. (See Section M of this RFP for more information about evaluation factors for award.) Use the form entitled, "Inclusion Enrollment Report," for reporting in the resultant contract. e. Inclusion of Children in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that children (defined below) must be included in all human subjects research, including, but not limited to, clinical trials, conducted under a contract funded by the NIH, unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. (See examples of Justifications for Exclusion of Children below). For the purposes of this policy, contracts involving human subjects include categories that would otherwise be exempt - 75 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

from the DHHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (sections 101(b) and 401(b) of 45 CFR 46), such as surveys, evaluation of educational interventions, and studies of existing data or specimens that should include children as participants. This policy applies to both domestic and foreign research contracts. For purposes of this policy, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. All offerors proposing research involving human subjects should read the "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research Involving Human Subjects" which was published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on March 6, 1998 and is available at the following URL address: http://www.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-024.html Offerors also may obtain copies from the contact person listed in the RFP. Inclusion of children as participants in research must be in compliance with all applicable subparts of 45 CFR 46 as well as other pertinent laws and regulations whether or not such research is otherwise exempted from 45 CFR 46. Therefore, any proposals must include a description of plans for including children, unless the offeror presents clear and convincing justification for an exclusion. The "Human Subjects" section of your technical proposal should provide either a description of the plans to include children and a rationale for selecting or excluding a specific age range of child, or an explanation of the reason(s) for excluding children as participants in the research. This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the plans for including children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research; and/or (2) the justification of exclusion of children or exclusion of a specific age range of children. When children are included, the plan also must include a description of: (1) the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included; (2) the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children; and, (3) the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Justifications for Exclusion of Children It is expected that children will be included in all research involving human subjects unless one or more of the following exclusionary circumstances can be fully justified: ˇ The objective of the solicitation is not relevant to children.
o

There are laws or regulations barring the inclusion of children in the research to be conducted under the solicitation. The knowledge being sought in the research is already available for children or will be obtained from another ongoing study, and an additional study will be redundant. You should provide documentation of other studies justifying the exclusion. A separate, age-specific study in children is warranted and preferable. Examples include: - The relative rarity of the condition in children, as compared with adults (in that extraordinary effort would be needed to include children); or - The number of children is limited because the majority are already accessed by a nationwide pediatric disease research network; or - Issues of study design preclude direct applicability of hypotheses and/ or interventions to both adults and children (including different cognitive, developmental, or disease stages of different age-related metabolic processes); or - 76 -

- Insufficient data are available in adults to judge potential risk in children (in which case one of the research objectives could be to obtain sufficient adult data to make this judgment). While children usually should not be the initial group to be involved in research studies, in some instances, the nature and seriousness of the illness may warrant their participation earlier based on careful risk and benefit analysis; or - Study designs aimed at collecting additional data on pre-enrolled adult study subjects (e.g., longitudinal follow-up studies that did not include data on children); - Other special cases justified by the offeror and found acceptable to the review group and the Institute Director Definition of a Child For the purpose of this solicitation, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. The definition of child described above will pertain to this solicitation (notwithstanding the FDA definition of a child as an individual from infancy to 16 years of age, and varying definitions employed by some states). Generally, State laws define what constitutes a "child," and such definitions dictate whether or not a person can legally consent to participate in a research study. However, State laws vary, and many do not address when a child can consent to participate in research. Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46, subpart D, Sec.401-409) address DHHS protections for children who participate in research, and rely on State definitions of "child" for consent purposes. Consequently, the children included in this policy (persons under the age of 21) may differ in the age at which their own consent is required and sufficient to participate in research under State law. For example, some states consider a person age 18 to be an adult and therefore one who can provide consent without parental permission. Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects a. HHS Regulations at 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart C provide additional protections pertaining to biomedical and behavioral research involving prisoners or those individuals who, during the period of the contract become prisoners, as subjects. These regulations also set forth the duties of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) where prisoners are involved in the research. HHS funded research involving prisoners as subjects may not proceed until the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) issues approval, in writing, as required by 45 CFR 46.306(a)(2). In addition, OHRP Guidance on the Involvement of Prisoners in Research may be found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/prisoner.pdf. b. HHS Waiver for Epidemiological Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects On June 20, 2003 the Secretary of HHS waived the applicability of certain provisions of Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 46, (Additional DHHS Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects) to specific types of epidemiological research involving prisoners as subjects. The applicability of 45 CFR 46.305(a)(1) and 46.306(a)(2) for certain epidemiological research conducted or funded by DHHS is waived when: 1. The sole purposes are: a. to describe the prevalence or incidence of a disease by identifying all cases, or - 77 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

b. to study potential risk factor associations for a disease, and 2. The Institution responsible for the conduct of the research certifies to the OHRP that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the research and fulfilled its duties under 45 CFR 46.305(a)(2 7) and determined and documented that: a. the research presents no more than minimal risk, and b. no more than inconvenience to the prisoner subjects, and c. prisoners are not a particular focus of the research. For more information about this Waiver see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/special/ prisoners/Prisoner waiver 6-20-03.pdf f. Research Involving Human Fetal Tissue Human Fetal Tissue means tissue or cells obtained from a dead human fetus, including human embryonic stem cells, human pluripotent stem cells and human embryonic germ cells. The governing federal statute is the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g 1 and 289g 2. Implementing regulations and guidance for conducting research on human fetal tissue may be found at 45 CFR 46, Subpart B and http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/ not93-235.html and any subsequent revisions to this NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts ("Guide") Notice. By signing the face page of the proposal, the offeror (authorized institutional official) certifies that researchers using human fetal tissue are in compliance with 42 USC 289g 2. This statute specifically prohibits any person from knowingly acquiring, receiving, or transferring any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. "Valuable consideration" is a concept similar to profit, and does not include reasonable payment for costs associated with the collection processing, preservation, storage, quality control or transportation of these tissues. Research involving the transplantation of human fetal tissue must be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local law. 5. Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, Section 508 Compliance is applicable to this solicitation and the following information is provided to assist in proposal preparation. IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following information shall be addressed in a separate section of the Technical Proposal, entitled, "Section 508 Compliance." Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, HHSAR 352.239-73(a) (January 2010) a. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit-i. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and ii. Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access

- 78 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. b. Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotations/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 visions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/ standards.htm. c. The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Evaluation Template may be found on the HHS Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/contracting/ technology/vendors.html). d. Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government -- i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense. (End of provision) The "HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template" is included in SECTION J - List of Attachments, of this solicitation. c. BUSINESS PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS 1. Basic Cost/Price Information The business proposal must contain sufficient information to allow the Government to perform a basic analysis of the proposed cost or price of the work. This information shall include the amounts of the basic elements of the proposed cost or price.

Salary Rate Limitation in Fiscal Year 2013 Offerors are advised that pursuant to P.L. **, no NIH Fiscal Year 2013 (October 1, 2012 - September 30, 2013) funds may be used to pay the direct annual salary of an individual through any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation at a rate in excess of the Executive Schedule, Level II* (direct - 82 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

salary is exclusive of Overhead, Fringe Benefits and General and Administrative expenses, also referred to as "indirect cost" or "facilities and administrative (F&A) costs"). Direct salary has the same meaning as the term "institutional base salary." An individual's direct salary (or institutional base salary) is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care or other activities. Direct salary (or institutional base salary) excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. This does not preclude the offeror from absorbing that portion of an employee's annual salary (plus the dollar amount for fringe benefits and associated indirect costs) that exceeds a rate of the Executive Schedule, Level II*. The salary rate limitation set by P.L ** applies only to Fiscal Year 2013 funds, however, salary rate ceilings for subsequent years may be included in future DHHS appropriation acts. Multi-year contracts awarded pursuant to this solicitation may be subject to unilateral modifications by the Government if an individual's annual salary exceeds any salary rate ceiling established in future appropriations acts. The Executive Schedule, Level II* annual salary rate limitation also applies to individuals proposed under subcontracts, however it does not apply to consultants. P.L .** states: "None of the funds appropriated in this title shall be used to pay the salary of an individual through a grant or other extramural mechanism, at a rate in excess of Executive Level II." LINK TO EXECUTIVE SCHEDULE RATES OF PAY: http://www.opm.gov/oca/ (For current year rates, click on Salaries and Wages/Executive Schedule/Rates of Pay for the Executive Schedule. For prior year rates, click on Salaries and Wages/select Another Year at the top of the page/Executive Schedule/Rates of Pay for the Executive Schedule. Rates are effective January 1 of each calendar year unless otherwise noted.) *Note to Offerors: The current Fiscal Year Executive Level II Salary Rate shall be adhered to in the preparation of your proposal. All costs associated with any resultant contract award shall be in compliance with the current Fiscal Year Executive Level II Salary rates. ** Pending passage of legislation. 6.

THIS PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. b. The term "subcontract" means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime Contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements/purchase orders for supplies and services such as equipment purchase, copying services, and travel services. c. The offeror understands that: 1. No contract will be awarded unless and until an acceptable plan is negotiated with the Contracting Officer which plan will be incorporated into the contract, as a material part thereof. 2.

The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed. 4. Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract. 5. It is the offeror's responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to Small Business Concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, Women-Owned Small Business Concerns, HUBZone Small Business Concerns, Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns that each such aspect of the offeror's plan will be judged independent of the other. 6.

The name of the individual employed by the offeror who will administer the offeror's subcontracting program and a description of his/her duties. 8. A description of the efforts the offeror will make to assure that Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses have an equitable chance to compete for subcontracts. 9.

Large business prime contractors serving as mentors in the HHS Mentor-Protégé program are eligible for HHS subcontracting plan credit, and shall submit a copy of their HHS Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU)-approved mentor protégé agreements as part of their offers. The amount of credit provided by the Contracting Officer to a mentor firm for protégé firm developmental assistance costs shall be calculated on a dollar for dollar basis and reported by the mentor firm in the Summary Subcontract Report via the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) at http://www.esrs.gov. The mentor firm and protégé firm shall submit to the Contracting Officer a signed joint statement agreeing on the dollar value of the developmental assistance the mentor firm provided. (For example, a mentor firm would report a $10,000 subcontract awarded to a protégé firm and provision of $5,000 of developmental assistance as $15,000 of developmental assistance.) The mentor firm may use this additional credit towards attaining its subcontracting plan participation goal under this contract. b. The program consists of-i. Mentor firms--large businesses that: (i) demonstrate the interest, commitment, and capability to provide developmental assistance to small business protégé firms; and (ii) have a Mentor-Protégé agreement approved by HHS' OSDBU; ii.

Qualified HUBZone firms are identified in the Small Business Administration website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone. 9. Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.304(c)(4), the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns in performance of the contract in the authorized NAICS Industry Subsectors shall be evaluated in unrestricted competitive acquisitions expected to exceed $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) subject to certain limitations (see FAR 19.1202-1 and 19.1202-2(b). The dollar amounts cited above include any option years/option quantities that may be included in this solicitation. The definition of a "small disadvantaged business" is cited in FAR 19.001. The factor entitled "Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation" as set forth in Section M Evaluation Factors for Award shall be used for evaluation purposes. The Department of Commerce determines, on an annual basis, by Subsectors, as contained in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and region, if any, the authorized SDB procurement mechanisms and applicable factors (percentages). The NAICS codes can be found at: http://www.sba.gov/size The Department of Commerce website for the annual determination for NAICS codes* is: http://www.acquisition.gov/References/sdbadjustments.htm. * Note: Public Law 103-355 which authorized the SDB Price Evaluation Adjustment (PEA) and associated percentages/factors expired on December 9, 2004, therefore, the percentages shown at this website are no longer applicable. Offerors shall include with their offers, SDB targets, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract value, in each of the applicable, authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s). The applicable authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s) for this project is (are) identified elsewhere in this RFP. A total target for SDB participation by the Prime Contractor, that includes any joint ventures and team members, shall be provided as well as a total target for SDB participation by subcontractors. In addition, offerors must provide information that describes their plans for meeting the targets set forth in their proposal. This information shall be provided in one clearly marked section of the Business Proposal, which shall describe the extent of participation of SDB concerns in the performance of the contract. If the evaluation factor in this solicitation includes an SDB evaluation factor or subfactor that considers the extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified, the SDB concerns considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any resultant contract. Offerors should note that addressing the extent of small disadvantaged business participation is not in any way intended to be a substitute for submission of the subcontracting plan, if it is required by this solicitation. An example of the type of information that might be given (in addition to the narrative describing the plan for meeting the targets) follows: EXAMPLE Targets for SDB Participation - NAICS Industry Subsector 223

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
1. GENERAL Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against four factors. The factors in order of importance are: technical, cost, past performance and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) participation. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, past performance, cost/price and SDB participation are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the SOLICITATION. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the SOLICITATION. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below. 2. COST/PRICE EVALUATION Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. [Cost Realism: The specific elements of each offeror(s) proposed costs are realistic when the proposed cost elements are evaluated and found to: 1) be realistic for the work to be performed; 2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and 3) be consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror(s) technical proposal. Cost Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost to perform the contract in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.]

3. HUMAN SUBJECT EVALUATION This research project involves human subjects. NIH Policy requires: a. Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks The offeror's proposal must address the involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation, or provide sufficient information on the research subjects to allow a determination by NICHD that a designated exemption is appropriate. If you claim that this research should be considered exempt from coverage by the Federal Regulations at 45 CFR 46, the proposal should address why you believe it is exempt, and under which exemption it applies. The reviewers will evaluate the proposal with regard to four issues: Risks to Human Subjects, Adequacy of Protection Against Risks, Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others, and Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained. See Section L for a complete discussion of what is required to be addressed for each of these issues. Based on the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., concerns are identified as to the - 92 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

protections described against risk to human subjects or no discussion is found regarding protections against risk to human subjects) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the protection of human subjects from research risks is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. b. Women and Minorities Women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be included in the study population of research involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification are provided indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. In addition, for NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trials, all proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/ women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm , Definitions - Significant Difference) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable, unless the Government has specified that this solicitation involves a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. The proposal also must include one of the following plans:

ˇ Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups (representation of sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups as subject selection criterion is not required; however, inclusion and analyses are encouraged), OR ˇ Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Also, the proposal must address the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as participants. Reviewers will consider the areas covered here and in Section L of the solicitation in narrative form in their evaluation. Some of the issues they will evaluate include: ˇ whether the plan proposed includes minorities and both genders in adequate representation ˇ how the offeror addresses the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in the development of a proposal that is appropriate to the scientific objectives of the solicitation ˇ the description of the proposed study populations in terms of sex/gender and racial/ethnic groups and the rationale for selection of such subjects

- 93 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

ˇ if exclusion is proposed, that the rationale is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or to the purpose of the research. ˇ In addition, for gender exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if it is because:
o

the purpose of the research constrains the offeror's selection of study participants by gender (e.g., uniquely valuable stored specimens or existing datasets are single gender; very small numbers of subjects are involved; or overriding factors dictate selection of subjects); or gender representation of specimens or existing datasets cannot be accurately determined, and this does not compromise the scientific objectives of the research.

o o

ˇ For minority group exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if those minority groups are excluded because:
o o

inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to their health; or inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research.

ˇ For NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials, reviewers will also consider whether there is an adequate description of plans to conduct analyses to detect significant differences of clinical or public health importance in intervention effect(s) by sex/gender and/or racial ethnic subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is expected in the primary analyses, or if there is an adequate description of plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is not expected in the primary analyses. If you determine that inclusion of women and minority populations is not feasible, you must submit a detailed rationale and justification for exclusion of one or both groups from the study population with the technical proposal. The Government will review the rationale to determine if it is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or the purpose of the research Based on the evaluation of the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed gender/minority inclusion plans, or concerns are identified as to the gender or minority representation, or the proposal does not adequately address limited representation of one gender or minority; or the plan is not in accordance with NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of women/minorities inclusion. If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion/ exclusion of women and minorities is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. c. Children Children (i.e. individuals under the age of 21) must be included in all human subject research unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. Your proposal must include a description of plans for including children. If you plan to exclude children from the required research, your proposal must present an acceptable justification for the exclusion. If you determine that exclusion of a specific age range of child is appropriate, your

- 94 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

proposal must also address the rationale for such exclusion. Also, the plan must include a description of the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included, of the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children, and the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Also, see Section L of the solicitation for further specific requirements on inclusion of children. Based on the reviewers' evaluation of the offeror's response, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed inclusion plans for children; or concerns are identified as to the offeror's response regarding the inclusion of children; or the plan is not in accordance wit h NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion of children is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. 4. EVALUATION OF OPTIONS It is anticipated that any contract(s) awarded from this solicitation will contain option provision(s) and period(s). In accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, (July 1990), the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 5. EVALUATION OF DATA SHARING PLAN The offeror's plan for the sharing of final research data shall be assessed for appropriateness and adequacy. If your proposal does not include a plan or if the plan in your proposal is considered "unacceptable," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify your data sharing plan during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your data sharing plan is still considered "unacceptable" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. 6. TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS The evaluation factors are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing the technical proposals. The factors below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes. Subfactors are listed in order of relative importance.

Demonstrated ability to recruit the target sample size in the required time frame despite potential competing studies. Demonstrated ability to recruit women early in the first trimester. b. Demonstrated capability and experience in the conduct of observational research in pregnant women.

7. EVALUATION OF ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY - SECTION 508 The offeror's proposal must demonstrate compliance with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194 for all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports. If your proposal does not include a completed HHS "Section 508 Product Assessment Template" (hereafter referred to as the "Template") which demonstrates that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, or, if the completed "Template" included in your proposal is considered "noncompliant," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify the "Template" during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your "Template" is still considered "noncompliant" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. 8. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR

- 96 -

RFP Number : NIH-NICHD-DESPR-2013-17-1

Offeror's past performance information will be evaluated subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. 9. EXTENT OF SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION SDB participation will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall commitment and realism of the offeror's SDB Participation targets will be used in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered to offer the best value to the Government. The extent of the offeror's Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Targets will be evaluated before determination of the competitive range. Evaluation of SDB participation will be assessed based on consideration of the information presented in the offeror's proposal. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform. Offers will be evaluated on the following sub-factors: a. Extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified b. Extent of commitment to use SDB concerns c. Complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform d. Realism of the proposal e. Past performance of offerors in complying with subcontracting plan goals for SDB concerns and monetary targets for SDB participation f. Extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition.

Background and Statement of Work Diet, Obesity, and Weight Change in Pregnancy Background The rising prevalence of obesity in the U.S. over the past several decades and the accompanying spread of adverse long-ranging health effects pose serious public health and economic consequences. While a genetic contribution to obesity is well-established, genetic factors underlying individual susceptibility to common obesity have modest effects, which can be amplified considerably in the presence of certain triggering environmental factors. Approximately two-thirds of women of reproductive age now enter pregnancy at a high body mass index, and the majority of women experience pregnancy-associated weight gains in excess of Institute of Medicine guidelines, leading to increased perinatal and chronic health risks for both mother and child. The increased prevalence of obesity among women of reproductive age is reflected in a concomitant increase in the prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM), which confers additional increased risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Limited previous intervention research has indicated modest improvement in short-term maternal diet and gestational weight gain, with little evidence of long-term adherence. The well-documented inadequacies of these and traditional weight-loss interventions relying on existing health behavior paradigms suggest the need for innovations that allow for a shift in the theoretical framework underlying the determinants of eating behavior. Recent findings from basic research in neuroscience suggest that the brain reward response to highly palatable foods is a critical element that is currently absent in current theoretical frameworks. Individuals vary with respect to their "food reward responsivity", which refers to susceptibility to the effects of food and eating on the brain reward system. Simultaneously, foods vary with respect to their "reinforcement value", which refers to the degree to which foods activate the brain reward system. Whereas certain foods elicit a normative food reward response that is sensitive to homeostatic regulation of appetite, it is hypothesized that "hyperpalatable" foods, which elicit exceptionally pronounced activation of the brain reward system, may blunt this sensitivity, leading to hedonic, non-homeostatic overeating characterized by food intake beyond energetic needs. Repeated consumption of hyperpalatable foods reinforces the brain food reward response and culminates in neurological changes similar to those observed with drugs of abuse. However, this quickly-expanding body of work has not yet been incorporated into population-based research. Research to date on food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value has been conducted primarily in small samples in the general population. However, to date, no studies have examined these constructs among pregnant women. While it is known that most women gain more weight than recommended and many do not return to their pre-pregnancy weight, there is insufficient data on individual determinants of dietary intake and weight change during and after pregnancy. Understanding the association of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value with dietary intake and weight change during pregnancy and postpartum may be informative for the development of clinical and public health interventions that promote optimal diet and weight in this population. Objectives and Design DESPR is examining the implications of findings on the importance of the neurological food reward response for understanding and influencing maternal diet and weight change. This prospective observational study will provide in-depth information regarding the associations of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value with dietary intake, weight change, and body composition change during pregnancy and postpartum. Specifically, the study will: 1. Examine the role of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value in dietary intake, weight change, and body composition change during pregnancy and postpartum. 2. Examine associations among food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value, eating behaviors, and the personal food environment.

3. Examine the role of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value in understanding the link between genetic variants associated with obesity and pregnancy weight/body composition outcomes 4. Examine the role of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value, food preferences, and maternal intake of hyperpalatable foods on the introduction of foods into the infant's diet. 5. Investigate the behavioral phenotype of food reward responsivity. The offeror will recruit 345 pregnant normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI 30 kg/m2) women (115 women from each weight class) during early first trimester and follow through one year postpartum. The study will include serial collection of quantitative data from multiple sources including dietary assessment, self-administered questionnaires, biomedical, and anthropometric assessment. Embedded substudies will include qualitative data on perceptions regarding the reinforcing value of food and impact on dietary intake and a laboratory-based behavioral experiment investigating the relationship of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value with overeating. Participants will be recruited during the first trimester of pregnancy (up to 12 weeks gestation) from an obstetrics/gynecology clinic within the United States. Women from all racial and ethnic backgrounds will be enrolled. Eligibility will be restricted to non-smoking women age 18 years with no illicit drug, alcohol, or substance abuse; no major chronic illness (other than well-managed hypertension) or psychiatric disorder; and no current or previous history of eating disorders. Eligible women who provide written informed consent will provide baseline assessment of reproductive history, sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometrics, biologic specimens, taste sensitivity, and measures of eating and health behaviors. Participants will be subsequently assessed at 16-22 and 28-32 weeks gestation, as well as at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum. Maternal fasting blood, urine and stool samples, placenta, cord blood, and child hair will be obtained and shipped to the NICHD bio-repository for analyses including but not limited to fasting glucose, insulin, lipid profile, C-Reactive Protein, interleukin-6, TNF-, adiponectin, carotenoids, and genetic data. Dietary intake will be assessed using three 24-hour diet recalls at each assessment point collected online using the ASA-24. Additionally, a food frequency questionnaire will be administered at baseline, and an infant food frequency checklist will be administered at 6 months and 1 year postpartum. The schedule of assessments is summarized in Table 1. Table 1.

A subsample of 50 women will be recruited to participate in the nested behavioral experiment. This substudy will utilize the Eating in the Absence of Hunger (EAH) research protocol, which involves administering a preload to produce satiety followed by offering additional foods for ad libitum intake. All foods provided will be weighed before and after intake to assess compliance with study protocol and to measure ad libitum intake. Nutritional characteristics of the additional foods offered for ad libitum intake will be experimentally manipulated, and may include fat/sugar/sodium content, degree of food processing, food category, and others.

Primary outcome measures will include total amount of the test foods consumed (energy intake, mass and volume of intake) during EAH. All subjects will undergo all study conditions in randomized order on separate days. All procedures will be conducted at the same time of day for all subjects, and require that subjects have fasted for the previous 4 hours. Eight to ten focus groups will be conducted with a subsample of approximately 80 women (8-12 participants per focus group) to obtain qualitative data addressing perceptions of diet during pregnancy, food reward value, and influences on eating behaviors. Study participants will receive remuneration of $400 for completion of all study visits. Those participating in either substudy will receive an additional $50.
