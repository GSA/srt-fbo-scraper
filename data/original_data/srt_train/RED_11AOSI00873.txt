1 ORGANIZATION

This effort will affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Office of Strategic Intelligence and Information (OSII)
Directorate. The primary customer will be the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), Technical Exploitation Unit (TEXU).

1.1 BUSINESS BACKGROUND

ATF is a unique law enforcement agency under the auspices of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). It is charged with the
responsibility to regulate the industries and investigate violations of Federal laws pertaining to alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, to
include certain acts of arson. ATF strives to protect communities from violent criminals, disrupt criminal enterprises and stop terrorism
through partnerships with the public, industries, other Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.

An example of the commitment in fulfilling its mission, ATF has taken-up and continues to play a critical role in combating terrorism. The ATF
OSII Directorate is a major partner in TEDAC. Authorized by the Executive and Legislative Branches, TEDAC is instituted and identified as the
primary interagency for collection and management of intelligence and information relating to Improvise Explosive Devices (IEDs) of U.S.
interest worldwide. Its function is to support law enforcement and military efforts in defeating IEDs and combat terrorism.

TEXU is primarily responsible for the analysis, reverse engineering and documentation of electronic devices used as IED initiation systems. The
information gathered is used to build profiles of bomb designers and bomb makers by collecting signatures and electronic data. The unit also
conducts research and development for streamlining device correlations. The technical reports generated by TEXU are disseminated for use by the
intelligence community, the military and law enforcement agencies. The work performed by TEXU is vital to National Security.
