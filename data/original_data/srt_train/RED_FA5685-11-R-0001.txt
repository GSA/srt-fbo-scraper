EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD (1) This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly less important than 2, cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. Evaluation for this source selection will be in accordance with FAR part 12 and 13 with the following factors: Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 ­ Technical Proposal Price Proposal Past Performance

(2) An offeror will be determined technically acceptable if no exception is taken to the Statement of Work (SOW), the requirements of the RFP, and the qualifications listed below. The offeror shall submit a statement to that effect. Omission of this statement may result in a determination of technical unacceptability. FACTOR 1 ­ Technical Proposal (a) In order to be considered for award, the offeror's technica l proposal must be rated in all factors as acceptable. To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must provide all information and/or requirements listed below. Offeror must demonstrate the following qualifications:

FA5685-11-R-0001 Page 18 of 30 (i) Must have obtained all licenses and required documentation to perform as an Internet Service Provider in Turkey. The Standard is met when the applicant provides a copy of the required licenses and documentation. (ii) Must provide documentation describing the uplink with TurkTelekom. The Standard is met when the offeror describes the stated uplink so that it can be determined that is a viable solution by the technical evaluation team. (iii) Must provide documentation demonstrating an agreement with TurkTelekom for the stated uplink. The Standard is met by when the applicant provides a copy of the agreement that establishes the parameters necessary for the proposed uplink. (iv) Offeror's will submit the planned proposed architecture for the system implementation. This will include a face elevation rack diagram and a topology that includes a description of wire type. The standard is met when documentation is provided with enough detail that the technical assessment team can determine viability of the proposal. (b) Offers will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis in their attempt to meet the conditions of the solicitation and the attatched PWS. Offers considered technically acceptable will be ranked by price with the award going to the lowest price with an acceptable rated offer. FACTOR 2 ­ Price Proposal (a) Price: Each offeror's proposed price will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism. (i) Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, as appropriate. (ii) Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished. (b) Financial Capability: The financial capability of the prime contractor, critical subcontractors, teaming contractors and/or joint venture partners will be evaluated to determine the offeror's capability to meet the fina ncial requirements of the solicitation. (c) Offerors shall propose on all items. Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge will be rejected as non-conforming to this solicitation. Offerors proposals will be evaluated for the lowest monthly price stated for each CLIN and SubCLIN by averaging the prices for each year. The averaged prices will be totaled to determine a total for all 5 of the evaluated years. The selected offeror for award will have the lowest averaged price for all of the evaluated years. (d) Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.
