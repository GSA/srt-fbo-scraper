The contractor shall have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, except: (1) As prohibited by federal law or regulation (e.g., export control or national security laws or regulations); (2) As expressly set forth in this contract; or (3) If the contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of this contract that contain restrictive markings, the contractor shall treat the data in accordance with such markings unless specifically authorized otherwise in writing by the contracting officer. (e) Unauthorized Marking of Data (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract concerning inspection or acceptance, if any data delivered under this contract are marked with the notices specified in paragraph (g)(3) or (g)(4) if included in this clause, and use of the notices is not authorized by this clause, or if the data bears any other restrictive or limiting markings not authorized by this contract, the contracting officer may at any time either return the data to the contractor, or cancel or ignore the markings. However, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253d, the following procedures shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings. (i) The contracting officer will make written inquiry to the contractor affording the contractor 60 days from receipt of the inquiry to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings; (ii) If the contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 60-day period (or a longer time approved in writing by the contracting officer for good cause shown), the judiciary shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions. (iii) If the contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the contracting officer shall consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the contracting officer determines that the markings are authorized, the contractor shall be so notified in writing. If the contracting officer determines, with concurrence of the judiciary Procurement Executive, that the markings are not authorized, the contracting officer will furnish the contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the contracting officer's decision. The judiciary will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the contracting officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the judiciary will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed. (2) Except to the extent the judiciary's action occurs as the result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, the contractor is not precluded by paragraph (e) of the clause from bringing a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, that may arise as the result of the judiciary removing or ignoring authorized markings on data delivered under this contract. (f) Omitted or Incorrect Markings (1) Data delivered to the judiciary without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The judiciary is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data. (2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the judiciary, the contractor may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the contracting officer in writing for good cause shown) after delivery of the data, permission to have authorized notices placed on the data at the contractor's expense. The contracting officer may agree to do so if the contractor: (i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied; (ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent; (iii) Establishes that the proposed notice is authorized; and (iv) Acknowledges that the judiciary has no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.

USCA12R0035 - Page 16 of 25

(3) If the data has been marked with an incorrect notice, the contracting officer may -(i) Permit correction at the contractor's expense if the contractor identifies the data and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized, or (ii) Correct any incorrect notices.

As a condition to this withholding, the contractor shall -(i) Identify the data being withheld; and (ii) Furnish form, fit, and function data instead. (2) Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer database for delivery to the judiciary shall be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software. (h) Subcontracting. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the contractor's obligations to the judiciary under this contract. If a subcontractor refuses to accept terms affording the judiciary those rights, the contractor shall promptly notify the contracting officer of the refusal and shall not proceed with subcontract award without authorization in writing from the contracting officer. (i) Relationship to Patents or Other Rights.

(a) (1) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that: (i) the offeror and/or any of its principals: (A) are __ are not __ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any federal agency; (B) have __ have not __, within the three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (C) are __ are not __ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) have __ have not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liablity is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should be taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankrupty protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). ii. The offeror __ has __ has not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any federal agency.

USCA12R0035 - Page 20 of 25

(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division, or business segment, and similar positions). This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may render the maker subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1001. (b) The offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the contracting officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the offeror's responsibility. Failure of the offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the contracting officer may render the offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing will be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the judiciary, the contracting officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (END) 3-30 Certificate of Independent Price Determination JAN 2003

(a) The offeror certifies that: (1) the prices in this offer have been arrived at independently, without, for the purpose of restricting competition, any consultation, communication, or agreement, with any other offeror or with any competitor relating to: (A) those prices; (B) the intention to submit an offer; or (C) the methods or factors used to calculate the prices offered. (2) The prices in this offer have not been and will not be knowingly disclosed by the offeror, directly or indirectly, to any other offeror or contract award unless otherwise required by law; and (3) no attempt has been made or will be made by the offeror to induce any other concern to submit or not to submit an offer for the purpose of restricting competition. (b) Each signature on the offer is considered to be a certification by the signatory that the signatory: (1) is the person in the offeror's organization responsible for determining the prices in this offer, and that the signatory has not participated, and will not participate, in any action contrary to paragraphs( (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision; or (2) (i) has been authorized, in writing, to act as agent for the following principals in certifying that those principals have not participated, and will not participate, in any action contrary to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision ___________________________________________________________________________ (insert full name of person(s) in the offeror's organization responsible for determining the prices in this offer, and the title of his or her position in the offeror's organization); (ii) as an authorized agent, does certify that the principals named in subdivision (b)(2)(i) of this provision; have not participated, and will not participate, in any action contrary to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision; and

If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements, the failure or refusal by the offeror to furnish the information may result in a 31 percent reduction of payments otherwise due under the contract. (c) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to payment recording requirements, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. (d) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN): ______________________________ [__] TIN has been applied for.

Pricing may be provided in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Adobe PDF, or WordPerfect format on a compact disc, and is to be submitted to the Contracting Officer at the address shown in Block 7 of the SF 33. A write- or password- protected Excel file is acceptable for pricing with proposal submission. However, should the offerer submit a write- or password- protected file, an additional editable file is also required. Submission of both files on the same disk is acceptable. (c) Technical Proposal: The Offeror is to address, at a minimum, the functional requirements listed in section C. For each requirement, the Offeror should indicate whether their product / service meets the requirement with a response of "Meets", "Partially Meets", or "Does Not Meet". Qualifying and/or supporting detail may be submitted for criteria marked as "Partially Meets". Such supporting detail should in no event exceed an aggregate total for all requirements of ten (10) pages of single-spaced text. Responses marked "Does Not Meet" for any Mandatory requirements will not be considered, except in the event that no submissions meet all of the Mandat-

ory requirements.

(d) Assumptions, Conditions, or Exceptions: The Offeror is to list all assumptions (if any), conditions, or exceptions upon which the Price and Technical Proposals are based. If not listed, it will be assumed that none exist, including any which may be imbedded in the Offeror's Technical and Price Proposals. L-4 Trial Access for Evaluation

In order to effectively evaluate the quality of the search results, the evaluation team requires access to the search tool for evaluation purposes. To that end, the offerors will provide access to the offered product / service for a period of two weeks to an evaluation team not to exceed six (6) distinct user access accounts. The evaluation team will perform no more than a total of thirty (30) searches during this evaluation period. At such time as thirty (30) searches have been completed, or after a two week period from initiating access, the Offeror may revoke evaluation access and close the evaluation accounts.

Date JAN 2003 JAN 2003

1. Proposals will be evaluated against the following technical criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance: (a) Mandatory requirements are met, (b) Other requirements (c) Quality of search results from evaluation access. 2. Contract award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements of the solicitation and represents the best overall value to the Government, given the outcome of the Government's evaluation of each Offeror's technical proposal and price. For this solicitation, technical merit is equally as important as price. In selecting the best overall value, the Government will consider the quality offered for the evaluated price. The relative ranking of offers will be based upon the Government's assessment of whether the technical merit offered in the proposal provides added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk. As technical merit of the offerors' proposals becomes more equal, the evaluated price may become the determining factor. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and price promises the greatest value to the Government.
