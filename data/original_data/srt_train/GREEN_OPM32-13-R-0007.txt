Applicability

This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act). The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act. (b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. (c) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. (d) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location. All contract employees must be:   Responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents. Responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times and ensuring the use FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption to protect information stored on digital media during transport outside of OPM controlled areas. Responsible for ensuring PII data at rest is encrypted in contractor and government Cloud computing environments.
Page 23 of 75





Responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.

(e) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network. Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure the PII is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals. PII must not be sent in the body of an email. Attachments containing PII must be encrypted. (f) IT Security Incident and PII Breach Protection and Notification

All security incidents that involve OPM information or information systems must be reported to the OPM Situation Room. Contractors must also report incidents to the OPM Contracting Officer. This reporting must occur immediately upon discovery of the incident. Incidents and breaches must be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM`s IT security experts will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention. The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail. 1. OPM contractors must report a breach or potential security breach to the OPM Situation Room at: sitroom@opm.gov, (202) 418-0111, Fax (202) 606-0624. 2.

(b) Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)

Note: the following Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is OPM`s codification of its method of implementing FAR 37.601, which requires that performance-based contracts or task ordersa) Describe the requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods of performance of the work; b) Use measurable performance standards (i.e., in terms of quality, timeliness, quantity, etc.) and quality assurance surveillance plans; c) Specify procedures for reductions of fee or for reductions to the price of a fixedprice contract when services are not performed or do not meet contract requirements; and d) Include performance incentives where appropriate. Offeror's must complete the QASP as part of their proposal. A description of the columns and information to be entered follows below. We will use the information provided as part of our evaluation of your offer. (1) (2) Deliverable: One of the deliverables described in the Deliverables section above. Performance Standard: The level of performance which the Government considers acceptable. A good performance standard in general should:  Measure important things;  Be simple, but not too simple;  Be auditable and capable of validation (quantifiable measures preferred, as they are less subjective);  Attainable and worth the cost;  Have a level of detail that corresponds to the intent of the stated measure and expectation;  Be consistently combined with other measures to reflect corporate priorities; and  Be controlled by the contractor.

(3) Acceptable Quality Level: The range of deviation--if any--in which the Government will consider performance to be acceptable. Each Offeror must propose an Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for each performance standard for each deliverable. If the selected Offeror fails to achieve stated AQLs, OPM will reduce the offeror`s payment for the services rendered in accordance with the disincentive formula. You must enter the AQLs for each deliverable in the Performance Requirements Summary Template for each deliverable that has a performance standard.

Page 45 of 75

(4)

Monitoring Method (a) This is the method OPM will use to monitor performance and determine the extent to which performance has met the standard. Offeror's are encouraged to propose a sound process for verifying the accuracy of performance data on a continuing or recurring basis. Regardless of the method or degree of monitoring, we reserve the right to audit all performance data to independently verify its accuracy. (b) In general, we prefer monitoring methods that automatically capture measurements as part of the process and do not place a burden on either the Offeror or OPM to collect and analyze data. (5) Incentive / Price Reduction (a) For each AQL, your proposal must specify a maximum price reduction that will take effect if you fail to meet the AQL. The proposal must also specify the formulas and decision criteria that we will use to calculate the actual amount of price reduction for the related CLIN. (b) OPM is willing to consider proposals that include additional incentives for performance that exceeds the AQL. These incentives may be either monetary or non-monetary. (i) For monetary incentives, your price proposal must specify a formula or set of decision criteria that we can use to calculate additional incentive payments to you. These incentive payments will only take place if you perform above the AQL. You must specify a maximum incentive payment that we will not be required to exceed, regardless of your performance. (ii) Some examples of non-monetary incentives that we would consider include, but are not necessarily limited to: Revised schedule Reduced oversight Positive performance evaluation Automatic extension of contract term or option exercise (FAR Part 17 still applies) Lengthened contract term (award term contracting) or purchase of extra items (award purchase) Publish article(s) in agency newsletter or speak at agency seminars Letters of appreciation to individual employees, which may translate to bonuses Use trade space for licensing, access to agency officials, etc. Use those FAR clauses that can be negotiated to your advantage (c) Your selection of AQLs, incentive formula and price reduction formula will be important to our evaluation. Your response must specify the proposed method for measuring your performance against each performance standard, which we will compare to relevant industry benchmarks.

If the offeror`s proposal is based on OPM paying a
Page 51 of 75

fixed amount per kwa, then the estimated monthly recurring cost for power would be based on the minimum 500 kva times the fixed amount per kva. 3. POTENTIAL AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS

The Government reserves the right to award without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer is fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary. 4. ALTERNATE PROPOSALS

Alternate proposals will not be considered. E.3 1. FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) GENERAL

The Government intends to award a single fixed price contract on a best value basis to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government. To be responsive, the Offeror must address all the requirements of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. 2. BASIS FOR AWARD

The Government is conducting this source selection using the Best Value Continuum, utilizing the Tradeoff Process at FAR 15.101-1; therefor the proposal that is determined to be the best value to the Government, given appropriate consideration to the evaluation factors will be awarded. The tradeoff method is used when it is in the Government`s best interest to consider award to other than lowest priced Offeror, or to other than the Offeror given the highest rating for noncost/price factors. Under the tradeoff approach, the Government evaluates both cost/price and other performance factors. Award is made to the Offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government, considering trade-offs between price/cost and the other factors. All evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their relative importance are provided below. 3. EVALUATION FACTORS AND ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

In making its award determination, OPM will consider the following evaluation factors in descending order of importance: Factor 1: Factor 2: Factor 3: Technical Past Performance Price

Page 52 of 75

Technical and Past Performance, when combined, is of more importance when compared to price. 3.1 Factor 1 - Technical

The Technical Factor will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the Offeror`s proposal demonstrates an understanding of the Government`s requirements in the Scope of Work (SOW), the technical quality of the proposed approach, and the Offeror`s ability to fulfill the requirements as outlined in the SOW. The Offeror`s Technical capabilities will be evaluated against the following criteria: 3.1.5 Technical compliance to the Bulleted Items in the Scope of Work. Reference Section E.2, Paragraph 2.2.1. The proposal will be evaluated based on the extent to which the proposal demonstrates meeting or exceeding all the bulleted items in the Scope of Work. 3.1.2 Organizational Structure and Management. Reference Section E.2, Paragraph 2.2.2. The Offeror`s proposed key staffing, teaming agreements, subcontractors, and service level agreements will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the requirement to be satisfied and the required tasks, services, and skill sets required to achieve program objectives. 3.1.3 Technical Approach and Understanding of the Requirement. Reference Section E.2, Paragraph 2.2.3. The proposal will be reviewed to determine the extent of the Offeror`s ability to meet objectives in the SOW as listed in Section E.2, Paragraph 2.3.3. 3.1.4 Implementation Time Table. Reference Section E.2, Paragraph 2.2.4. Subject to funds availability, the data center must be ready to accept OPM equipment within 120 days following the RFP close date. Offeror`s proposal shall be evaluated on the proposed implantation time table to meet this requirement, based on the assumption funds are made available and contract award is made within 60 days following the RFP close date. 3.1.5 Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). Reference Section E.2, Paragraph 2.2.5. Offeror`s proposed QASP will be reviewed and evaluated to determine the extent it to which it addresses deliverables and other measurable requirements within the Scope of Work. The Offeror`s technical proposal will be rated based on the following: Technical Ratings: Color Blue Green Rating Exceptional Acceptable Definition Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the OPM. Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.
Page 53 of 75

Color Red

Rating Unacceptable

Definition Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. The proposal is lacking in a certain area(s) of the requirement and cannot reasonably be expected to be made acceptable during any subsequent negotiation. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.

Risk Ratings: Rating High Definition Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring. Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties. Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties. Factor 2 ­ Past Performance.

Moderate

Low

3.2

Reference Section E.2, Paragraph 2.2.6. Past performance will be evaluated to determine the Offeror`s performance risk for this requirement. Past performance will be evaluated on how well the Offeror performed on previous contracts of similar scope and size at the project identified in this solicitation. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably, but will receive a neutral rating. The Offeror`s Past Performance shall be rated based on the following: Past Performance Ratings: Color Blue Definition Exceptional/High Confidence ­ Definition: Based on the offeror`s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Very Good/Significant Confidence - Definition: Based on the offeror`s performance record, little doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

Green

Color Orange

Definition Satisfactory/Confidence ­ Definition: Based on the offeror`s performance record, some doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Neutral/Unknown Confidence ­ Definition: No performance record identifiable. Marginal/Little Confidence ­ Definition: Based on the offeror`s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror`s existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. Unsatisfactory/No Confidence ­ Definition: Based on the offeror`s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

Past Performance Risk Ratings: Rating High Definition Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring. Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties. Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties. Price

Moderate

Low

3.3

While neither a weighted criterion nor a controlling factor, price will be an important evaluation consideration in selecting the Offeror under this solicitation. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced proposal if other non-priced evaluation factors justify the additional cost. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Cost/Price will be evaluated to determine if 1) the costs are realistic for the work to be performed, 2) costs reflect a clear understanding of the contract requirements, and 3) costs are inclusive of all services requested.

4.

COMPETITIVE RANGE

Based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the contracting officer shall establish a competitive range comprised of up to the 5 most highly rated proposal. Proposals no longer being included in the competitive range shall be eliminated from consideration for award. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful offeror`s. 5. SITE VISIT

The selective officials will perform a site visit of the most highly rated offeror`s included in the competitive range. The site visit shall include inspection of the facility to ensure the physical security, facility upkeep, maintenance, and other requirements identified in the SOW and offeror`s proposal are met. OPM will provide Offeror`s with adequate time to schedule site visits. All parties shall be responsible for their own transportation costs relative to the site visit. The Site Visit shall be evaluated using the following ratings: Technical Ratings: Color Blue Green Red Rating Exceptional Acceptable Unacceptable Definition Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the OPM. Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance. Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. The proposal is lacking in a certain area(s) of the requirement and cannot reasonably be expected to be made acceptable during any subsequent negotiation. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

Page 68 of 75

(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed End Product Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:
