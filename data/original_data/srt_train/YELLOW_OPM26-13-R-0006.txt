Solicitation: OPM26-13-R-0006 SECTION C ­ STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES C.1. Agency Information

Learning Management Systems (LMS) Hosting (AT10142b)  

The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM), Human Resources Solutions (HRS) enterprise provides services that assist the Federal Government in achieving their missions by: (1) partnering with agencies to provide effective human resource solutions that develop leaders, attract and build a high quality public sector workforce, and transform agencies into high performing organizations; and (2) offering services that enhance agencies' ability to attract and acquire specific talent. The Learning Management System (LMS) shared service provider, USALearningŽ, is a Program office in the HRS Directorate of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). GoLearnŽ was transitioned to USALearningŽ effective October 1, 2012. The mission of the USALearning Program Office ("Program Office") is to provide a full spectrum of web-based human capital performance (eHCP) tools, and the full range of web-based training content, including academic, technical, executive and organizational development courses to any Government employee, industry partner, state and local government employee in any media at any time. OPM has used a similar vehicle to support this program over the past several years. However, due to the recent reorganization at OPM, is has become necessary to solidify our support and resources to sustain our obligations to existing and future customers. C.2. Background

OPM is responsible for sustaining the goals of the e-Training initiative. This solicitation identifies requirements for services to further advance the goals of this important initiative and the President's Management Agenda through the USALearningŽ Program. The Program Office is responsible for Learning Management Services for large agencies and customized Learning Systems, provided in various configurations to support small agency requirements. In November 2001, OPM was designated as the managing partner of the e-Training Initiative, which was one of 24 E-Gov projects. Shortly thereafter, OPM entered into a partnership with the Department of Transportation (DOT) Transportation Administrative Service Center (TASC) organization and the Transportation Virtual University (TVU) to develop and implement what was known as GoLearnŽ. As the E-Gov program and initiatives matured, the Government online learning program also has evolved. Contracting vehicles have been modified and redundant vehicles eliminated. Under the current umbrella of USALearningŽ, OPM provides educational and training services to multiple agencies to satisfy their annual training requirements through the use of shared and dedicated environments to maximize the cost savings to the Government. OPM has brought in additional client agencies that have specific needs but are currently rolled into a joint business case with a standard relationship between OPM and these agencies. This has helped to identify the need to establish a sound business model to simplify and unify the infrastructure across the Government. This vehicle has obtained state-of-the-industry, online training services, web-based Human Capital Performance (eHCP) tools, educational instruction and the supporting technology and services needed to enable Government employees to achieve training, educational and professional development goals. C.3. Scope

In support of its mission, the OPM USA Learning Program Office needs Contractor services to support the Government Online Learning Center, and e-Training Program by providing IT Hosting

b. Strategy The BPA is intended to create an efficient, productive, cost-efficient alternative for our Federal clients. OPM will move from its current state (Phase 0) (see diagram below) to a transitional state (Phase 1) and ultimately to final state (Phase 2) as the periods of performance on existing contracts expire.

c. Transition A smooth and orderly transition between the Contractor and the predecessor Contractor is necessary to assure minimum disruption to vital Contractor services and Government activities. The Contractor shall not disrupt official Government business or in any way interfere with the assigned duties of the predecessor Contractor's employees. The Contractor may notify the predecessor Contractor's employees that the Contractor will be assuming services upon the Contract start date and may distribute business cards, employment applications, brochures, and other company information to the predecessor Contractor's employees while they are on duty, provided that there is no interference with the Contract employee's assigned duties (e.g., during "off hours" or during relief or lunch breaks). However, the Contractor shall not interview, recruit, schedule interviews, or conduct extensive discussions with the predecessor Contractor's employees while they are on duty. The Integrator will provide a documented transition plan for the successful consolidation of existing hosting facilities to one federally certified and accredited hosting facility. This effort is in support of the federally mandated Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI). The transition is expected to require a minimum of one (1) year to be completed. Periods of performance, expiration dates and the complexity of the consolidation effort must be considered and incorporated into an integrated project plan. The draft project plan will require close coordination between the Hosting and IT Security Services providers, to ensure all required certifications, authorities to operate, data center moves (if required), data migration, interconnectivity agreements are orchestrated without

service interruption to existing customers. The final transition plan must be approved in writing by the CO prior to implementation. The Integrator will include as a part of the integrated project plan, the critical elements (Hosting, Security, Help Desk Services) and actions required by each Contractor on the LMS Support team to smoothly implement and/or sustain continuity of services for existing clients. The Integrator will provide a draft plan within 60 days of award of the BPA. Figure C.1 provides a graphical representation of the anticipated tasks and preliminary phases. The Integrator may provide alternative approaches; however these alternatives must incorporate the key elements as identified within this Statement of Objectives. The successful Offeror must address its ability and willingness to cooperate fully with the transition plans approved by the CO and will document that planned cooperation and support in its proposal in the appropriate area of the technical approach. d. Site Visit / Survey A Site survey will be required. Facilities that are currently providing these services should reference the same in past performance language as a part of their technical proposal. Offerors must demonstrate and document the ability to undergo assessment and accreditation within 60 days of BPA Call award and not later than 90 days thereafter. Sites will be evaluated IAW specific controls outlined in NIST SP 800-53 Rev 4, applicable to such facilities, and IAW Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI). Site surveys will be coordinated and scheduled with the OPM Program Office within 30 days after BPA Call award. e. Contractor Furnished Materials / Information The Contractor will supply hardware, software and/or services required to support an enterprise level hosting facility.. In the event that data is migrated from one (1) Contractor platform or system to another, the BPA Call will include specific requirements for how data will be handled, stored, secured, data schema, mapping, and provided to OPM and other Contractors. These requirements will be detailed in the BPA Call. Included in the license agreements required to support this BPA are all the necessary rights needed to operate the specified software for its useful life in the specified environment. OPM is required to hold confidential such information as we may learn in the course of contract performance.

supporting LMS internet web sites. Data systems shall be secured and protected from remote intrusion, hackers, virus infections and service denial schemes. g. Hosting IT Security The web host, LMS software, and content provider sites must implement and maintain security measures aimed at preventing unauthorized access to Federal client networks, information systems, infrastructure support systems, and telecommunication services supporting the Federal clients Internet web sites. Information systems must be secured and protected from remote intrusion, hackers, virus infections, and service denial schemes as described throughout this Specification. The web site host system shall be configured for National Security Agency (NSA) Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) security (see http://www.nsa.gov/isso/bao/cpep.html). Access to system by Federal clients, e.g., clients responsible for the content of the web pages, files or other information or instructions shall have read-only access (or the most current specification). Host configurations further limit permeability, for example but not limited to the following: 1) The host site must employ system controls to ensure files and directories of the system are only exported to Government-designated host systems and facilities. Re-hosting of files allowing remote log in from a trusted machine without password access control is not permitted. 2) The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) home directory and root privileges must be writeprotected against anyone other than host site personnel authorized with access to root. All access shall be recorded in the audit control system for monitoring and tracking all access activities. The host site shall employ system controls to ensure all system software, applications, data, hardware configuration, connectivity, and permissions settings cannot be altered in an unauthorized fashion during processing, storage, and transmission. A subscription to the host security issues mailing list (electronic notification) must be maintained and aggressively acted upon by the host site (e.g., any potential security holes are identified and recommended solutions are implemented quickly). All non-essential services on host site servers are removed. Where UNIX or Windows-based operating systems are used, servers must be configured in accordance with NSA guidelines on server vulnerabilities. All web servers must be configured in accordance with NSA guidelines on secure Web site configurations. Where available, guidance from NIST on secure implementation of operating systems and web servers must be used. Current guidance includes NIST SP 800-43, Systems Administration Guidance for Windows 2000 Professional, SP 800-40, Procedures for Handling Security Patches, and SP 800-44, Guidelines on Securing Public Web Servers. The host site must notify all Federal clients' POCs and the COR a minimum of five (5) days in advance of any planned system downtime that will impact or diminish the performance of the system for the users. Notification shall include the reason, the start time, an estimate of the impact on the operation of the system and the time the system is to be returned to full operational status. The host site must take the necessary steps to insure that when the system

The host site must provide the reasons for the failure, steps being taken to restore the system to normal operation, and an estimate of the time the system will be out of service. The host site must exercise diligent and prudent management of the system and security measures to identify and eliminate all virus attacks prior to the system becoming infected. If there is a successful virus attack, the host site shall notify the above persons immediately. In the event an attack is successful the host site must take all necessary steps to disable and remove the virus, secure the system from another attack, and restore the system to normal operation When an analysis of the attack indicates a planned and directed attack from an unknown but consistent source or domain, the host site must implement service denial measures to mitigate a repeat of the attack. When service denial measures are anticipated by the host, site, the host site must notify the above persons immediately and provide an explanation of the need to implement service denial steps and the potential consequences of delaying such action. The report shall identify any weaknesses in the security systems and recommend what actions should be taken to correct any deficiencies to minimize a repeat of the attack. The host site must perform real-time monitoring of traffic to find possible denial of service attacks (trying to block access to a web site by flooding a site with data requests). The host site shall immediately take all necessary steps described in the preceding bullets. The host site must implement the capability to store audit logs both on and off line and provide a mechanism for remote access by appropriate Governmental law enforcement personnel as needed.

This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act). The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act. (b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. (c) Responsibilities for Handling PII

(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor.

Email cannot be encrypted. Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment. Do not send PII in the content of an email. (d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

(1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network. Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment. OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip. Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments. It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agency's network. (2) e-mail. (e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII A password protected file is not secure. Never send any unencrypted PII data in

(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic. As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information. In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. (2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk ­ regardless of the time or day of the week. Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM's IT security experts will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention. The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

 (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);  (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;  (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

Solicitation OPM26-13-R-0006

Learning Management Systems (LMS) Hosting (AT10142b)

  case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Addendum to FAR 52.212-2

M.3.1. Evaluation and Award The Government intends to award BPAs to multiple Contractors subject to the constraints listed in Section D.1, Requirement. In making its award determination, the Government will consider the following evaluation factors in descending order of importance:  Factor 1: Understanding of Federal IT policy and guidance; the Statement of Objectives
Page 95 of 109

Solicitation OPM26-13-R-0006  

Learning Management Systems (LMS) Hosting (AT10142b)

with associated strategy and a full and thorough understanding of the intent of the Integrator Model as depicted in the SOO and documented in the offeror's Technical Approach    Factor 2: IT Resources/Personnel Qualifications/Staffing Factor 3: Past performance Factor 4: Corporate experience in the design, development, implementation, operation, management or maintenance of LMS systems and supporting services in a Federal Environment. Factor 5: Price



Each proposal will be evaluated with respect to Technical, IT Resources, Past Performance, Corporate Experience, and Price. Technical, IT Resources, Past Performance, and Corporate Experience factors are of equal importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than Price. If there are no significant technical differences among offerors, they are determined to be `technically equal' and price will be the determining factor for award. A. Technical Proposal Evaluation 1. To be considered responsive, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified in Section L, SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS/PROPOSALS (Instructions to Offerors). Offerors whose proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at OPM's discretion, to remedy the deficiency by submitting additional clarifying or supplemental information. However, the offeror runs the risk that OPM may not allow the offeror to submit additional information or clarify the proposal and be deemed non-responsive. 2. Responsive proposals shall be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response. Accordingly, the objective of this evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Objectives and the required proposal format and content, Section V, SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS/PROPOSALS (Instructions to Offerors). 3. Technical proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation instructions. Proposals that are very deficient in this area as to not warrant further consideration will be rejected and the offeror will be so notified. 4. OPM will evaluate proposals against the following technical factors in descending order of importance: FACTOR 1: Understanding of Federal IT policy and guidance; the Statement of Objectives with associated strategy and a full and thorough understanding of the intent of the Integrator Model as depicted in the SOO and documented in the offeror's Technical Approach The offeror shall provide a written description demonstrating its understanding of the nature and extent of OPM's requirement for IT and supporting services as described in this RFP. This

Learning Management Systems (LMS) Hosting (AT10142b)

narrative must indicate an understanding of the Federal IT policies and guidance related to the services for which they are proposing. This narrative must be more than a mere repetition of the descriptions provided in the solicitation. At a minimum, your narrative should, include the following: (1) Indicate your understanding of the nature and extent of the type of work to be performed for OPM, and indicate your firm's capability of meeting these types of requirements and corporate experience. (2) Indicate your understanding for the Federal IT policy and guidance applicable to the services for which you are proposing. (3) Indicate the initial plan to gain understanding of OPM's operational and business needs. (4) Provide a plan for staffing projects once identified. Describe how you will manage the work of your staff and how you will ensure quality control. (5) Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise during performance of a BPA Call.

FACTOR 2: IT Resources/Personnel Qualifications/Staffing In this section, the offeror shall provide the resumes of the proposed principal/point of contact, other key personnel, and supporting personnel, as well as a staffing plan. Offerors shall provide definitions of the experience/education/expertise levels required for the labor categories proposed for performing the services required under the RFP Required Service Areas (RSAs). Resumes should present sufficient information to determine the proposed individual's qualifications to successfully perform the required services. The contractor shall provide a letter of intent for all proposed key personnel. FACTOR 3: Past performance Quality of Work products, timeliness of deliverables, staffing retention, cost control, business relations, and customer satisfaction. In this section the offeror shall provide summary descriptions of work undertaken by the offeror for Federal, state or local government agencies or with commercial entities that substantiate its ability to perform work of the kind described in Section C of the RFP. NOTE: OPM reserves the right to consider the offeror's past performance not specifically listed in the Technical Proposal. Offerors may also include in this section a description of any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high quality process for producing the service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other Government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three (3) years

old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. FACTOR 4: Corporate experience in the design, development, implementation, operation, management or maintenance of LMS systems and supporting services in a Federal Environment. The offeror will provide evidence that demonstrates the capability to provide the full range of services for which they are proposing. The evidence will also demonstrate that the offeror has the capacity to respond to a growth in support service requests in a timely manner. B. Price Proposal Evaluation FACTOR 5: Price ­ Not rated, but will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. A price is considered reasonable if that price does not exceed what a prudent person would normally incur in conducting competitive business. In determining whether offeror prices are reasonable, the proposed labor rates, labor skill mix and other rates proposed to the Government for prime, team member and subcontractor labor must reflect the use of prudent judgment and sound business practice. Sound business practice includes compliance with governing regulations about estimating and accounting assumptions supporting proposed labor. The Price Proposal shall be submitted in accordance with Volume II ­ Business / Pricing Proposal instructions and shall include pricing for the base and option years and shall be submitted in Microsoft Excel 2007 format for electronic copies. Offerors must submit their price proposal based on the pricing contained in their published price list and/or GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), if applicable. Offerors are encouraged to provide discounts from their published price list and/or FSS Schedule prices. Offerors shall include in their proposed rates, all costs to the Government associated with accomplishing the required RSAs, including direct labor, fringe benefits, G&A, overhead, profit or fee where applicable. The Government reserves the right to evaluate offerors and award a contract without discussion. Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and plan/experience/past performance standpoint. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
