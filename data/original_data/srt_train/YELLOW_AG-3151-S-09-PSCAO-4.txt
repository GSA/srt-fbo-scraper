E.3   Incentives




E.3.1 In the event the Contractor fails to meet the minimum performance requirement or MER criteria  as  specified  above,  the  Government  will
      require the following:  If the Contractor fails to meet the minimum response criteria more than two (2) times in  a  quarter  .5%  will  be
      deducted weekly until performance criteria are met.  If Contractor exceeds the minimum response criteria for all  tasks  by  3%  associated
      with a deliverable, then the Contractor will receive a very good or  above  performance  evaluation  for  the  deliverable  which  will  be
      reflected in their overall rating.  As part of the past performance evaluation of this and future contracts special attention will be  paid
      to the Contractor’s initiative and ability to suggest and implement costs savings and efficiencies

G.2   Work Deliverable Process


      Step 1:  The COTR either generates or receives the deliverable, including completion criteria, for work to be performed on the contract.

     a. For FFP tasks - if the effort is already outlined in enough detail for performance in the contract a deliverable is not required.
      b.    The CO determines the proposed period of performance; identifies deliverables that will be required; and the estimated labor
        assignment; identify the SOO reference paragraphs; and identify the task title.
      c.    The COTR may, if considered appropriate, discuss with Contractor during this step.

      Action:  The COTR sends the initial Deliverable to the CO for initial review.


      Step 2:  The CO reviews the Deliverable, compares it to the contract document, and makes the determination that is adequate.
        a. SOO reference is considered appropriate.
        b. Deliverable is within the scope of the SOO.
        c. Confirms that no modification is required.
           d.    If a modification is required, the modification must be completed before the additional work is assigned by the Contracting
              Officer in Step 5.


      Action:  The CO sends the Task description to the Contractor’s established point of contact for a SOW.

      Step 3:  The Contractor reviews the deliverable.  The Contractor either
           a. Accepts the proposed/estimated information by copying the proposed/estimated information to the negotiated section
           b. Proposes a new amount or date by completing the negotiated section with adjusted information.
           c.     In this case the Contractor should have a conversation with the CO before signing the deliverable to confirm the negotiation.

      Step 4:  The CO reviews the negotiated information and confirms his/her agreement with any changes.


      Action:  The CO signs the work definition and sends it to the Contractor.


      Step 5:  The Contractor reviews the negotiated changes and confirms his/her agreement with any changes.


      Action:  The CO signs the work definition and sends it to the COTR and the Contractor POC.


      Action:  The electronic version of the deliverable will be maintained in shared location.  It is anticipated that it will be maintained in
      SharePoint.

      Step 6:  Work is performed.  The Contractor completes the information on the deliverable.
           a. As deliverables are completed, the completion date on the deliverables checklist is completed.
           b. As deliverables are approved, the completion approval information is completed.
           c. The actual start and completion dates are completed.
           d. The actual labor assignment for LH is completed.


      Action:  The Contractor POC signs and submits the completed deliverables for completion review to the COTR.

M     Evaluation Factors for Award


M.1   General


M.1.1 The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained  in
      Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 15.


M.1.2 In accordance with FAR 52.215-1(f) the Government intends to award contracts to the responsible  Offerors  whose  proposal  represents  the
      best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides
      the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors  listed
      in this section.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals
      to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This  effort  will  include  comparing  the  strengths,  weaknesses  and  risks
      associated with each offer.


M.1.3 The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with Offerors except clarifications  if  necessary  as
      described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the Offeror’s initial proposal.  Therefore,  the  initial  proposal
      should contain the Offerors’ best terms from a technical and cost/price standpoint.

M.1.4 When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by Offerors in their proposals, as well as data  obtained  from  other
      sources.  Each Offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.


M.2   Basis for Award

M.2.1 The Government will award contracts to the responsible Offerors whose proposals are the most advantageous  to  the  Government,  price  and
      other factors considered.

M.3   Evaluation Factors

M.3.1 Statement of Work


M.3.1.1     The Statement of Work will be evaluated either technically acceptable or technically not acceptable. If the Statement of Work is
       deemed technically acceptable, then the proposal will be further evaluated. If the Statement of Work is deemed technically not
       acceptable, then the proposal will not be reviewed for further evaluation.

M.3.2 The selection decision will be based on the following factors:

        a) Non-Price Factors:


                       Factor 1:  Key Personnel
                       Factor 2:  Staffing Plan
                       Factor 3:  Technical Approach
                       Factor 4:  Past Performance/Technical Expertise


           (b)   Price and Other Factors:
                 Factor 1:  Exceptions and Deviations
                 Factor 2:  Cost/Price Proposal


M.3.3       Order of Importance:  Each non-price factor is more  important  than  the  price  factor  and  together  the  non-price  factors  are
      significantly more important than the price factor. Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal to one another and Factor 3 and Factor 4 are  equal  to
      one another.  Factor 1 and Factor 2 are more important than either Factor 3 or Factor 4.


M.3.3 Factor 1: Key Personnel

M.3.3.1     The Government will evaluate the  resumes  of  the  Key  Personnel  proposed.  Individual  resumes  will  be  evaluated  against  the
       requirements identified in the base contract and in  the  Statement  of  Work  on  their  knowledge  and  past  background,  professional
       background, and work experience relevant to the requirements herein as  well  as  their  commitment  and  availability  to  the  project.
       Experience and education that exceed the minimum position requirements such that it has a beneficial impact on the successful performance
       of the effort will receive a higher score.  Submission of resumes that do not meet the minimum position requirements will  result  in  an
       unacceptable rating.  Resumes submitted that are not required by this solicitation will not be evaluated.


M.3.4 Factor 2:  Staffing Plan


M.3.4.1     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s staffing plan for understanding of the complexity of the effort proposed including  needed
       labor categories and special skills. Emphasis will be placed on personnel currently available with the specific skills required  for  the
       effort proposed.

M.3.4.2     For large businesses use of small and small disadvantaged subcontractors will be evaluated.  Large businesses are advised  that  they
       are required to work towards meeting the goals of their base contracts.

M.3.5 Factor 3:  Technical Approach


M.3.5.1     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s intent,  technical  capabilities  and  plans  to  achieve  the  Contract  requirements  in
       accordance with FSA standards and methodologies.  This approach shall include Offeror’s capabilities and experience in  supporting  large
       mission critical, multi-platform systems; providing time critical customer support; performing effective production  problem  resolution;
       and proactive approach to ensure maximum system availability and data integrity.

M.3.5.2     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s approach to the design, development, testing, and  maintenance  of  web  based  platforms,
       incorporating both on-line, and batch processing as well as a variety of system interfaces, including, but not limited  to,  on-line  web
       transactions, web services, batch transaction input via FTP, business to  business  transaction  processing,  etc.  The  Government  will
       evaluate the Offeror’s knowledge  of  the  content  of  the  work  in  terms  of  its  component  activities,  inputs  and  outputs,  and
       interrelationships and interdependencies; ability to recognize the appropriate  sequence  and  realistic  duration  of  work  activities;
       knowledge of appropriate types of resources required to perform the work and of their appropriate  allocation  to  the  work  activities;
       familiarity with the difficulties, uncertainties, and risks associated with the work,  and  knowledge  of  the  personnel  qualifications
       necessary to perform the work.

M.3.5.3     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s level of realism, and demonstrating to complete the requirement following FSA  procedures.



M.3.5.4     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s evidence that they have identified the key technical task  areas  that  require  technical
       assistance in implementation and guidance of the solution and will be evaluated as to appropriateness,  comprehensiveness  and  technical
       soundness.

M.3.5.5     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s quality control measure to consistently to the Government requirements, CLIN,  tasks,  and
       objectives.  The Government will also evaluate how the Offeror intends to implement the quality control measures to reduce the chances of
       reoccurring issues.



M.3.6 Factor 4: Past Performance/Technical Expertise


M.3.6.1     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s past performance  to  examine  how  the  Offeror’s  past  performance  demonstrates  their
       capability and capacity to perform tasks similar to the ones on  this  Contract.   The  past  performance  evaluation  will  examine  the
       Offeror’s actual performance on up to three (3) efforts.  This review will focus on the size, scope and complexity of  the  efforts,  and
       relevance.  Responses that show relevance in fewer past performance examples will receive a higher score.

M.3.6.2     The Offeror shall indicate if it has no relevant past performance.  A declaration of no past performance will  result  in  a  neutral
       rating.  Submission of past performance examples that are considered to be non-relevant instead of a declaration of no  past  performance
       will result in a score lower than neutral.

M.3.6.3     The Government reserves the right to contact customers that you identify and solicit  further  information  about  your  performance.
       The accuracy of the data, including contact information, is the full responsibility of the Offeror and  inaccuracy  may  result  in  non-
       consideration of the reference.  Other related past performance information may be  sought  and  used  for  evaluating  completeness  and
       accuracy of the Offeror’s proposal.  Past performance may be obtained from a variety of sources including  other  government  contracting
       project managers, other government contracting activities reports and GAO Defense Procurement  Fraud  Information.   Other  related  past
       performance information may be sought and used for evaluating completeness and accuracy  of  the  Offeror’s  proposals.   Evaluators  may
       consider performance on contracts not submitted by the Offeror if they have knowledge  of  contracts  not  listed  or  if  contracts  are
       discovered during interviews that were not listed.

M.3.6.4     The assessment of the Offeror’s performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of  the  Offeror’s  proposal  and
       the relative capability of the Offeror.  A record of marginal or unacceptable past performance may be considered an indication  that  the
       ability of the Offeror to perform the contract as proposed may be questionable.

M.3.6.5     A less than satisfactory effort on all of the Offeror’s Contracts under FAST combined may result in a reduction  of  points  in  this
       factor.

M.3.7 Cost/Price Proposal


M.3.7.1     The Government will review the Offeror’s proposal for cost realism, reasonableness, and understanding of the requirements.



M.4   Scoring


M.4.1 Capability rating standards focus on the strengths and deficiencies of the  Offeror’s  proposal.   Capability  shall  be  rated  using  the
       ratings listed in the table below.  If an Offeror’s proposal demonstrates a material failure to meet a government requirement, this is  a
       deficiency in the Offeror’s proposal resulting in an Unacceptable rating and the proposal is not awardable.

E.3   Incentives




E.3.1 In the event the Contractor fails to meet the minimum performance requirement or MER criteria  as  specified  above,  the  Government  will
      require the following:  If the Contractor fails to meet the minimum response criteria more than two (2) times in  a  quarter  .5%  will  be
      deducted weekly until performance criteria are met.  If Contractor exceeds the minimum response criteria for all  tasks  by  3%  associated
      with a deliverable, then the Contractor will receive a very good or  above  performance  evaluation  for  the  deliverable  which  will  be
      reflected in their overall rating.  As part of the past performance evaluation of this and future contracts special attention will be  paid
      to the Contractor’s initiative and ability to suggest and implement costs savings and efficiencies

G.2   Work Deliverable Process


      Step 1:  The COTR either generates or receives the deliverable, including completion criteria, for work to be performed on the contract.

     b. For FFP tasks - if the effort is already outlined in enough detail for performance in the contract a deliverable is not required.
      b.    The CO determines the proposed period of performance; identifies deliverables that will be required; and the estimated labor
        assignment; identify the SOO reference paragraphs; and identify the task title.
      c.    The COTR may, if considered appropriate, discuss with Contractor during this step.

      Action:  The COTR sends the initial Deliverable to the CO for initial review.


      Step 2:  The CO reviews the Deliverable, compares it to the contract document, and makes the determination that is adequate.
        d. SOO reference is considered appropriate.
        e. Deliverable is within the scope of the SOO.
        f. Confirms that no modification is required.
           d.    If a modification is required, the modification must be completed before the additional work is assigned by the Contracting
              Officer in Step 5.


      Action:  The CO sends the Task description to the Contractor’s established point of contact for a SOW.

      Step 3:  The Contractor reviews the deliverable.  The Contractor either
           c. Accepts the proposed/estimated information by copying the proposed/estimated information to the negotiated section
           d. Proposes a new amount or date by completing the negotiated section with adjusted information.
           c.     In this case the Contractor should have a conversation with the CO before signing the deliverable to confirm the negotiation.


      Action:  The Contractor signs the deliverable and sends it to the CO.


      Step 4:  The CO reviews the negotiated information and confirms his/her agreement with any changes.


      Action:  The CO signs the work definition and sends it to the Contractor.


      Step 5:  The Contractor reviews the negotiated changes and confirms his/her agreement with any changes.


      Action:  The CO signs the work definition and sends it to the COTR and the Contractor POC.


      Action:  The electronic version of the deliverable will be maintained in shared location.  It is anticipated that it will be maintained in
      SharePoint.

      Step 6:  Work is performed.  The Contractor completes the information on the deliverable.

M     Evaluation Factors for Award


M.1   General


M.1.1 The Government is conducting this source selection in accordance with the competitive negotiation source selection procedures contained  in
      Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 15.


M.1.2 In accordance with FAR 52.215-1(f) the Government intends to award contracts to the responsible  Offerors  whose  proposal  represents  the
      best value.  Per FAR Part 2, best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides
      the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The Government will conduct the best value analysis using the factors  listed
      in this section.  In performing its best value analysis, the Government will compare any relevant differences among the evaluated proposals
      to determine which proposal offers the overall best value.  This  effort  will  include  comparing  the  strengths,  weaknesses  and  risks
      associated with each offer.


M.1.3 The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with Offerors except clarifications  if  necessary  as
      described in FAR 15.306(a) and will evaluate each offer on the basis of the Offeror’s initial proposal.  Therefore,  the  initial  proposal
      should contain the Offerors’ best terms from a technical and cost/price standpoint.

M.1.4 When conducting the evaluation, the Government may use data included by Offerors in their proposals, as well as data  obtained  from  other
      sources.  Each Offeror is responsible for ensuring that the information provided is thorough, accurate, and complete.


M.2   Basis for Award

M.2.1 The Government will award contracts to the responsible Offerors whose proposals are the most advantageous  to  the  Government,  price  and
      other factors considered.

M.3   Evaluation Factors

M.3.1 Statement of Work


M.3.1.1     The Statement of Work will be evaluated either technically acceptable or technically not acceptable. If the Statement of Work is
       deemed technically acceptable, then the proposal will be further evaluated. If the Statement of Work is deemed technically not
       acceptable, then the proposal will not be reviewed for further evaluation.

M.3.2 The selection decision will be based on the following factors:

        b) Non-Price Factors:


                       Factor 1:  Key Personnel
                       Factor 2:  Staffing Plan
                       Factor 3:  Technical Approach
                       Factor 4:  Past Performance/Technical Expertise


           (b)   Price and Other Factors:
                 Factor 1:  Exceptions and Deviations
                 Factor 2:  Cost/Price Proposal


M.3.3       Order of Importance:  Each non-price factor is more  important  than  the  price  factor  and  together  the  non-price  factors  are
      significantly more important than the price factor. Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal to one another and Factor 3 and Factor 4 are  equal  to
      one another.  Factor 1 and Factor 2 are more important than either Factor 3 or Factor 4.


M.3.3 Factor 1: Key Personnel

M.3.3.1     The Government will evaluate the  resumes  of  the  Key  Personnel  proposed.  Individual  resumes  will  be  evaluated  against  the

       background, and work experience relevant to the requirements herein as  well  as  their  commitment  and  availability  to  the  project.
       Experience and education that exceed the minimum position requirements such that it has a beneficial impact on the successful performance
       of the effort will receive a higher score.  Submission of resumes that do not meet the minimum position requirements will  result  in  an
       unacceptable rating.  Resumes submitted that are not required by this solicitation will not be evaluated.


M.3.4 Factor 2:  Staffing Plan


M.3.4.1     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s staffing plan for understanding of the complexity of the effort proposed including  needed
       labor categories and special skills. Emphasis will be placed on personnel currently available with the specific skills required  for  the
       effort proposed.

M.3.4.2     For large businesses use of small and small disadvantaged subcontractors will be evaluated.  Large businesses are advised  that  they
       are required to work towards meeting the goals of their base contracts.

M.3.5 Factor 3:  Technical Approach

       assistance in implementation and guidance of the solution and will be evaluated as to appropriateness,  comprehensiveness  and  technical
       soundness.

M.3.5.5     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s quality control measure to consistently to the Government requirements, CLIN,  tasks,  and
       objectives.  The Government will also evaluate how the Offeror intends to implement the quality control measures to reduce the chances of
       reoccurring issues.



M.3.6 Factor 4: Past Performance/Technical Expertise


M.3.6.1     The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s past performance  to  examine  how  the  Offeror’s  past  performance  demonstrates  their
       capability and capacity to perform tasks similar to the ones on  this  Contract.   The  past  performance  evaluation  will  examine  the
       Offeror’s actual performance on up to three (3) efforts.  This review will focus on the size, scope and complexity of  the  efforts,  and
       relevance.  Responses that show relevance in fewer past performance examples will receive a higher score.

M.3.6.2     The Offeror shall indicate if it has no relevant past performance.  A declaration of no past performance will  result  in  a  neutral
       rating.  Submission of past performance examples that are considered to be non-relevant instead of a declaration of no  past  performance
       will result in a score lower than neutral.

M.3.6.3     The Government reserves the right to contact customers that you identify and solicit  further  information  about  your  performance.
       The accuracy of the data, including contact information, is the full responsibility of the Offeror and  inaccuracy  may  result  in  non-
       consideration of the reference.  Other related past performance information may be  sought  and  used  for  evaluating  completeness  and
       accuracy of the Offeror’s proposal.  Past performance may be obtained from a variety of sources including  other  government  contracting
       project managers, other government contracting activities reports and GAO Defense Procurement  Fraud  Information.   Other  related  past
       performance information may be sought and used for evaluating completeness and accuracy  of  the  Offeror’s  proposals.   Evaluators  may
       consider performance on contracts not submitted by the Offeror if they have knowledge  of  contracts  not  listed  or  if  contracts  are
       discovered during interviews that were not listed.

M.3.6.4     The assessment of the Offeror’s performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of  the  Offeror’s  proposal  and
       the relative capability of the Offeror.  A record of marginal or unacceptable past performance may be considered an indication  that  the
       ability of the Offeror to perform the contract as proposed may be questionable.

M.3.6.5     A less than satisfactory effort on all of the Offeror’s Contracts under FAST combined may result in a reduction  of  points  in  this
       factor.

M.3.7 Cost/Price Proposal


M.3.7.1     The Government will review the Offeror’s proposal for cost realism, reasonableness, and understanding of the requirements.



M.4   Scoring


M.4.1 Capability rating standards focus on the strengths and deficiencies of the  Offeror’s  proposal.   Capability  shall  be  rated  using  the
       ratings listed in the table below.  If an Offeror’s proposal demonstrates a material failure to meet a government requirement, this is  a
       deficiency in the Offeror’s proposal resulting in an Unacceptable rating and the proposal is not awardable.
