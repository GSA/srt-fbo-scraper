Column two documents the agency's accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable. Place a Yes or No in this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to the expected deliverable?) Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in providing accessibility information. Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision. Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision. It is also an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as applicable.

Statement of Work Project Title: Department: NIH Clinical Center ­ Cart Washer Replacement Clinical Center/National Institutes of Health/ Materials Management & Environmental Services (MMESD)

NIHCL2013153

Background The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) is the onsite hospital for the NIH campus. The Materials Management and Environment Services Department (MMESD) are responsible for the acquisition of supplies, inventory management, and storage and distribution of materials for the hospital. In addition, the department ensures efficient housekeeping operations and compliance with appropriate infection prevention, safety, OSHA, Joint Commission and regulatory standards. This includes cleaning of the NIH Clinical Center patient rooms, offices, ancillary departments, outpatient areas, public areas (including cafeterias), laboratories in the CRC, and the Family Lodge, and the provision of laundry services. Purpose The NIH Clinical Center, Materials Management and Environments Services Department (MMESD) have a requirement to procure two (2) cart washers. These cart washers are to replace the existing cart washers that have reached the end of their life cycles. Scope of Work The cart washers will be used to clean, sanitize and maintain our existing fleet of approximately 150 plus Sani-wash trash carts (Model TC-35-FLX). Note: carts contain lid that are controlled by lift struts. Specifications The following specifications are the salient requirements the Government is requesting for the two (2) replacement Cart Washers: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The cabinet of each unit shall be constructed of UL Class 2 rated fiberglass and anodized aluminum (minimum requirement) Size Dimensions no greater than 90Wx100L x 95H Overall Weight: not greater than 3000lbs Pit Depth: 9 inches, Floor mounts plus 5 inches Units must contain an internal in use service light An internal emergency stop switch shall be included to avoid and terminate unintended operation.

The cart washer must be designed with a UL classified 508B fully Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based processor control keypad. This keypad will control the following required functions: o zone stationary spraying o operating times must be field adjustable using the PLC keypad. o keypad must display operating sequences and cycle positions. o proper spraying pattern depending on the bin or shelf types of carts to be accommodated. Zoned spraying should be at 60PSI (lower pressure) which will create larger micron water droplets for optimum delivery of cleaning and sanitizing chemicals. The cart washers must have the ability for the operator to increase the concentration of cleaning inside the cart. A 60+% concentration is required for the cleaning inside of cart. A non-rotating boom model is required. Cart washers must have an adjustable water system and use not more than 9 gallons of water per cycle. Automatic injection of detergent/sanitizer and rinse agent with metering pumps that directly feed into the water spray to avoid over-exposure of the cart from improper chemical/water distribution. The units shall be able to process a minimum of 10 carts per hour, with the following cycle requirements: o two-minute cycle, o 15-second detergent wash, o 15 second sanitizing rinse and o adjustable automotive car wash style drying. Carts will be dried with a blower utilizing a sheeting action. (in order to minimize any damage to doors and observation windows). The doors of the washers will be equipped with a safety bumper switch that will immediately open the door and disable the doors from closing if the door edge makes contact with any object during closure, (post safety activation requires reset at the control keypad). The doors shall be interlocked so that the unit will not be operational if any doors are open and to prevent both doors from being open at the same time unless the unit is out of service for maintenance. The floor of the unit shall be constructed of non-corrosive fiberglass, non skid material and allow for efficient and safe drainage of water as well as spillage of detergent and sanitizer. All mechanical components are to be located at floor level only and enclosed behind a removable panel.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

Cart washers must be engineered for low maintenance and ease of use. All parts/components (with the exception of the blower and key control) should be available off the shelf and be available in no more than 24 hours from time of diagnosis of defect. Cart washers should require no more than one staff member to operate each unit. The following options should be available for these units. ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Auxiliary heater Stack economizer Preventive maintenance ­ From Vendor in local area (1-3) times per year Automatic cart ejection Hand operated pressure washer

The cart washer units will be delivered, inspected and assembled, by certified factory technicians. (Due to the size constraints of the doors at the loading dock (approximately 4'w x 6'h) the units will need to come unassembled).

Installation should include the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Assembly of new equipment Duct work (as applicable) to the connection site Connection of all utilities (electric, water, steam, air) Testing of new equipment Training of staff on the operation of the cart washers

Utility Specifications Power requirements:
