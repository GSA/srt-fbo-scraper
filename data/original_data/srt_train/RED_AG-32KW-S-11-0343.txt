A. Project Overview & Background

In the mid 90’s, the Baseline Analysis System (BAS) economic model was developed with the purpose of systematically analyzing the spread and control of diseases of concern to APHIS Veterinary Services animal health programs. Since then, the BAS model has been used for a variety of applications. 



The BAS model is a complex computer-based economic model that has been in continuous development in APHIS through multiple versions for many years.  It is a multi-commodity, multi-country, static partial equilibrium economic welfare model.



Since the BAS model is complex and not user-friendly, a user interface and accompanying documentation were developed for the model in 2006. The purpose of the interface was to facilitate the use of the model by a broader range of APHIS analysts. The interface was programmed by Vose Consulting. The interface was programmed in Visual Basic for the Microsoft Excel 2003 platform which the BAS model was built within.



The development and integration of the interface with the model in 2006 was a substantial undertaking that included (1) creating input screens for model parameters, (2) allowing for multiple model scenario selections, (3) integrating model solving capability between Microsoft Excel and the model interface, and (4) creating numerical and graphical output screens and report writing capability. The integration of the model and interface required substantial interaction between the programmer and APHIS staff so the programmer could become familiar with the functionality of the BAS Economic Model.  This interaction between APHIS staff and the programmer continued through 21 different rounds of development and testing of both the interface and the model to ensure that the resulting integrated product reliably and repeatedly produced accurate economic output information.



In February of 2010, APHIS Veterinary Services migrated from Microsoft Excel 2003 to Microsoft Excel 2007. As a result of the migration the model interface no longer functioned with the version of Excel available to APHIS analysts.  



As of July, 2011, APHIS Veterinary Services is in the process of migrating from Microsoft Excel 2007 to Microsoft Excel 2010.



B. Project Scope & Measurable Objectives

The scope of this project is to update the original user interface of the BAS model so it functions with Microsoft Excel 2010 and is backwards compatible with prior versions of Excel back to Excel 2002. 









Measureable Objectives



The original functional requirements of the user interface are listed below and must be functional in the updated interface:



Users can select a particular scenario that the model is being used for via an opening control screen. In addition, from the first control screen, a general control screen opens in which (if space allows) all input parameters can be seen and changed.



Depending on the scenario selected, a second screen opens so that the user can give scenario-specific input. This screen consists of several tabbed sheets to make inputting data, navigating and reviewing of current data easy for the user. In the input screen, the value that was last used is shown.



After all appropriate data have been input into the model a new screen shows the relevant and scenario-specific results. Screen results are also available as output in an Excel file.



Users can select an option for multi-year scenarios in which data carries over to the next year and adjustment is automatic.



Informative warnings appear when data input is incomplete and flags indicate when of “out-of bound” values have been used.



Users can select from 1 to 6 production sub-groups (currently in the model) and manipulate each group independently.



The interface initiates a solver function within Microsoft Excel that equalizes prices between the domestic and foreign countries represented in the model.



Software and code developed under this contract becomes the property of the Federal Government.



C. Contractor Qualifications



The purpose of this project is to update to the prior programming work on the BAS model interface so it will work with multiple versions of Microsoft Excel. These multiple versions include the latest version, Excel 2010, as well as backward compatibility with all prior versions of Excel back to Excel 2002.  This work requires knowledge and skill with the existing model interface, Visual Basic (the programming language used for the interface), and with the functionality of the BAS economic model itself.  









D. Government Furnished Equipment



None.



E. Travel Costs



None, all communication between the programmer and APHIS staff will take place via conference calls, email, and internet.



F. Security Requirements



Contractor will not require physical on-site access to federally controlled facilities.

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:



1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.

400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:

    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;

    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;

    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or 

    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

 2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.  If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

 If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form

1444 (SF 1444)}

 Conformance Process:

 The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
