QUESTIONS Question Submittal Offerors may submit questions/clarifications in reference to any areas of the RFP. Questions/clarifications must be submitted via email to the contract specialist. Submitted questions/clarifications will not be accepted by any other means. Questions/clarifications must identify the section of the RFQ. Questions/clarifications will be answered in an amendment to the solicitation. Questions/clarifications will not be discussed over the phone. All questions/clarifications must be submitted by COB June 16, 2010. Questions submitted after this date will not be answered unless a deficiency is identified, which would compromise the quality of the proposals received in response to this solicitation. Contract Specialist: Ms. Jody Bester (jody.bester@usuhs.mil) EVALUATION FACTORS Award will be made to contractors representing the best value to the Government, using tradeoffs between the evaluation factors listed below. Tradeoffs allow the Government to select those contractors representing the best value to the Government by conducting a tradeoff between the evaluation factors. The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically rated offeror. Award will be made to the offeror whose offer is technically acceptable and whose Technical Expertise, Past Performance, and Price are the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. The Government may reject any proposal that has been determined to be unrealistic in terms of technical approach or price, when compared to the Government estimate, market research and other offerors. Proposals may also be rejected if the offeror does not display a clear understanding of the requirements or the terms and conditions, in their proposal. I. Technical Expertise: The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical expertise in the performance of the Tasks. Offerors will provide a technical proposal that documents the offerors approach to each component of the Task. II. Past Performance: The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance on similar tasks within the past three years. Offerors must provide a list of ten (10) relevant contracts within the past three (3) years. The Government reserves the right to select which references to contact. The following must be provided for each listed contract: i. Name of client and address

HU0001-10-T-0059 Page 8 of 33

ii. Name of current point of contact including telephone number , e-mail address and title iii. Contract number iv. Contract value v. Contract period of performance vi. Brief description of services provided Offerors may provide copies of recent past performance evaluations. USUHS may request additional information at any time. Three (3) completed past performance surveys must be submitted. The surveys must be submitted by the customer reference by the due date of proposals. The surveys must be emailed to the listed contract specialist. Past performance surveys included in the proposal, but not received directly from the customer reference will not be considered. When a subcontractor is proposed on a Task past performance surveys may be submitted for subcontractors. Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a Neutral/Unknown rating for past performance. Offerors must clearly state in their proposal if they do not have at least three (3) past performance references. Failure to provide this information will render an offeror's proposal non-responsive and will not be considered for award. Offerors may provide past performance surveys for subcontractors they have worked with on previous and/or current contracts; however the majority of the past performance surveys must be for the offeror. More than three (3) past performance surveys will be accepted. The following numeric ratings will be used to evaluate past performance on the past performance surveys: Numeric Rating 5 4 3 2 1 N/A

Definition Vendor has greatly exceeded the customer's expectat ion and has provided service in excess of the requirement. Vendor has exceeded the customer's expectation. Vendor has met the customer's expectation. Vendor has met the customer's expectation, with minimal problems. Vendor has not met the customer's expectation. Neutral/Unknown Confidence

A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance. The most weight will

HU0001-10-T-0059 Page 9 of 33

be given to relevant past performance in the area of support services provided to medical universities/institutions. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history. If offerors provide their email address in the Past Performance Survey, an email will be sent to the listed email address by USU that a Past Performance Survey was received and the name of the client submitting the survey. The Past Performance Survey is attached in the FBO Posting. III. Corporate Experience: Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their corporate experience in providing support in the following areas: Implementation of the task-specific software at institutions of higher education Configuration, modification and integration with Oracle 11 and MIT COEUS Deliverables: With a focus on the range of previous experience. Technical Support: With a focus on the qualifications of technical support team and how technical support is provided (emergency configuration changes, phone support, turn-around of questions, etc) Training: With a focus on the type(s) of training provided to customers. Offerors or subcontractors are required to have Corporate Experience in all areas identified. Offerors are required to provide resumes of key personnel in the following positions/capabilities: Project Manager(s) Personnel providing support for requirements analysis, configuration, modification or integration. Training (as appropriate for the task) Technical Support (as appropriate for the task) Offerors may provide resumes for additional positions the offeror feels are key to successful performance. Offerors must indicate whether resumes provided are current employees or possible future employees.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Established by Congress in 1972, matriculating in 1976 and graduating its first class in 1980, the university has a worldwide reputation as a center of excellence for military and public health professions education and research. Our programs are unique, related directly to force health protection, tropical diseases, disaster medicine, military and public health medical readiness and adaptation to extreme environments. USU prepares outstanding scientists and health care practitioners for careers in service to the nation. School of Medicine and Graduate School of Nursing The F. Edward HÃ©bert School of Medicine has a year-round, four-year curriculum that is nearly 700 hours longer than found at other U.S. medical schools. These extra hours focus on epidemiology, health promotion, disease prevention, tropical medicine, leadership and field exercises, and other subjects that relate to the unique requirements of career-oriented military and public health physicians. Of the 4,384 physician alumni, more than 75 percent currently serve on active duty in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and U.S. Public Health Service. Doctoral and masters degrees in the biomedical sciences and public health are awarded by interdisciplinary and department-based graduate programs within the School of Medicine. Program strengths include infectious disease, neuroscience, and preventive medicine research. A large number of graduates are military officers who serve the federal biomedical research enterprise. The Graduate School of Nursing offers a Master of Science in Nursing degree in Nurse Anesthesia, Family Nurse Practitioner, Perioperative Clinical Nursing, Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, and a full and part-time program for a Ph.D. degree in Nursing Science. The university's continuing education program is unique and extensive, serving and sustaining the professional and readiness requirements of the Defense Department's worldwide military health care community through on-site and distance education. Research The university's nationally ranked military and civilian faculty conduct cutting edge research in the biomedical sciences and in areas specific to the DOD health care mission such as combat casualty care, infectious diseases and radiation biology. The university is committed to technology transfer to ensure that the results of research are made widely available and currently holds more than 289 patents or pending patents. The Uniqueness of Military Medicine The university specializes in military and public health medicine which is more than practicing medicine in the military or Public Health Service, and differs significantly from civilian medicine. Military/Public Health medicine focuses on keeping the people healthy and especially in the military, involves disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment by medical personnel who are integral to the operations they support. Military physicians must understand and treat syndromes and injuries that are often rare or unknown among nonmilitary populations. Military medicine requires a solid background in tropical medicine and hygiene, parasitology, epidemiologic methods and preventive medicine. Knowledge in areas of military medical intelligence, the psychological stresses of combat and trauma, and the medical effects of extreme environments whether in tropical or desert conditions, aerospace or undersea, is essential to properly advising a military commander on how to best keep troops fit. For those in the Public Health Service, medical practice relies on much of the same expertise. In addition, the Public Health Service is growing in its capacity to provide health interventions during and following natural disasters and benefits from the same training and knowledge base as the other uniformed services. Simply put, the focus is practicing "good medicine in bad places." "Learning to care for those in harm's way."
