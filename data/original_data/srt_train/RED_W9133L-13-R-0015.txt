CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.203-5     COVENANT AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES (APR 1984)

(a) The Contractor warrants that no person or agency has been employed or retained to solicit or obtain this contract upon an agreement or
understanding for a contingent fee, except a bona fide employee or agency. For breach or violation of this warranty, the Government shall have
the right to annul this contract without liability or, in its discretion, to deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise
recover, the full amount of the contingent fee.

(b) "Bona fide agency," as used in this clause, means an established commercial or selling agency, maintained by a contractor for the purpose of
securing business, that neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government contracts nor holds itself out
as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.

"Bona fide employee," as used in this clause, means a person, employed by a contractor and subject to the contractor's supervision and control
as to time, place, and manner of performance, who neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government
contracts nor holds out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.

"Contingent fee," as used in this clause, means any commission, percentage, brokerage, or other fee that is contingent upon the success that a
person or concern has in securing a Government contract.

"Improper influence," as used in this clause, means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Government employee or officer to give
consideration or to act regarding a Government contract on any basis other than the merits of the matter.

(End of clause)


52.232-23     ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS (JAN 1986)

(a) The Contractor, under the Assignment of Claims Act, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15 (hereafter referred to as "the Act"), may
assign its rights to be paid amounts due or to become due as a result of the performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other
financing institution, including any Federal lending agency. The assignee under such an assignment may thereafter further assign or reassign its
right under the original assignment to any type of financing institution described in the preceding sentence.

(b) Any assignment or reassignment authorized under the Act and this clause shall cover all unpaid amounts payable under this contract, and
shall not be made to more than one party, except that an assignment or reassignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more
parties participating in the financing of this contract.

(c) The Contractor shall not furnish or disclose to any assignee under this contract any classified document (including this contract) or
information related to work under this contract until the Contracting Officer authorizes such action in writing.

(End of clause)



52.233-1     Disputes.  (JUL 2002)

(a) This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613).

(b) Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause.

(c) “Claim,” as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of
right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to
this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim
under the Act until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim
under the Act. The submission may be converted to a claim under the Act, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this
clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.

(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual
of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written
decision by the Contracting Officer.

(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding
$100,000.

(ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.

(iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and
complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor
believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor.”

(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.

(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within
60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify
the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.

(f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.

(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the
parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor
shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor’s specific reasons for rejecting the offer.

(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim
(certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to
claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially
receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is
applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as
fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim,
appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

                                                AIR NATIONAL GUARD MASS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM (MNS)
                                                        NET-CENTRIC ALERTING SYSTEM (NCAS)

1. Introduction:


   This Statement of Objectives describes the basic objectives of the Air National Guard(ANG) Net-Centric Alerting System (NCAS) and is provided
   in lieu of a Government written Statement of Work (SOW).  This approach provides potential offerors the flexibility to develop cost effective
   solutions and the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives meeting the stated objectives.  It also presents the Government with an
   opportunity to assess the offeror’s understanding of all aspects of the effort to be performed by eliminating the “how to” instructions to
   accomplish the required effort normally contained on the SOW the Government provides to prospective offerors.

2. Program Goal:

   The Air National Guard must be able to rapidly and reliably inform appropriate personnel about anti-terrorism/force protection conditions
   (FPCON) (including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats), hazardous weather conditions, and many other critical events
   through the use of NCAS.

3. Program Objectives

   A. The NCAS shall be capable of sending alert messages to end-users (recipients) via multiple delivery methods, including:
        a. Audio-visual network alerts to desktops and laptops via desktop pop-up
        b. Text alerts to mobile phones and pagers
        c. Text alerts to electronic mail (e-mail) clients
        d. Audio alerts to phones
        e. Audio alerts to existing indoor/outdoor PA/giant voice systems
        f. Network alerts to XMPP-based Chat rooms or any other IP-connected devices via standard XML and CAP protocols


   B. The NCAS shall be capable of sending alert messages to target recipients according to:
        a. Hierarchical organizational structure (as would be imported from an LDAP or Active Directory)
        b. Organizational roles
        c. Specific distribution lists (e.g., hazardous materials (HAZMAT) response teams)
        d. Dynamic groups created through on-the-fly queries of the user directory
        e. Geographical locations (e.g., entire bases, zones within bases)
        f. IP address

   C. The NCAS must be capable of interoperability with other notification systems and organizations hosting those systems, for example, but not
      limited to NOAA, FEMA and Army National Guard  through Common Access Protocol (CAP)


   D. The NCAS shall be able to centrally track, in real-time, all alerting activities for each individual recipient, including sending,
      receiving, and responding to alerts, and be able to generate reports based on tracked information


   E. The Air National Guard Enterprise Network (ANGEN) is comprised of VMware virtual server infrastructure; therefore any NCAS solution must
      leverage virtualization.
        a. Exclusion:  2 ANG Locations require NCAS be installed on existing physical servers

4. Considerations

   A. Acceptable proposals must include the ability to rapidly and reliably provide the NCAS program objectives to all users within the ANGEN to
      include main operating bases and geographically separated units.

        a. Exclusion: Host bases with tenant ANG organizations are responsible for providing NCAS to those ANG units within the host base area
           of responsibility



   B. Leveraging existing resources/capabilities to achieve program objectives could be included in the offeror’s proposal




   C. All aspects of the proposed solution (hardware/software) must:

        a. Comply with applicable DISA STIGS

        b. Have approval to connect to DOD networks

        c. Must meet DOD/AF certification and accreditation criteria

note that a separate cover sheet shall accompany your redacted proposal that contains your company’s contact information.  Offerors may propose
any code convention for any subcontractors; however, the Offerors must incorporate its own alphanumeric code (e.g. XXXX-01).

L.1.1     GENERAL

The offeror’s proposal shall be submitted in hard copy, with accompanying digital copies, as set forth below.

The offeror’s proposal shall consist of five (5) volumes. The Volumes are I – Mission Capability, II – Past Performance, III – Small Business
Participation, IV – Cost/Price, and V – Solicitation, Offer and Award Documents and Certifications/Representations. Files shall not contain
classified data. The use of hyperlinks in proposals is prohibited. An offeror's failure to provide in its proposal the information specified

respond to the solicitation.

All supporting data required for development of the proposal shall be included or summarized in each proposal within the stated page
limitations.  Offerors are cautioned that “parroting” of the Technical requirements or the SOO with a statement of intent to perform does not
reflect an understanding of the requirement or capability to perform. Offerors are responsible for including sufficient details to permit a
complete and accurate evaluation of each proposal.

Mere statements that the Offeror understands the requirements and can or will comply with the requirements without supporting information are
not acceptable and may be reason for determining a proposal to be unacceptable. Proprietary information shall be clearly marked.

      The following additional restrictions apply:

      b. File Packaging. All of the proposal files shall be compressed (zipped) into one file entitled proposal zip using WinZip version 6.2 or
later, or as separate uploads in their native format, i.e. doc, xls, ppt, etc., and provided on CDs or DVDs. Zip disks are not permitted. Files

      c. Content Requirement. All information shall be confined to the appropriate file. The offeror shall confine submissions to essential
matters, sufficient to define the proposal in a concise manner, to permit a complete and accurate evaluation of each proposal. Each file of the

the Offeror’s proposal, except for information the Government obtains to evaluate the Past Performance Factor. Proprietary information shall be
clearly marked. The following shall be included in the Narrative discussion:


      (i) VOLUME I – MISSION CAPABILITY

           Offerors shall submit all necessary information to permit evaluation of the factor in this volume.  No pricing information is to be
provided in the Mission Capability Volume. The volume shall be organized as follows:

            • Mission Capability Offerors shall describe recent similar experience at the corporate and service delivery level in demonstrating
              value relative to MNS/NCAS and in working with customer organizations to understand and meet their needs.  The proposal will

              period of performance and size of effort. The contracts identified shall demonstrate the organization’s performance or
              responsibility for performance of services similar to those described in the SOO.  Demonstration of experience in the ability to

              of the representative tasks, ANG Support tasks proposed for the technical solution, compliance with DoD IA standards, overall
              business approach, relevant management experience (including Mass Notification System/Net-Centric Alerting System) and identify
              the extent to which the management experience relates to the current requirement. Offerors will provide clear, definitive and

obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.  The absence of past performance data will be rated
neither favorably nor unfavorably.  Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors.  For
contractors with limited or no relevant corporate past performance, the three (3) current or previous contracts submitted may reflect
information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will
perform key aspects of the requirement.  The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance
Questionnaire (Attachment J-7). Offeror shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so

M.1   BASIS FOR FIRM FIXED PRICE AWARD

a) The award will be made based on the best overall (i.e., best value) proposal that are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government,
   with appropriate consideration given to the four (4) evaluation factors. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous
   to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and sub-factors described below.  The Government intends to
   determine best value by conducting a trade-off analysis of Price and Non-Price factors with respect to the relative order of importance
   described in paragraph M.3.

b) The following evaluation factors and sub-factors will be used to evaluate each proposal:

      Factor I – MISSION CAPABILITY

      Factor II - PAST PERFORMANCE

      Factor III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION

      Factor IV - PRICE

c) To receive consideration for award, an offer must receive no less than an “Acceptable” rating for the Mission Capability Factor.

d) Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offeror; or, if non-price factors are evaluated as
   comparatively equal between two or more offerors, price may become a determinative factor.

e) Evaluation of the offeror’s proposal shall address each factor as it applies to the Statement Of Objectives (SOO). A detailed explanation of
   the criteria for the evaluation is set forth in the “Evaluation Approach”, Paragraph M.4. of this section. During evaluations of each
   proposal, the Government will assign each factor an adjectival rating and write a narrative evaluation reflecting the identified findings.


M.2   BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD

a) The Source Selection Team (SST) will conduct an evaluation of all proposals.

b) A price analysis will be conducted comparing the prices proposed by the offerrors  only after other Factors are evaluated.

c) The Government intends to award the contract to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the
   following factors:

      Factor I – MISSION CAPABILITY

      Factor II – PAST PERFORMANCE

      Factor III – SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION

      Factor IV - PRICE

d) The contracting officer will conduct a separate tradeoff analysis using the ratings established by the process at M.2(a) and the price
   analysis at M.2(b) in order to determine contract awardee.


M.3   FACTORS AND THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE

a) RELATIVE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE TERMINOLOGY.  An evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria set forth below.
   Evaluation criteria consist of factors.  In order to provide the Offeror with an understanding of the significance assigned by the Government,
   the factors are assigned a relative order of importance.  The following terminology is used:

   1) Significantly More Important.  The factor is substantially more important than another factor.  The factor is given far more consideration
      than another factor.

   2) More Important.  The factor is greater in value than another factor, but not as much as a significantly more important factor.  The factor
      is given more consideration than another factor.

   3) Equal.  The factor is the same in value as another factor.

b) RELATIVE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS.

   1) Factor Order of Importance

     a) The Mission Capability Factor is More Important than the Past Performance Factor.

     b) The Mission Capability Factor is Significantly More Important than the Small Business Participation Factor.

     c) The Past Performance Factor is More Important than the Small Business Participation Factor.

     d) The Past Performance Factor and Small Business Participation Factor are each More Important than the Price Factor.

     e) All non-Price evaluation factors, when combined, are More Important than the Price Factor.


M.4   EVALUATION APPROACH

      All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by the Source Selection Team (SST).

      1. The overarching evaluation approach for all factors is as follows:

           a. Adequacy of Response. The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror’s methods and approach have adequately and
      completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the RFP. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent
      to which each requirement has been addressed in the proposal in accordance with the proposal submission section of the RFP.

           b. Feasibility of Approach. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the proposed approach is workable and the
      end results achievable. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which successful performance is contingent upon proven
      devices and techniques. The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror is expected to be able to successfully
      complete the proposed tasks and technical requirements within the required schedule.


M.5   EVALUATION CRITERIA


M.5.1 FACTOR I - MISSION CAPABILITY

   M.5.1.1   Overall Capability.

        1) Mission Capability The Government will evaluate the proposed review of the technical approach within the proposal, including, but not
           limited to the following elements: overall capability of proposed team, risk assessment of the Representative tasks – ANG Support
           Tasks proposed for the Technical solution, overall business approach, and compliance with DoD IA standards.



In order to provide the offeror with an understanding of the value assigned by the Government, the criteria is being included below.  The
evaluation methodology to be used is the Combined Technical/Risk Rating.  A single rating for the Mission Capability Factor will be assigned
which includes consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies.  From the single ratings, an overall
Mission Capability Factor rating will be determined.



The following adjectival rating scale will be used to evaluate Factor I – Mission Capability and Factor III – Small Business Participation.

|              |                           |unsuccessful performance is low.                                                      |

M.5.2 FACTOR II - PAST PERFORMANCE

The Government will evaluate an Offeror’s record of past and current performance to ascertain the probability of successfully performing the
required efforts of the SOO.

The Government will provide a past performance confidence assessment  based on the recency and relevancy  of the Offeror’s past performance, as
well as that of its major subcontractors, if applicable.  The source of information regarding past performance, the context of the data, and
general trends in performance may also be considered.  The Government will focus its inquiry on the quality of the Offeror’s past performance
for any recent and relevant efforts by determining how well the contractor performed on those contracts.

The Government will use the adjectival ratings below to assess the relevancy of each contract reference:

After reviewing all recent and relevant past performance references, assessing the Offeror’s quality of performance under those references, and
considering all other sources of past performance data, the Government will use the adjectival ratings below to provide an overall past
performance confidence assessment rating:

|Performance Confidence Assessments                                                                                                      |
|Rating                                    |Definition                                                                                   |
|Substantial Confidence                    |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high         |
|                                          |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                  |
|Satisfactory Confidence                   |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable   |
|                                          |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                  |
|Limited Confidence                        |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low          |
|                                          |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                  |
|No Confidence                             |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation |
|                                          |that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                   |
|Unknown Confidence (Neutral)              |No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror’s performance record is so |
|                                          |sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.           |


M.5.3 FACTOR III - SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION

All offerors will be evaluated on the level of small business commitment demonstrated for the proposed acquisition, and their level of
commitment to utilizing small businesses in performance of prior contracts. The following shall demonstrate evidence of small business
participation:

   a)  The extent to which such firms, as defined in FAR Part 19, are specifically identified in proposals;

   b)  The extent of commitment to use such firms (signed commitments will be weighted more heavily);

   c) The complexity and variety of the work small firms are to perform;

   d) The realism of the proposal;

   e) Past performance of the offeror in complying with the requirements of the clauses at FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns;

   f) The extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value of the total acquisition to include SDB dollars by NAICS code deemed
      applicable by the offeror;

   g)  The extent to which the offeror provides detailed explanations/documentation supporting the proposed participation percentages, or lack
thereof.  The minimum subcontracting goals for this procurement are a percentage of the total contract value listed.

      Small Disadvantaged Business: 10.5%,

      Hub-Zone: 3.5%,

      Women Owned Small Business: 5%,

      Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 3.25%,

      Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions 0%

      Veteran Owned Small Business:  5 %

 (NOTE:  Because SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, SDVOSB, and VOSB are sub-categories of small business, a firm can be counted in more than one category.
For example, if a participation plan reflects 5% of the contract value for a Woman-Owned Small Business, the WOSB would also count towards the
overall Small Business Goal).


M.5.5 FACTOR IV - PRICE

The Government will evaluate an Offeror’s Total Contract Life Price (TCLP) to include the price for the base period, each option period, if
applicable, and the 52.217-8 period if used after all 52.217-9 options have been exercised (1/2 of the total of the final year), if applicable.
The Total Contract Life Price will be evaluated for completeness, accuracy, reasonableness and realism, using the techniques in FAR 15.404-
1(b)(2).  A determination will be made as to whether the Offerors have completed all aspects of the price proposal properly and whether the
amounts listed in the price proposal are calculated accurately.  No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.

1) The RFP requires firm-fixed-prices contract line items. A price reasonableness approach will be utilized by the Government to determine that
   the proposed prices offered are fair and reasonable and that a “buy-in” or unbalanced pricing between CLINs or Option Periods is not
   occurring. In evaluating price reasonableness, other than cost and pricing data, may be requested and utilized if the Contracting Officer
   cannot determine reasonableness through initially submitted pricing information. Indications of potential underbidding or unbalanced pricing
   will be reflected in the cost/pricing report and may impact the ratings for non-price factors as such indications may be determined to
   indicate a lack of understanding of the requirement.

2) The Government will examine price proposals for artificially low unit prices. Offers found to be unreasonably high, unrealistically low (an
   indication of “buy –in”), or unbalanced, may be considered unacceptable and may be rejected on that basis.

3) Evaluation of Options.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.

M.6 AWARD

Until a formal notice of award is issued, no communication by the Government, either written or oral, shall be interpreted as a promise that an
award will be made.  No cost chargeable to the prospective contract can be incurred before receipt of a fully executed contract or other
specific written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

52.212-4      CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS-- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2012)

(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The
Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require
repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If
repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or
adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights (1) within
a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition
of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

(b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a
bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31
U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not
assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.

(c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.

(d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this

a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor
shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.

(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

(f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control
of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign
or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers.
The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement or any excusable
delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch and shall promptly
give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.

(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.

(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have

Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic
Funds Transfer--Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.

(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

(2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment
regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

(h) Patent indemnity. The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs,
for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or
copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same
due date as the original demand for payment.

(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against
the contract debt; or

(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.

(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.

(j) Risk of loss. Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract shall

convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all
of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the
contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor
shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give
the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which
reasonably could have been avoided.

(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the
Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with
adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any
amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided
by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination
for convenience.

(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon
acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.

(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose
described in this contract.

(p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for
consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items.

(q) Other compliances. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations
applicable to its performance under this contract.

of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.,
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act; 41 U.S.C. 51-58, Anti-Kickback Act of 1986; 41 U.S.C. 265 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to

(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1)

and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting
from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the
Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in
the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this
contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract),
or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-
name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written
notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in
writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification
sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the
Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph
of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR
database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through
https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the
Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination unless
extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.

(m)(1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by the
Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed the
amount to which the Contractor will be entitled.

together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be
computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by the Contractor to the date the excess is repaid. Interest shall not be
charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or other disposition
of termination inventory until 10 days after the date of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the Contracting Officer
because of the circumstances.

(n) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the Contractor shall maintain all records and documents relating to the terminated
portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Contractor's costs and
