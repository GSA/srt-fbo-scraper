SECTION C -- DESCRIPTIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS C.1 GENERAL

C.1.1 BACKGROUND The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is the principal advisor to the Under Secretary and Director on the application of information technology (IT) to support and improve the USPTO's business processes. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) directs the development, implementation, maintenance, enhancement and operation of the USPTO's Automated Information Systems (AIS) and the development of supporting Strategic and Operational IT plans (SITP and OITP), operates the USPTO's computer facilities, equipment and telecommunications network, and develops, maintains, and disseminates patent and trademark information to the public. The CIO serves as the USPTO's Senior Information Resources Management (IRM) Official and provides executive leadership and administrative and policy direction to the organization with particular emphasis on the components responsible for strategic, programmatic, and IT governance affairs. The USPTO embraces the President's Open Government Initiative (OGI) to provide increased transparency of government operations and information by making bulk data available directly to the public for no charge. Recent efforts have focused on making virtually all publicly available patent and trademark bulk information from the USPTO accessible on the Internet. Datasets, estimated to be nearly eighty (80) terabytes (in raw form; includes some duplicates) and maintained by the USPTO include:       Patent Grants and Patent Application Publications, in both text and image formats; Trademark application, registration and Trademark Trial and Appeal Board data, in both text and image formats; Assignment data for both Patent and Trademark applications; Fee Data associated with patent applications; Patent Classification data; and Status data for published patent applications (Published Patent Application Data / Transaction History / Patent Term Adjustment / Patent Term Extension Foreign Priority / Attorney Address / Continuity Data / Published Documents / Image File Wrapper and associated meta data).

Not all of this information is currently available in bulk or machine-readable format, nor are the data formats consistent across datasets. In addition, USPTO does not have the technical capability to unconditionally distribute the data. Further, the USPTO does not have the financial resources to rectify these limitations. C.1.2 OBJECTIVE The USPTO OCIO seeks to meet the President's Open Government Initiative to provide increased transparency of Government operations and information by making more 3

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

patent and trademark bulk data in machine-readable format available to the public via the Internet. The USPTO OCIO seeks an interested party (henceforth referred to as Contractor) capable of acquiring patent and trademark bulk data and providing such data to the public at no cost to the USPTO or the public. The Contractor shall crawl the USPTO's Public PAIR (Patent Application Information Retrieval) system and compile patent application status data in bulk, electronic form. The USPTO will define XML Schemas, Style sheets, data dictionary, containers, components and all artifacts necessary to define the data for the purposes of dissemination. The Contractor shall host, and provide to the public free of charge, bulk datasets provided by the USPTO and the Public PAIR bulk dataset compiled by the Contractor. The USPTO may define and provide additional datasets as they become available. Section C.3 (Requirements) lists datasets covered by this contract. C.1.3 DATA DISSEMINATION The USPTO envisions a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship with the Contractor whereby patent and trademark bulk data is made easily accessible and at no cost to the public. Through this contract, the USPTO will be able to fulfill Open Government and transparency obligations and in exchange, the Contractor shall receive the opportunity to retrieve, enhance, and distribute USPTO patent and trademark bulk data. The data received by the Contractor shall be distributed in a USPTO defined format. Dataset enhancement of the free, publicly available data is not a requirement of this contract. However, the Contractor may choose to broaden the datasets and potentially gather a fee. Therefore, the Contractor is allowed to repackage (enhance), distribute, and sell any resulting enhanced data and retain any fees that are collected from such sales. The USPTO shall enter into a no cost contract where the Contractor shall: 1. Crawl the USPTO's Public PAIR system and compile patent application status data in bulk, electronic form. The USPTO will define XML Schemas, Style sheets, data dictionary, containers, components and all artifacts necessary to define the data for the purposes of dissemination. 2. Host, and provide to the public free of charge, bulk datasets provided by the USPTO and the Public PAIR bulk dataset compiled by the Contractor. 3. Determine, in conjunction with the USPTO, the categorization and standardization of the data with an emphasis on compactness and speed of transmission. The Contractor must be capable of providing the retrieval and distribution of patent and trademark bulk data in essentially unaltered form, modified only as necessary to organize or compress the data for ease of distribution or for security purposes, from the USPTO to the public at no cost to 4

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

the USPTO or to the public. 4. Devise a method to provide distribution of updated or changed data. Frequency can be daily, weekly, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly and/or annually. Data dissemination is a continuous system and the Contractor shall continuously monitor the datasets and shall retrieve and host updates and changes as they go forward. 5. Use a secure infrastructure, housed external to the USPTO, that performs Public PAIR crawling and all dissemination of data to the public at no cost to the public or the USPTO. Such infrastructure may be distributed. 6. As part of this agreement, the Contractor is granted the right to maintain, repackage (enhance or add value), distribute, and sell any resulting enhanced datasets and retain any fees collected therefrom. The data must first be made available to the public in an unaltered form at no charge to the public or the USPTO. 7. As a result of any award, any repackaging, value added content, or enhancements to the Licensed Content (see definition below) created by the Contractor shall not be considered to be official USPTO Licensed Content and the USPTO is neither responsible nor liable for the accuracy of such repackaged, value added, or enhanced products. 8. Provide usage statistics indicating the progress of Public PAIR dataset creation and hosting and the volume of public downloading for each dataset. C.2 DEFINITIONS

1. "Licensed Content" means the content provided by USPTO to Contractor or

retrieved by Contractor pursuant to the delivery mechanism described.
2. "Distribution Partner" means a third party under an agreement with Contractor to

use Contractor products or services internally or provide or display Contractor products or services to end users.
3. "Confidential Information" is information disclosed by one party to the other party

under this agreement that is marked as confidential or would normally under the circumstances be considered confidential information of the disclosing party. Confidential Information does not include information that the recipient has in its possession, and that becomes public through no fault of the recipient, that was independently developed by the recipient, or that was rightfully given to the recipient by another party.
4. "Unauthorized activity" means an activity that is performed contrary to the terms of

this agreement or any applicable Federal or state law, rule or regulation. 5

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

5. "Compromised" means that the data has been altered such that it cannot be relied

upon as accurate or that a USPTO system has been accessed in a means that threatens the security of such data. C.3 REQUIREMENTS

C.3.1 Data dissemination shall be free to the public and at no cost to the USPTO. C.3.2 Creation of Public PAIR Dataset Public PAIR data is currently not available in Bulk. Creation of this dataset requires crawling the USPTO's Public PAIR website in order to extract, compact, format and compile data to be disseminated to the Public at no cost to the USPTO or the Public. The bulleted list below provides the names of specific Public PAIR tabs or data that must be crawled and compiled by the Contractor.  Public Patent Application Information Retrieval (Public PAIR)  Application Data  Transaction History  Patent Term Adjustments  Patent Term Extension  Image File Wrapper  Continuity Data  Foreign Priority  Supplemental Content  Address & Attorney/Agent

There may be additional tabs added to this list. The publication of PAIR data is anticipated to be daily for both USPTO and the Contractor. C.3.2.1 The Contractor shall consider the following when Crawling Public PAIR and creating Public PAIR bulk data: 1. Contractor shall not negatively impact the normal business activities of the USPTO. USPTO will provide a daily four (4) hour window of time for crawling activities and will facilitate crawling activities, such as by removing for the Contractor the reCaptcha data mining filter. 2. Under the specific direction of the USPTO, provide data cleanup where necessary, including but not limited to the identification and correction of data, elimination of duplicates and the correction of inconsistent data (data in multiple places that should agree, but does not agree.) 6

(a) Definitions. "Contracting Officer," as used in this clause, does not include any representative of the Contracting Officer. "Specifically Authorized Representative (SAR)," as used in this clause, means any person the Contracting Officer has so designated by written notice (a copy of which shall be provided to the Contractor) which shall refer to this paragraph and shall be issued to the designated representative before the SAR exercises such authority. (b) Notice. The primary purpose of this clause is to obtain prompt reporting of Government conduct that the Contractor considers to constitute a change to this contract. Except for changes identified as such in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall notify the Administrative Contracting Officer in writing promptly, within ______ (to be negotiated) calendar days from the date that the Contractor identifies any Government conduct (including actions, inactions, and written or oral communications) that the Contractor regards as a change to the contract terms and 24

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

conditions. On the basis of the most accurate information available to the Contractor, the notice shall state-- (5) The particular elements of contract performance for which the Contractor may seek an equitable adjustment under this clause, including-- a. What contract line items have been or may be affected by the alleged change; b. What labor or materials or both have been or may be added, deleted, or wasted by the alleged change; c. To the extent practicable, what delay and disruption in the manner and sequence of performance and effect on continued performance have been or may be caused by the alleged change; d. What adjustments to contract price, delivery schedule, and other provisions affected by the alleged change are estimated; and (6) The Contractor's estimate of the time by which the Government must respond to the Contractor's notice to minimize cost, delay or disruption of performance.

(c) Continued performance. Following submission of the notice required by paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor shall diligently continue performance of this contract to the maximum extent possible in accordance with its terms and conditions as construed by the Contractor, unless the notice reports a direction of the Contracting Officer or a communication from a SAR of the Contracting Officer, in either of which events the Contractor shall continue performance; provided, however, that if the Contractor regards the direction or communication as a change as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, notice shall be given in the manner provided. All directions, communications, interpretations, orders and similar actions of the SAR shall be reduced to writing promptly and copies furnished to the Contractor and to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall promptly countermand any action which exceeds the authority of the SAR. (d) Government response. The Contracting Officer shall promptly, within (to be negotiated) calendar days after receipt of notice, respond to the notice in writing. In responding, the Contracting Officer shall either--

25

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

(1)

Confirm that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice constitutes a change and when necessary direct the mode of further performance;

(2) Countermand any communication regarded as a change; (1) (2) The date, nature, and circumstances of the conduct regarded as a change; The name, function, and activity of each Government individual and Contractor official or employee involved in or knowledgeable about such conduct; The identification of any documents and the substance of any oral communication involved in such conduct;

(3)

In the instance of alleged acceleration of scheduled performance or delivery, the basis upon which it arose; (e) Equitable adjustments. (1) If the Contracting Officer confirms that Government conduct effected a change as alleged by the Contractor, and the conduct causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether changed or not changed by such conduct, an equitable adjustment shall be made-- a. In the contract price or delivery schedule or both; and b. In such other provisions of the contract as may be affected. (2) The contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. In the case of drawings, designs or specifications which are defective and for which the Government is responsible, the equitable adjustment shall include the cost and time extension for delay reasonably incurred by the Contractor in attempting to comply with the defective drawings, designs or specifications before the Contractor identified, or reasonably should have identified, such defect. When the cost of property made obsolete or excess as a result of a change confirmed by the Contracting Officer under this clause is included in the equitable adjustment, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of disposition of the property. The equitable adjustment shall not include increased costs or time extensions for delay resulting from the Contractor's failure to provide 26

(End of Clause) I.8 PTO-10 Agency-Level Protest Procedures 05/18/2007

AGENCY-LEVEL PROTEST PROCEDURES LEVEL ABOVE THE CONTRACTING OFFICER (DEC 1996) I. PURPOSE: To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12979, which directs heads of executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for resolving protests to awards of procurement contracts within their agencies at a level above the Contracting Officer. Authority to administer procurement-related directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Management (Procurement Executive). The Department's goal is to encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build confidence in the Government's acquisition system, and reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and other external forums. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party at the Contracting Officer level through open and frank discussions. If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency at a level above the Contracting Officer. II. DEFINITIONS: An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority but not both. When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the guidelines set forth in these established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102. A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Department is open. III. PROCEDURES: a. Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final decision for the Department. Protests shall be addressed to: Protest Decision Authority U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 29

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency-level Protest". The protester shall also provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the responsible contracting officer and a copy to the addressee indicated below: Office of the General Counsel General Law Office U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 (FAX Number 571-273-0099) b. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the protester agrees not to protest to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or any other external forums. If the protester has already filed with the GAO or other external forums, the procedures described here may not be used. 1. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or time set for receipt of proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests must be filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester was given the opportunity to be debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two sentences, protests shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. 2. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered filed until all information is provided. 3. To be complete, protests must contain the following information: (i) The protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number (ii) The solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer (iii) A detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced (iv) Copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statement (v) A request for ruling by the agency (vi) Statement as to form of relief requested (vii) All information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest (viii) All information establishing the timeliness of the protest All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the Contracting Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the issues raised by the protester and addresses any other issues, which, even if not raised by the protester, have been identified by agency officials as being relevant to the fairness of the procurement process. For good cause shown, the 30

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

protest decision authority may grant an extension of time for filing the administrative report and for issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will notify the protester and all interested parties within 1 day of the decision to grant the extension. Unless an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest decision authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of Commerce and not subject to further appeals. The protest decision authority shall send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by certified mail, return receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting office and Office of Acquisition Management. c. Effect of protest on award and performance: When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that: (i) The supplies or services are urgently required, (ii) Delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly, or (iii) A prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government. When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.506, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer shall immediately suspend performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including any review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance is justified. The HCA may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that: (i) Contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or (ii) urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision. IV. REMEDIES: The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies: (1) terminate the contract, (2) re -compete the requirement, (3) issue a new solicitation, (4) refrain from exercising options under the contract, (5) award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations, (6) amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue with the procurement, (7) such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to correct a defect.

b.

1. Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-- [a] If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or [b] There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or [c] It is the only proposal received. 2. However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

c. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. d. If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. e. Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity 43

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) (5) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-- (1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of--or in connection with--the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: 44

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

(3)

(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from technical/ experience and price standpoint. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be 45

(6)

(7)

(8)

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

(9)

rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.

(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: a. The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. b. The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. c. The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. d. A summary of the rationale for award. e. For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. f. Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. L.3 52.216-1 Type of Contract (JULY 1995)

The Government plans to award a no-cost contract resulting from this solicitation.

52.233-2 Service of Protests (DEVIATION FAR 52.233-2) (SEPT 2006)

A. Protests, as defined in Section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the General

46

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from: U.S. Dept. of Commerce, USPTO Office of Procurement Attn: V'Anne Tugbang P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 B. The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO. AGENCY-LEVEL PROTEST PROCEDURES LEVEL ABOVE THE CONTRACTING OFFICER (DEC 1996)

I. PURPOSE: To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12979, which directs heads of executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for resolving protests to awards of procurement contracts within their agencies at a level above the Contracting Officer. Authority to administer procurement-related directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Management (Procurement Executive). The Department's goal is to encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build confidence in the Government's acquisition system, and reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and other external fora. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party at the Contracting Officer level through open and frank discussions. If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency at a level above the Contracting Officer. II. DEFINITIONS: An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority but not both. When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the guidelines set forth in these established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102. A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of the Department of

47

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

Commerce are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Department is open. III. PROCEDURES: a. Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final decision for the Department. Protests shall be addressed to: Bill Weinberg Director, Office of Procurement U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 (FAX Number 571-273-6575) The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agencylevel Protest". The protester shall also provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the responsible contracting officer and a copy to the addressee indicated below: Office of the General Counsel General Law Office U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 (FAX Number 571-273-0099) b. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the protester agrees not to protest to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or any other external forums. If the protester has already filed with the GAO or other external forums, the procedures described here may not be used. 1. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or time set for receipt of proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests must be filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester was given the opportunity to be debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two sentences, protests shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. 2. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered filed until all information is provided. 3. To be complete, protests must contain the following information: (i) the protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number 48

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

(ii) the solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer (iii) a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced (iv) copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statement (v) a request for ruling by the agency (vi) statement as to form of relief requested (vii) all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest (viii) all information establishing the timeliness of the protest All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the Contracting Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the issues raised by the protester and addresses any other issues, which, even if not raised by the protester, have been identified by agency officials as being relevant to the fairness of the procurement process. For good cause shown, the protest decision authority may grant an extension of time for filing the administrative report and for issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will notify the protester and all interested parties within I day of the decision to grant the extension. Unless an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest decision authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of Commerce and not subject to further appeals. The protest decision authority shall send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by certified mail, return receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting office and Office of Acquisition Management. c. Effect of protest on award and performance: When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that: (i) The supplies or services are urgently required, (ii) delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly, or (iii) a prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government. When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.506, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer shall immediately suspend performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including any review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance is justified. The HCA may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that: (i) contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or (ii) urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision. IV. REMEDIES:

49

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies: (1) terminate the contract, (2) re -compete the requirement, (3) issue a new solicitation,(4) refrain from exercising options under the contract, (5) award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations, (6) amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue with the procurement, (7) such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to correct a defect.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award M.1 Evaluation of Proposals a. Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria listed below. The objective of the evaluation is to determine which proposal offers the best prospect for attainment of the objectives of the solicitation. Those proposals found to be technically unacceptable and not reasonably subject to being made acceptable will be eliminated from further consideration. b. A major item and/or gross omission which precludes meeting program objectives which cannot be corrected prior to or during negotiations without major revision or complete resubmission of the proposal will cause a proposal to be found technically unacceptable. c. Those offerors whose proposal evaluations indicate that they do not have a reasonable chance of being awarded the contract will be excluded from the competitive range. M.2 Minimum Response Requirements To be considered acceptable and eligible for award, an offeror must address separately all the factors set forth in accordance with Section L of this solicitation. M.3 Evaluation of Individual Proposals Award of the no-cost contract will be made to the firm offering the best technical offer. Contractors will be evaluated based on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance. M.3.1 Experience Approach Factor FACTOR 1: EXPERIENCE The USPTO will evaluate relevant experience, special training, and special skills in handling large scale data, along with learning existing systems, designing databases, extracting data, writing software, integrating new systems into existing systems, testing and to provide services to the general public. M.3.2 Technical Approach Factor FACTOR 2: TECHNICAL APPROACH The technical approach will be evaluated based on the contractor's proposed methodology and ability to demonstrate an understanding of the technical requirements set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW). The contractor's proposed technical approach will be evaluated on how effectively its proposal demonstrates achievement of the objectives and for successful performance of all requirements. The technical approach will also be evaluated on the 53

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

contractor's ability to provide resources with expertise in the following: Database, Network, Hardware, Software, Facility and Program Management.1 The USPTO will evaluate the contractor's proposed System Architecture with regards to design, adherence to standards, flexibility to upgrade, migrate, append, enhance, and integration into future systems and technologies. The USPTO will evaluate the contractor's ability to provide field services and technical assistance including helpdesk, hours of operation of helpdesk or customer service and technical support to handle large scale data that provides service to the general public. M.3.3 Past Performance Factor

Vendors will be evaluated on the relevance and quality of past performance and experience of the vendors as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of work in accordance with the RFP. FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE Evaluation of past performance will be based on relevant information presented in the offeror's proposal (including past performance questionnaire(s)) and information obtained by contacting the offeror's supplied references. The offeror shall provide at least three (3) references to include specific points of contact and e-mail addresses for those contacts. In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via the offeror's supplied references and federal sources to include the Past Performance Information Retrieval Systems and the Excluded Parties List System. Past performance information shall pertain to performance on work that is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the SOW requirements of this solicitation and include demonstrating the offorer's ability to: host terabytes worth of data and allow thousands of user hits per day. In determining whether past performance information is relevant or not relevant, consideration will be given to contracts of same or similar project complexity, scope, and type. If past performance information is either not relevant or not available, then the offeror will be rated neutral (neither favorably nor unfavorably). Notes: *The USPTO reserves the right to determine which contracts submitted by the offeror is relevant to the requirements and to utilize only those references. *In the conduct of its past performance evaluation of offerors, the USPTO may use a variety of information sources in addition to information provided by the offeror. These sources may include, but are not limited to, technical reports, commercial or any available published information, and information derived from present or past Government or commercial customers

Program Management. The offeror's approach to the planning and control of resources will be evaluated including: management controls to provide early visibility for schedule problems, defining the contract work, assigning responsibility, and providing appropriate detailed schedule data to management and the government.

54

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

of the offeror. The USPTO may use past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror. Those offerors who have no relevant past performance history will not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance. *By providing the USPTO the above contacts, the offeror is certifying that it has contacted the referenced individuals and given permission for the USPTO to contact said individuals. In the event that USPTO cannot contact the referenced individuals within a reasonable time frame, the past performance reference may not be considered. All contracts cited above will be considered to be potential references and may be contacted by the Government for a past performance evaluation/rating. Offerors shall insure that the individual listed for each contract as having day-to-day contract administration responsibility has been notified that the USPTO may contact them and has been authorized to respond to such inquiry. An inability to reach by phone the cited contact for contract administration may result in that project experience being excluded from the proposal evaluation. Relative Order of Importance: The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance. The Government will perform concurrent but separate evaluations of each part of the proposal. All parts (Experience, Technical Approach and Past Performance) of each proposal will be reviewed and analyzed. The USPTO may evaluate proposals without discussions. The USPTO reserves the right to hold oral presentations, if deemed necessary to determine best value. Should the Government chose to do so, oral presentations will be held with those offerors determined to be in the competitive range. Oral presentation instructions, if applicable and necessary, will be shared with those offerors in the competitive range. M.4 Award Determination The Government will evaluate all offerors' proposals to identify and rank those proposals that offer the greatest technical offer to the Government. Award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those criteria offering the best overall offer to the Government. M.5 Responsibility An offeror must be determined responsible according to the standards set forth in FAR 9.1 to be eligible for award. M.6 Evaluation of Options (FAR 52.217-5) (OCT 2004)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price 55

United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Request for Proposal (RFP) Number: DOC50PAPT1300005 Public Dissemination of Data

for all optons to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
