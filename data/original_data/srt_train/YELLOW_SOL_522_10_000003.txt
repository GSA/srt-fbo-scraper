SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK C.1 BACKGROUND

Health Conditions and Constraints of the Health System in Honduras Despite the fact that over the last 30 years Honduras has made significant progress in many key areas, the country continues to face serious challenges to its prospects for sustainable, long-term development. In the health sector, access to services remains a serious problem; almost 25% of the Honduran population experiences limited access to services provided through the national health system. Centralized decision-making, ineffective administration and endemic corruption limit Honduras's capacity to effectively respond to the health needs of the population. Although a certain level of de-concentration and decentralization has taken place in the MOH, critical functions such as budget allocation, hiring of personnel, and procurement and distribution of medicines are still directly controlled at the MOH central level. Although they have declined substantially, fertility, maternal mortality, infant mortality, and malnutrition rates remain high, with average figures masking serious health problems among the rural poor, many of whom are out-of-reach of the formal health system. Of particular concern is that maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth are still very high at 108 per 100,000 live births, with 51 percent of these deaths occurring outside of clinic or hospital settings. The 2006 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) results show that neonatal death rates are much higher compared to findings in previous surveys. The total fertility rate is 2.6 in urban areas, but much higher at 4.1 in rural areas. Continued high levels of preventable infant and child illness, complicated by high rates of chronic malnutrition and anemia, are especially serious in rural areas. The major challenges in the health sector are (1) to reach the populations who currently have inadequate access to health services and (2) to ensure that this increased access is sustained. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that people of the poorest quintile are paying more for health care than those with higher incomes. The health system, in both the public and private sectors, lacks the ability to offer services to these underserved populations with the needed quantity, quality and costefficiency. Even in family planning where delivery systems are better developed, the government's ability to sustain services once USAID funding has phased out in 2013 remains in question. In order for Honduras to further improve its overall health status, it must reach out to specific population groups who are currently underserved and whose health status is far worse than national averages suggest. These underserved and vulnerable populations include: rural poor whose communities are not served by MOH facilities; people who encounter access barriers to health services because of poverty, stigma, gender, age, or ethnicity; and people whose behavior puts them at increased risk. To improve the health conditions among these hard-to-reach populations, quality, usage, and financing of critical health services must be improved. This includes services that are delivered and organized at the community level. In addition to the Government of Honduras's (GOH) responsibilities in assuring access to a basic package of health services, community participation is a critical factor in improving health status at the community level, especially as it relates to preventing disease and promoting health. It is important, however, that community participation goes beyond

11

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

traditional consultation to enable citizens to be an active part of the decision making and actual implementation of services related to their health status. 1 Finally, gender dynamics have a direct impact on health status; existing inequities between men and women affect both access to quality health services and participation in community processes. Programs should address power imbalances between men and women that affect relative abilities to seek needed health services and to make informed decisions related to healthy behaviors. US Government Assistance in Honduras While the vast majority of the activities under this contract will fall under the Mission's new Assistance Agreement with the GOH, approximately the first quarter of activities will be funded under the current strategy "Investing in People: Healthier and Better Educated People ("Health Activity") Strategic Objective Grant Agreement (522-0433). Please see attached Results Framework for the current "Health Activity 522-0433". Under USAID/Honduras's new Results Framework for 2009-2013, Assistance Objective Four (AO 4) is "health status for underserved and vulnerable populations improved". AO 4 is supported by four Intermediate Results (IRs): IR 4.1: Use of MCH and FP Services Increased; IR 4.2: MCH and FP Services Sustained; IR 4.3: Use of Quality HIV and AIDS Services Expanded; and IR 4.4: Data Used for Decision-Making (see results framework in section E). Under its new Assistance Agreement with the GOH, USAID/Honduras will support the MOH's reform efforts in order to achieve the IRs necessary to improve health status for underserved populations: (1) increased use of quality maternal and child health and family planning services; and (2) sustained affordable and equitably financed maternal and child health and family planning services. A complimentary IR is "use of data for decision-making", which will ensure that the MOH policies are updated and implemented based on sound evidence and analysis. These IRs are national in scope because they address system-wide policy and technical issues, yet they are explicitly focused on improving health status in poor and underserved rural areas. In meeting AO 4 and related IRs, USAID provides support through a variety of technical assistance mechanisms integrated under the results framework to: (1) develop local capabilities to manage and deliver quality health services in a decentralized environment; (2) change the structure and function of the MOH to finance, regulate and evaluate - rather than directly provide - services for the poor; and (3) strengthen national health surveillance and program monitoring and evaluation systems to increase MOH and local capability to monitor and evaluate health programs. C.2 OBJECTIVE

USAID shall provide support to the GOH in order to strengthen the health system to improve efficiency, quality, equity and impact of health interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to provide technical support to the MOH, IHSS, Honduran Family Planning Association

(ASHONPLAFA) and other partners to (1) improve quality of and access to sustained FP and MCH services and (2) to improve the national health system through health sector reform and decentralization of health services to further impact maternal/reproductive health and neonatal/child health, as detailed in this section. The assistance mechanism contracted to provide the technical support described above is Unidad Local de Apoyo Técnico/USAID (ULAT/USAID). The Contractor shall be monitored and evaluated in its ability to transfer/develop capacities within the MOH to deliver MCH and FP services through decentralization and by strengthening the MOH steering role. The following results shall be achieved by the GOH with the support of the ULAT/USAID: IR 4.1: Use of MCH and FP Services Increased IR 4.1.1: Access to family planning and obstetric/neonatal essential care services improved IR 4:2: MCH and FP Services Sustained IR 4.2.1: Health system reformed to provide quality MCH and FP services IR 4.2.2: Permanent availability of contraceptive methods and supplies assured IR 4.4: Data Used for Decision-Making C.3 STATEMENT OF WORK

This contract shall build capacity in the GOH in the areas of health systems strengthening and service delivery, including providing support for the implementation of health care and financing models and the reorganization of MOH structures at national and departmental levels. In order to further improve the quality of and access to sustainable services, assistance shall include interventions to improve data-based decision making for maternal and child and reproductive health. All activities under this contract must be planned and implemented according to MOH approved policies, plans, strategies, norms, protocols and guidelines. In addition, all activities under this contract must be planned to complement the activities carried out by the MOH with USAID funding provided through the MOH's Unidad de Extensión de Cobertura y Financiamiento (UECF) and/or other such MOH units that fulfill similar administrative functions. The assistance provided under this contract will foster the GOH ownership and involvement in the activities and interventions in order to ensure sustainable program results. The bidder will include a gender analysis and a description on how gender will be integrated into the proposed program in order to strengthen results. This should include identifying key gender-based constraints and assessing gender strategies. It is expected that the proposal should include: (1) identification of possible entry-points for incorporation of gender considerations in ongoing activities and potential new programs or activities in the new strategy; (2) provide statements of the key gender-based constraints relevant to AO 4 and the IRs; and identify resources and sources of sex-disaggregated data for developing gender-appropriate indicators. In addition, the proposal

13

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

should offer an analysis and discussion about how the proposed strategic approaches would impact the relative status of both male and female beneficiaries of the program. PERFORMANCE RESULTS Result 4.1. Use and access of Quality Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning Services Increased.

Background for Result 4.1 The MOH, IHSS and ASHONPLAFA, as the biggest service providers in the country, need to increase the availability of MCH and FP services through the development of their institutional capacity to deliver these services. In 2008, the MOH launched its first Obstetric and Neonatal Essential Care (ONEC) Strategy to address the major causes of maternal and neonatal deaths. Most service providers have been trained in this strategy, and after two years of implementation, almost 32,000 newborns have received essential newborn care through hospitals and maternal and child health clinics. As part of the ONEC strategy, the MOH has taken important steps to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates such as increasing the number of deliveries with a skilled birth attendant and increasing the number of women receiving the appropriate oxytocin dose during the third stage of labor. In 2009, the MOH launched its "National Initiative for the Reduction of Maternal and Child Death Rates" (RAMNI) which is a comprehensive strategy that looks to scale-up MCH best practices nationwide such as ONEC, FP, quality assurance and health reform and decentralization. Despite the progress that has been made, the MOH still needs support to implement the ONEC strategy at the national level, including developing skills and capacities of health staff, monitoring the quality of implementation, and evaluating the impact of the strategy. With regards to FP services, 2010 is the third year of a six-year phase-out strategy of USAID FP assistance in Honduras that will end in 2013. Given that USAID is the largest donor in family planning in Honduras, USG assistance has been focused on (1) supporting ASHONPLAFA and the MOH, the two largest FP service providers in the country, to plan for sustainable, routine family planning service delivery; (2) ensuring the availability of contraceptives in all MOH facilities; and, (3) increasing commercial sales of contraceptives among low income populations in urban and semiurban areas. USAID has supported the MOH to implement the National FP Strategy, which is now routinely implemented in 94% of the 1,200 public sector facilities. Although the FP strategy is well developed, it has not been reevaluated in the recent context of health sector reform and decentralization. As with ONEC, monitoring the quality of FP services and evaluating the impact of the FP strategy are priorities.

Indicators of success for Result 4.1 Result 4.1 will be measured through the following indicators by the end of the program:     Couple years of protection increased by 80% (baseline 450,000); Percentage of women receiving active management of the third stage of labor increased by 68% (baseline 32,000); Percentage of health units with an internal quality monitoring system of the essential obstetric and neonatal care services improved in 150% of the total of hospitals (baseline 4 hospitals); and Percentage of complications among newborns that were treated according to norms increased by 50% (baseline 32,000).

The Contractor shall ensure that any increase proposed in the above indicators will be substantiated with the most precise figures available in the country and that the source of those figures will be adequately cited in the proposal.

Result 4.2. Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning Services Sustained.

4.2.1 Health System Reformed to Provide Quality Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning Services Background for Sub-Intermediate Result 4.2.1 USAID support has been focused during the last five years in Health Systems Strengthening activities which continue to be a major component of AO 4. Implementation of health sector reform and decentralization has been critical in achieving the coverage and quality of services needed to improve the health status of the population. Health sector reform is allowing the delivery of a universal package of health services, guaranteeing that the GOH financing is utilized to cover the most vulnerable and poor populations. The health sector reform effort is aimed at strengthening the MOH central and district levels to perform their role to finance, regulate, and evaluate service delivery. The decentralization effort is aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the health services by shifting their management to local organizations, governments, and health units for increasing coverage, quality and accountability of services. To date, the MOH has designed the models of health care and financing, which are part of the National Policy on Health Reform and Decentralization that was launched in 2009. The new model of care defines the target populations, the basic type of services that each population will receive based on needs, and the service delivery networks within specific geographic areas. The financing model determines how the national resources available for health financing - including public revenues, formal contributions and out-of-pocket money - will be budgeted to pool risk and establish

15

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

different health financing schemes to cover the needs of the population. These products have been achieved with the involvement of the public sector, non-governmental organizations and the IHSS. As part of the reform efforts, the MOH has finalized the design to restructure at the central level. This restructuring will allow the MOH's central level to act as the steering body for financing, regulating and monitoring the provision of services, instead of being the actual service provider. In addition, by the end of FY 2009, the 20 sanitary regions were restructured to monitor and evaluate decentralized service delivery; however, the level to which these functions have been effectively implemented varies from region to region. Through technical assistance previously provided, the MOH has developed basic capacities to run a decentralized system. As part of the decentralization efforts, USAID, the World Bank, and the InterAmerican Development Bank have collaborated with the MOH to improve and decentralize MCH services in Honduras. The Banks, together with Italian debt relief funds, have financed contracts that the MOH has signed with third-party service providers, while USAID has provided technical assistance to the MOH to effectively run a decentralized system. In 2009, the MOH invested over $9.8 million to provide coverage to over 742,000 underserved rural people with a basic package of services. These contracts are shifting the accountability and management of health services to local levels to improve access, quality and transparency. Although the MOH has demonstrated commitment to improve the quality, efficiency and coverage of services, health reform and decentralization processes are not fully institutionalized and implemented in a sustainable manner throughout the country. In spite of the national health reform and decentralization policy statement that the "separation of functions" (stewardship and decentralization of services) is the key to transforming the system, the decentralization processes still have to be systematized. This includes how the MOH will decentralize its own health facilities networks and how they will be part of the new organization of the municipal/inter-municipal health networks. The decentralization of the MOH hospitals, due to the management complexity, requires special focus. The MOH at the central level must strengthen its own organizational development process and structure which will allow it to perform the financing, regulation, quality control and health assurance responsibilities. Taking the health care financing and provision models from the conceptual stages to implementation will be a major challenge. The MOH needs to make decisions of a quality assurance system, the approach the country will adopt, the development of tools and a plan for implementation within the health reform and decentralization process. Expanding the decentralization of services will also require support to better identify the most vulnerable and poorest populations as well as to define how the community will participate and be involved in public health planning, implementation and evaluation of the services. This component should offer an alternative and promising approach in terms of social auditing and effective citizens' participation in the decisions regarding their own health. This aspect should be presented as part of the decentralization process, rather than as a separate component, and should be coordinated closely with complementary efforts in other sectors, in particular with USAID's efforts in the democracy

16

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

and governance (DG) sector around transparent local government and improved service delivery (See relevant DG documents in the link provided in section D). The MOH unit that provides administrative and operational support for the decentralization of services must further strengthen its procurement system, especially in terms of polishing the monitoring process and indicators for performance-based payments (currently, the unit responsible for this task is the UECF; however, this situation may change based on the MOH's current reorganization processes). The 20 MOH regional levels also need support to implement the organizational development processes to enable them to perform their stewardship responsibilities and the monitoring, evaluation and quality control of services in their geographic area. Due to the complexity of the health reform and decentralization process, the contractor must ensure that all activities supported are in line with the GOH and with the Mission's strategic vision and direction. The contractor also has to make sure that the health reform and decentralization processes are coordinated with other donors, especially the World Bank (WB), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Indicators of success for Sub-Intermediate Result 4.2.1 This Sub-IR will be measured through the following indicators by the end of the program:     Percentage of the national health budget funding health financing arrangements increased 4 times (baseline 2.3%); Percentage of underserved people covered by health financing arrangements increased 2.2 times (baseline: 819,000 people); Equity in health financing measured by percentage of deliveries by skilled birth attendants improved by 50% in the lowest quintile (baseline 2005: 33%); Percentage of health units operating under health financing arrangements increased 2.2 times (baseline: 196 units).

The Contractor shall ensure that any increase proposed in the above indicators will be substantiated with the most precise figures available in the country and that the source of those figures will be adequately cited in the proposal. 4.2.2 Permanent Availability of Contraceptive Methods and Supplies Assured Background for Sub-Intermediate Result 4.2.2 After many years of USAID support in family planning, the contraceptive prevalence in modern methods has reached 56.4 percent. For this reason, the family planning program component is scheduled to graduate from USAID assistance in 2013. It is essential that primary family planning institutions in Honduras be strengthened so that they can continue providing high-level quality services when USAID support ends.

17

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

To ensure the permanent availability of contraceptives in all public facilities, the national "Contraceptive Security Committee" is engaged in forecasting national contraceptive requirements. The MOH budgeted over $1.2 million for the procurement of contraceptives for calendar year 2009, which covered about 65% of the public sector's contraceptive needs. With its improved forecasting capabilities, the MOH has developed more precise estimates for 2010 and made budget allocations, which are expected to meet the contraceptive needs for that year. Also, starting in 2010 and based on a memorandum of understanding signed in October 2009, the GOH will procure contraceptives at lower prices through the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) mechanism. This constitutes an essential step to ensure the sustainability of the FP national program. Despite these efforts, the FY 2009 procurement process was delayed and as a result, 42% of the public health facilities in the country experienced contraceptive stock-outs. It is important to note that in 2009, the MOH implemented a computerized inventory system in 12 out of its 20 sanitary regions which will facilitate obtaining data on permanent availability of contraceptives at local levels and feed it into the yearly contraceptive forecasting process. Regarding commercial efforts, ASHONPLAFA implements a social marketing program which manages one oral contraceptive brand, has launched a new injectable contraceptive, and sells four condom brands. These contraceptive products are aimed at low and middle income populations who can afford to pay for them. ASHONPLAFA provides family planning services through a network of 950 pharmacies, 210 non-traditional outlets and 1,515 community-based distribution posts across the country. Despite positive progress, the ability of the Contraceptive Security Committee (in which ASHONPLAFA, the MOH and the IHSS are members) to ensure availability of contraceptives for the sector remains a challenge. Service providers' capacities to plan finance, and forecast for contraceptive procurement and the logistics cycle for contraceptives all need to be strengthened. Indicators of success for Sub-Intermediate Result 4.2.2 This Sub-IR will be measured through the following indicators by the end of the program:    Percentage of delivery points reporting stock-outs of any contraceptive commodity offered decreased to reach 10% (baseline: 49%); Amount of in-country public and private financial resources leveraged for family planning commodities, activities and supplies increased to US$ 2.3/year; and Increase of cost recovery from social market programs to 16%.

The Contractor shall ensure that any increase proposed in the above indicators will be substantiated with the most precise figures available in the country and that the source of those figures will be adequately cited in the proposal.

Result 4.4 Epidemiological/health surveillance and M&E systems improved and updated

Background for Intermediate Result 4.4 USAID assistance for service delivery, health reform and decentralization has been complemented with efforts to improve the MOH's capability to monitor and evaluate maternal and child health activities. The national disease surveillance system, updated in FY 2008, is now routinely reporting maternal and child deaths; this has allowed GOH officials to make informed decision on appropriate interventions. Development and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system to describe the quality, coverage and efficiency of the interventions is critical to measuring impact. The reliability of the current health information system (HIS) remains a major challenge. New developments proposed on M&E and surveillance must take into account the proposal to strengthening the HIS which will be financed by the Canadian International Development Agency over the next couple of years. Indicators of success for Intermediate Result 4.4 This result will be measured through the indicator:  Number of MOH strategic approaches based on reliable epidemiological surveillance and monitoring and evaluation data. In regards to this result, it is expected that the Offeror propose a quantitative target for the indicator stated. Additional indicators may also be proposed based on it's the technical proposal contents and strategies.

The Contractor shall ensure that any increase proposed in the above indicators will be substantiated with the most precise figures available in the country and that the source of those figures will be adequately cited in the proposal.

D.3 BRANDING STRATEGY FOR USAID/HONDURAS ASSISTANCE UNIT FOR HEALTH PROJECT (ULAT) LOCAL TECHNICAL

In accordance with ADS Chapter 320 (Branding and Marking) and USAID's overall policy, all assistance delivered through this project should be clearly credited to the American people. This is accomplished through exclusive branding. This Branding Strategy (BS) outlines the framework in which materials and communications will be used to promote the project, deliver core development messages, and simultaneously communicate that the assistance is from the American people. The BS also ensures appropriate use of the USAID Identity. To implement the BS, the Offeror shall develop

20

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

a Branding Implementation Plan (BIP) and a Marking Plan (MP). Both plans shall adhere to the BS outlined below and be prepared in accordance with ADS 320.3.2 and 320.2.3, respectively. The BIP and MP shall be submitted as part of the Offeror's response to the RFP and along with the technical proposal. Neither should exceed three pages and neither will be subject to the page limit imposed on the technical proposals. Marking and branding shall comply with USAID `Graphics Standards Manual" available at www.usaid.gov/branding, or any successor branding policy.

A. BRANDING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (BIP) The BIP shall describe how the program will be promoted to local partners and host country citizens, specifically stating how the Offeror shall incorporate, promote, and publicize the health systems strengthening and service delivery messages and that "This assistance is from the American people" in its communications and material. B. Marking Plan (MP) The MP shall detail the public communications, commodities, program materials, and other items that visibly bear or will be marked with the USAID identity. The MP is also the vehicle for Offerors to request exceptions, if necessary, to the marking requirements. Program Name: USAID/Honduras Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

Positioning: The Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health (ULAT) is a USAID/Honduras Health activity. The goal of the project is to provide support to the Government of Honduras (GOH) in order to strengthen the health system to improve efficiency, quality, equity and impact of health interventions. Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to provide technical support to the MOH, IHSS, Honduran Family Planning Association (ASHONPLAFA) and other partners to (1) improve quality of and access to sustained FP and MCH services and (2) to improve the national health system through health sector reform and decentralization of health services to further impact maternal/reproductive health and neonatal/child health. The main audiences of the project will be the Ministry of Health (MOH) officials, local governments, and Honduran citizens, both individually and collectively (community-based organizations), non-governmental organizations, and the Honduran Social Security Institute (IHSS). Secondary audiences will include officials from other central government entities, the National Congress, USAID and other donor organizations. The key message will be "transformation of the health system will provide better access and quality of health services for Honduran citizens." The Offeror should provide a strategy to position the Unidad Local de Apoyo Técnico para Salud Project so that the main audiences are knowledgeable about key messages and understand the key development goals of this project and that is supported "by the American people" via USAID. The Offeror should also develop a project sub-brand to include the tagline "From the American People" translated into the language of the document (e.g. Spanish). For reference, see http//www.usaid.gov/branding/.

21

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

Public Outreach: The Unidad Local de Apoyo Técnico para Salud Project will promote activities to encourage civic and political engagement and support interaction between and among stakeholders on issues of national and local interest, including the transformation of the health system to separate the regulation, financing, service provision, and monitoring and evaluation functions of the Ministry of Health; improved access for Honduran people to quality health services; and increased accountability and community participation in health service delivery. The Offeror will inform the public and its main audiences about the main development messages, areas/elements of focus, and associated activities through a development communications strategy that should include strategic communications methods and creative, properly-branded materials. Level of Visibility: In the Unidad Local de Apoyo Técnico para Salud Project, the USAID identity will have a high level of visibility so that its audiences grasp the extent of the aid provided by the American people. In cases where the audience should perceive the involvement of the MOH and other local actors as primary, USAID visibility may be equal to or lesser than that of other partners. The offeror should suggest the range of possibilities in their BIP and MP, including examples of cobranding with local partners where USAID might have lesser or equal prominence and visibility in order to best meet the objectives of the activity. Anticipated Elements of the Marking Plan: Deliverables to be marked include products; equipment and inputs delivered; places where project activities are carried out; external public communications, studies, reports, publications, and informative and promotional products; and workshops, conferences, fairs, media related activities and other such events. When prior USAID review or approval has not been received or when the COTR deems it necessary, publications authored by contractors, or other non-USAID employees must include the following disclaimer (in the primary language of the document) on the title page: "This (type of publications) is made possible by the support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)". The contents of this (specify) are the sole responsibility of (name of the organization) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United States Agency for International Development or the United States Government. Threats and restrictions to the security of the project need to be identified and assessed in order to request any necessary exception from marking requirement in accordance with ADS 302.3.2. USAID's web page (http//www.usaid.gov/branding) contains the electronic version of the Graphic Standards Manual that is compulsory guidance for all contractors. Exceptions and Prohibitions: The following is prohibited for the contractor: a. Use of USAID Identity in administrative and internal communications (ADS 320.3.1.5). b. Use of USAID Identity in business cards (ADS320.3.1.6).

The full text of the policy paper can be found at the following website: http://pdf.dec.org/pdf_docs/PDABQ631.pdf.

46

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

mitigation measures described in the pertinent Threshold Decision for each of these activities are funded and implemented, including any necessary training or capacity building, and adequate monitoring. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, Section 117 requires that the impact of USAID's activities on the environment be considered and that USAID include environmental sustainability as a central consideration in designing and carrying out its development programs. This mandate is codified in Federal Regulations (22 CFR 216) and in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) Parts 201.5.10g and 204 (http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ADS/200/), which, in part, require that the potential environmental impacts of USAID-financed activities are identified prior to a final decision to proceed and that appropriate environmental safeguards are adopted for all activities. Contractor's environmental compliance obligations under these regulations and procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this contract. In addition, the contractor/recipient must comply with host country environmental regulations unless otherwise directed in writing by USAID. In case of conflict between host country and USAID regulations, the latter shall govern. No activity funded under this contract will be implemented unless an environmental threshold determination, as defined by 22 CFR 216, has been reached for that activity, as documented in a Request for Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), or Environmental Assessment (EA) duly signed by the Bureau Environmental Officer (BEO). (Hereinafter, such documents are described as "approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation."). As part of its initial Work Plan, and all Annual Work Plans thereafter, the contractor, in collaboration with the COTR and Mission Environmental Officer or Bureau Environmental Officer, as appropriate, shall review all ongoing and planned activities under this contract to determine if they are within the scope of the approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation. If the contractor plans any new activities outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation, it shall prepare an amendment to the documentation for USAID review and approval. No such new activities shall be undertaken prior to receiving written USAID approval of environmental documentation amendments

(a) Definitions. Common parent, as used in this provision, means that corporate entity that owns or controls an affiliated group of corporations that files its Federal income tax returns on a consolidated basis, and of which the offeror is a member. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), as used in this provision, means the number required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be used by the offeror in reporting income tax and other returns.

K.3 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-- (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.2097, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final

76

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. K.4 52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-- "Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not

(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. (iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-- (A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or (B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. (iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. (d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). "Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).

98

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

The Program Strategy must be in compliance with USAID statutory and regulatory framework for AO 4 "Health Status for Underserved and Vulnerable Populations Improved" to ensure that the proposed assistance is appropriate. The Program Strategy should describe the Offeror's methodology, financial and administrative approaches, including in specific detail the activities that will be undertaken with regard to each result and indicators.

II. MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PERSONNEL

To achieve the results described in this statement of work, the Contractor must provide a technical assistance team with a variety of specialties and skills.

The Contractor's management plan shall include a complete proposed staffing pattern to achieve the results for this contract. The Contractor will provide sufficient staff to facilitate all administrative, technical and support functions necessary and will submit a description of the staff. As USAID/Honduras is focused on building national capacities for the health sector, recruitment of national experts is highly encouraged as long as the individuals proposed fulfill the necessary

99

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

For each team member proposed, the bidder must also provide a list of three references, including at least one current or former supervisor, with name, title, organization, nature of professional relationship with the candidate, telephone number and e-mail. Although the Contractor will propose the staffing pattern, it is expected that the proposal will include a Deputy Chief of Party and Senior Technical Advisors by primary project component, as well as a local administrative staff. A certification that the utilization of the proposed personnel did not result from a suggestion by an USAID employee. This certification is required since it is the Contractor's responsibility to identify and provide technical expertise required to fulfill USAID's needs. III. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND PAST PERFORMANCE

Demonstrated satisfactory relevant technical experience and demonstrated satisfactory capability to provide full managerial, financial and technical support to achieve the program results. Performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and best value decision. Information on past performance must be provided in accordance with the following table. USAID may use performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the bidders. USAID will utilize existing databases of contractor performance information and solicit additional information from the references provided herein and contact the individual(s) indicated as well as others. If the performance information contains negative information on which the bidders have not previously been given an opportunity to comment, USAID will provide the bidders an opportunity to comment on it prior to its consideration in the evaluation. The past performance references for similar activities shall be included as annex or attachment to the Program Strategy. In cases where an offeror lacks relevant performance history and/or information on performance is not available, the bidder will not then be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on performance. IV. Gender Integration:

Gender integration in proposals will be evaluated with the following criteria in mind: the extent to which gender is integrated based on sound gender analysis; the feasibility of the interventions; the extent to which the gender approach and interventions are innovative, progressive, and have potential to promote gender equality, promote women's empowerment, and ensure sustainable

100

program results; and the potential for proposed monitoring and evaluation to illustrate the impact of interventions on men and women. Title: Past Performance Evaluation Table Scope of work summary Primary location of work Term of performance Dollar Value Contract type & Number COTR name COTR email address and Tel. No.

NOTE: USAID relies on the prime organization's review of partner/subcontractor institutions. However, if deemed necessary to ensure prudent use of USG funds, USAID may conduct its own past performance review of proposed partners/subcontractor institutions.

COST

Each cost proposal will be evaluated, but will not be assigned a rating. The evaluation cost will include a determination of accuracy, completeness, and reasonableness. The Government will also evaluate the proposed costs to determine if they are realistic using proposal analysis techniques consistent with FAR 15.404. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 1. The offeror should foster collaboration, information sharing and close coordination with other USAID implementing partners, and other activities of relevance to the USAID AO 4, including the MOH; other GOH entities; other donors; other USG agencies and projects, and with contractors and partners. It is essential that interventions under this contract be developed in strict collaboration with the MOH and all other involved parties in order to achieve standardization and sustainability. 2. Interventions must be coordinated closely between the Recipient, GOH and USAID/Honduras. A consensus-based approach for decision-making among these three entities shall be used whenever possible. Collaboration with institutions carrying out activities related or complementary to programs proposed within the contract is strongly recommended in order to maximize results. 3. The Contractor shall coordinate activities with other USAID projects in Honduras and bilateral and multilateral partners, as applicable, while planning and implementing interventions. The relationship with other USAID/Honduras funded projects should be close and collaborative and coordinated with the COTR to maximize resource allocation, avoid duplication and to enhance synergy with others partners and other donors' initiatives.

106

USAID/Honduras SOL-522-10-000003 Local Technical Assistance Unit for Health Project (ULAT)

subcontractors). (See FAR 9.104-3(a)); (6) Have the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability to obtain them (See FAR 9.104- 3(a)); and (7) Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations (e.g., Equal Opportunity, Clean Air and Water, Small Business Subcontracting, etc.). (h) Part 8 - Letters of Commitment (Major Subcontractors) The Cost/Business Proposal must include a letter, on subcontractor letterhead, and signed by an authorized representative of each subcontractor, which specifically indicates the subcontractor's agreement to be included in the offeror's proposed teaming arrangement. (i) Part 9 - Information to Support Consent to Subcontractors The offeror must address each of the elements in FAR 44.202-2 in order for proposed subcontractors to be considered by the contracting officer for consent of subcontractors to be granted with the initial award. (j) Part 10 - Information Concerning Work-Day, Work-Week, and Paid Absences (1) The Offeror and each proposed major subcontractor shall indicate the number of hours and days in its normal work-day and its normal work-week, both domestically and overseas, for employees and consultants. In addition, the offeror and each proposed major subcontractor shall indicate how paid absences (US holidays, local holidays, vacation and sick) shall be covered. (2) A normal work-year, including paid absences (holidays, vacations, and sick leave) is 2,080 hours (260 days x 8 hours per day). However, some organizations do not have an 8-hour workday, and some accounting systems normally provide for direct recovery of paid absences by using a workyear of less than 2,080 hours to compute individuals' unburdened daily rates. The offeror and major subcontractors shall describe their core work day and work week policies. (3) The work day and work week policies and the method of accounting for paid absences for the offeror and major subcontractors will be incorporated into the content in Section B. [END OF SECTION L]

M.3

EVALUATION SYSTEM

The following adjectival scoring system will be used as by the technical evaluation committee to assess each of the technical criteria and sub-criteria and the technical proposal as a whole:
"Outstanding" O Very significantly exceeds most or all solicitation requirements. Response exceeds a "Better" rating. The Offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated. B Fully meets all solicitation requirements and significantly exceeds many of the solicitation requirements. Response exceeds an "Acceptable" rating. The areas in which the Offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality. A Meets all solicitation requirements. Complete, comprehensive, and exemplifies an understanding of the scope and depth of the task requirements as well as the Offeror's understanding of the Government's requirements. M Less than "Acceptable." There are some deficiencies in the technical proposal. However, given the opportunity for discussions, the technical proposal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least "Acceptable." (Areas of a technical proposal which remain to be "Marginal" after "Final Proposal Revision" offers shall not be subject to further discussion or revision.) If award is made on the initial offers, there will not be an opportunity for discussions nor a chance to become at least "Acceptable." U Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions: Failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the required tasks; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; failure to meet many personnel requirements of the solicitation. (When applying this adjective to the technical proposal as a whole, the technical proposal must be so unacceptable in one or areas that it would have to be significantly revised to attempt to make it other than acceptable.)

"Better"

"Acceptable"

"Marginal"

"Unacceptable"

BEST VALUE The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors as set forth in this solicitation. Best value is defined as the offer that results in the most advantageous solution for the USG, in consideration of the evaluation factors listed in this section. M.4 COST PROPOSAL EVALUATION

Each cost proposal will be evaluated, but will not be assigned a rating. The evaluation cost will include a determination of accuracy, completeness, and reasonableness. The Government will also evaluate the proposed costs, to determine if they are realistic using proposal analysis techniques consistent with FAR 15.404.

112

M.5

DETERMINATION OF THE COMPETITIVE RANGE AND CONTRACT AWARD

(a) Competitive Range: If the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary, he/she will establish a Competitive Range composed of only the most highly rated proposals. In certain circumstances the Contracting Officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. Should that be the case, the Contracting Officer may then limit offers in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offers. The Government may exclude an offer if it is so deficient as to essentially require a new technical proposal. The Government may exclude an offer so unreasonably priced, in relation to more competitive offers, as to appear that there will be little or no chance of becoming competitive. The Government may exclude an offer requiring extensive discussions, a complete rewrite, or major revisions, to allow an Offeror unfair advantage over those more competitive offers. (a) Award: In accordance with FAR 52.215-1(f), the Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represent the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and sub factors as set forth in this solicitation.

M.6

CONTRACTING WITH SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS AND DISADVANTAGED ENTERPRISES

USAID encourages the participation of small business concerns and disadvantaged enterprises in this project, in accordance with FAR Part 19 (48 CFR Chapter 1), and AIDAR Part 726 (48 CFR Chapter 7). Accordingly, every reasonable effort will be made to identify and make use of such organizations. All evaluation criteria being found equal, the participation of such organizations may become a determining factor for selection. [END OF SECTION M]

LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN EFFECTIVE JUNE 24, 2010 (40 hours Workweek)

Many firms use the U.S. Embassy's Local Compensation plan as a basis for estimating local labor costs. This is based on the concept that the U.S. Embassy & USAID pay reasonable salaries. Both Position Classification and Compensation are applied to determine the reasonableness of an individual position's salary under the system used by USAID and the Embassy. The following pay ranges reflect the approximate equivalent base salary paid by the U.S. Government. In addition to this salary, the employees receive benefits normally required under the Honduran Labor Law.
