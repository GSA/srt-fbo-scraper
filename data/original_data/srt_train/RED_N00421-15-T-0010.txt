           n. Basic Linux install for burn-in only - (we have to go through a complete re-install)
           o. Uninterruptable power supply

        Equivalent products that meet/exceed the system requirement will be accepted.

        2. Warranty




           The systems must be covered by a standard advance replacement warranty.




           a. Vendor shall provide a 1-year warranty on the hardware and technical support for 1-year.

           b. Advance replacement of defective hardware with exact or equivalent components.



    II) Selection Criteria




        1. Use of quality components (including quietest cooling fans) while maintaining the best price and performance.

        2. Vendors are required to specify the exact brand and model names of each component to be offered.   In addition, better scores will be
           given to detailed itemized price lists.

        3. Good track records of supplying high-end engineering workstations and providing after-sales technical support for hardware and
           software related problems.

                 (ii) Any other activities not included in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this clause that allow unauthorized access to the Contractor's
unclassified information system on which unclassified controlled technical information is resident on or transiting.
            (3) Other reporting requirements. This reporting in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for additional safeguarding any
cyber incident reporting requirements pertaining to its unclassified information systems under other clauses that may apply to its contract, or
as a result of other U.S. Government legislative and regulatory requirements that may apply (e.g., as cited in paragraph (c) of this clause).
            (4) Contractor actions to support DoD damage assessment. In response to the reported cyber incident, the Contractor shall --
                 (i) Conduct further review of its unclassified network for evidence of compromise resulting from a cyber incident to include,
but is not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data and users accounts. This includes analyzing information systems
that were part of the compromise, as well as other information systems on the network that were accessed as a result of the compromise.
                 (ii) Review the data accessed during the cyber incident to identify specific unclassified controlled technical information
associated with DoD programs, systems or contracts, including military programs, systems and technology; and
                 (iii) Preserve and protect images of known affected information systems and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at
least 90 days from the cyber incident to allow DoD to request information or decline interest.
            (5) DoD damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the
Contractor point of contact identified in the incident report at (d)(1) of this clause provide all of the damage assessment information gathered
in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this clause. The Contractor shall comply with damage assessment information requests. The requirement to
share files and images exists unless there are legal restrictions that limit a company's ability to share digital media. The Contractor shall
inform the Contracting Officer of the source, nature, and prescription of such limitations and the authority responsible.
      (e) Protection of reported information. Except to the extent that such information is lawfully publicly available without restrictions,
the Government will protect information reported or otherwise provided to DoD under this clause in accordance with applicable statutes,
regulations, and policies. The Contractor shall identify and mark attribution information reported or otherwise provided to the DoD. The
Government may use information, including attribution information and disclose it only to authorized persons for purposes and activities
consistent with this clause.
      (f) Nothing in this clause limits the Government's ability to conduct law enforcement or counterintelligence activities, or other lawful
activities in the interest of homeland security and national security. The results of the activities described in this clause may be used to
support an investigation and prosecution of any person or entity, including those attempting to infiltrate or compromise information on a
contractor information system in violation of any statute.
      (g) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g), in all subcontracts, including
subcontracts for commercial items.
