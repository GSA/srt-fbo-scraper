Statement of Work

Video and Webcast Hosting and Transmission Services



INTRODUCTION

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is an independent federal government law enforcement and regulatory agency with the authority to promote and protect consumers’ welfare through its jurisdiction over both consumer protection and competition issues.  The FTC headquarters offices are located at , , and  Street, NW, .  There also are eight regional offices located in , ; , ; , ; , ; , ; , ; , ; and 



The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regularly conducts press conferences, presentations, workshops, hearings, and other public conferences as part of its mission.  Part of the FTC’s responsibility to the general public is to provide timely information regarding matters that impact consumers.  



Within the FTC, the objective of the Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is to research, acquire and support enterprise-wide Information Technology (IT) to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the FTC’s operations and to support the agency’s mission.  



PURPOSE

The purpose of this Statement of Work is to acquire a commercial webcast and video hosting solution provider.  The goal is to provide the agency’s constituency, free, on-demand, and digital access to these public events; both as they occur (live) and previously captured (archived) and to provide a long-term hosting solution for webcast and public service videos.  



BACKGROUND

The FTC produces two types of digital media: 

Live webcasts, which can be 10 hours long or more, shot in low-resolution; and short videos, usually just a few minutes long, and generally shot in high-resolution.  The agency hosts live webcast events nationally.  Due to budget constraints in FY2010, the agency produced only 9 webcasts, for a total of 44 hours; conversely, before budget constraints, 37 events (for a total of 233 hours) were webcast in FY2009.  In FY2011 to date, the agency has produced 4 webcasts, for a total of 22 hours.  The agency is anticipating producing over 50 additional webcast hours during FY2011, and anticipates the number of webcast hours will eventually increase.  The agency anticipates a 5-10% growth in webcast capture each year over the duration of the contract.



Edited videos range from about 1 minute to 10 minutes in length, but are 2-3 minutes long on average.  The FTC has about 85 short edited videos on FTC.gov.  They received about 560,000 views in FY 2010.  The agency anticipates a 15-30% growth in edited video production each year over the duration of the contract.
