requirements.


Final regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) provide privacy and security standards that must  be  observed  in
the handling of patient data resulting from biomedical research.  HIPAA privacy standards will be used to establish safeguards  and  restrictions
for the use and disclosure of research records.  HIPAA security  standards  will  be  used  to  help  cancer  centers  implement  administrative,
physical, and technical safeguards to protect electronic health information.  Improper use or  disclosure  of  sensitive  information  under  the
rules may be subject to criminal or civil sanctions prescribed in HIPAA.

      purpose, and to have or permit others to do so; (b) make, have made, use, practice, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise  dispose
      of Deliverables (or portions thereof); (c) distribute and have distributed to and by third parties Deliverables and any  modifications  and
      derivative works thereof; and (d) sublicense the foregoing rights set out in (a), (b) and (c) to third  parties,  including  the  right  to
      license such rights to further third parties. Proprietary Technical Data and  modifications  or  extensions  of  Proprietary  Software  not

           anticipated that Subcontractor will file patent applications on Deliverables, but if it  does,  Subcontractor  agrees  that  it  will
           permit any Deliverables covered by patent applications or issued patents to be used for research or educational purposes by the caBIG
           Community and the public without charge under terms that are consistent with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  Principles  for

                                                   SECTION  M  --  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

ARTICLE M.1.  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The assessment of Offers received in response to this solicitation will be carefully considered against the needs of SAIC-Frederick, Inc.  (SAIC-
Frederick) and the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology.  This assessment is not intended to be a  solely  mechanical
or mathematical analysis of an Offer, but rather the product of both objective and subjective measurements and judgments of the source  selection
officials after consideration of the relevant information.

Basis for Award:

SAIC-Frederick will award approximately five subcontracts resulting from this RFP to the responsible organizations  whose  offers  conforming  to
the RFP will be the most advantageous to the SAIC-Frederick, price and other factors considered.

            Potential Award Without Discussions:

SAIC-Frederick reserves the right to award a subcontract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the  initial  prices  are
fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

Therefore, the Offeror’s initial offer should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a price and technical  standpoint.   However,  SAIC-Frederick
reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  SAIC-Frederick may reject any  or  all
proposals if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest price; and  waive  informalities  and  minor  irregularities  in
proposals received.

Evaluation Factors:

In descending order of relative importance, the following factors shall be used to evaluate the prospective Offers:

   1. Scientific Merit/Technical Plan
   2. Personnel
   3. Past Performance
   4. Scope of Work

(1)   Scientific Merit/Technical Plan

Proposals will be judged primarily on the basis of their Scientific Merit.  The primary criteria for the proposed work will include:

         • Importance of the research problems relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute
         • Advancement of scientific knowledge or clinical practice if the aims of the research are achieved
         • Effects on the concepts, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive contemporary oncology

In addition the following will be judged as part of the Scientific Merit of the proposed research;

         • Adequacy of the plan to use and make openly available caBIG and other public or private research resources  (according  to  the  data
           sharing plan)
         • Adequacy of the planned research products
         • Adequacy of the plans and procedures for public release of the planned research products according to the data sharing plan
         • Adequacy of the plans to add to capabilities available through caBIG such as a Grid node that provides  access  to  interesting  data
           and/or novel analysis or data mining capabilities.

(2)   Personnel

Describe the personnel who will be assigned to both manage and perform the work under this proposed subcontract.  Resume summaries for  at  least
3 personnel, including the ISRCE Director and Principal Investigator (who may be the same person) as Key Personnel, are required that  will  show
each person's general qualifications and recent experience with similar research.  The role each person is to play shall be described.

Personnel described should demonstrate (in aggregate) at least the following:

   1. Skills in bioinformatics, computational biology and/or systems biology research
   2. A track record of participating in or forming research collaborations
   3. A track record in sharing data and/or providing open source algorithms and tools
   4. Knowledge of project management and managing research efforts of this size and/or scope

(3)   Past Performance

The past performance shall demonstrate the Offeror’s background and the experience of the proposed personnel in  conducting  research  activities
of this size and/or complexity.  The Offeror shall describe at least 3 examples of similar research performed by proposed  team  members  in  the
past.  For each research example, provide research and findings summary, value, period of performance, and contact information  for  the  Agency,
Project and/or Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative for the grant or contract that funded the work.

In addition, the Offeror’s proposal shall explicitly address the following;

Demonstration of preexisting knowledge of publications and curated biomedical databases; knowledge of  other  publicly  and  privately  available
data sets and tools to collect, utilize, manage data stores, and interpret data at several points and  levels  of  analysis  along  a  hypothesis
driven bioinformatics pipeline; technical expertise in data integration  and  analysis  across  different  data  types;  skills  in  using  caBIG
infrastructure, data sets and tools.

(4)   Cost Realism

Price will not be explicitly scored.  However, the scope of work that is proposed  will  be  considered  in  comparison  to  the  price  offered.
Therefore, offerors shall clearly justify the proposed price in terms of the proposed work to be performed.  This justification  must  include  a
basis of estimate for each milestone proposed and shall be so substantive as to enable SAIC-F to determine that the prices proposed are fair  and
reasonable when considered against the work to be undertaken.

SAIC-F reserves the right to request additional information in order to make this determination and to forgo award if unable to do so.

Seller shall, at its expense, indemnify, defend, save and hold Buyer and its successors,  affiliates,  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,

the right to return goods already accepted or for which Buyer has made payment.  Acceptance or payment shall not be deemed  to  be  a  waiver  of
Buyer’s right to cancel or return all or any part of the goods because of failure to conform to the  Order  or  by  reason  of  defects,  whether
latent or patent, or other breach of warranty, or to make any claim for damages of any and all kind.

19.   INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR WORK ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION
If this Order entails effort on a Government installation, including any off-site buildings owned or leased by the Government,  the  Seller  must
provide and maintain the minimum amounts of insurance stated below.

At Buyer’s request, Seller agrees to provide Certificates of Insurance evidencing  that  the  required  insurance  coverages  are  in  force  and
providing not less than thirty days written notice prior to any cancellation or restrictive modification of the policies.

Further, the required insurance coverages below shall be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other insurance that may be  maintained
by Buyer.  The below required coverages and their limits in no way lessen nor affect Seller’s other obligations or liabilities set forth in  this
Order.

a. Statutory Workers’ Compensation and Employer’s Liability in an amount no  less  than  $1  Million  per  occurrence  covering  its  employees,
   including a waiver of subrogation obtained from the carrier in favor of Buyer;


b. Commercial General Liability in an amount no less than $1 Million per each occurrence and  $2  Million  in  this  Aggregate  covering  bodily
   injury, broad form property damage, personal injury, products and completed operations, contractual liability  and  independent  contractors’
   liability.  Buyer, its officers and employees shall be included as Additional Insureds and a waiver of subrogation shall be obtained from the
   carrier in favor of Buyer;


c. Automobile Liability in an amount no less than $1 Million Combined Single Limit for Bodily Injury covering use of all owned,  non-owned,  and

d. Professional Liability in an amount no less than $1 Million per occurrence covering damages caused by any acts, errors, and omissions arising
   out of the professional services performed by Seller, or any person for whom the Seller is legally liable.  To the extent that  coverage  for
   Seller’s services are not excluded in (ii) above by virtue of being deemed not of a professional nature, this requirement does not apply.


e. All-Risk Property Insurance in an amount adequate to replace property, including supplies covered by this  Order,  of  Buyer  and/or  Buyer’s
   customer that may be in the possession or control of Seller.  Buyer shall be named as a Loss Payee with respect to loss  or  damage  to  said
   property and/or supplies furnished by Buyer.

and notwithstanding any provision contained  herein,  Seller,  and  its  employees,  agents,  representatives,  consultants,  Subcontractors  and
suppliers, are not insured by the Buyer, and are not covered under any policy of insurance that the Buyer has obtained or has in place.

Any self-insured retentions, deductibles and exclusions in coverage in the policies required under this Article shall  be  assumed  by,  for  the
account of, and at the sole risk of Seller which provides the insurance and to the extent applicable shall be paid by Seller.  In no event  shall
the liability of Seller be limited to the extent of any insurance or the minimum limits required herein.

20.   EXPORT CONTROL COMPLIANCE FOR FOREIGN PERSONS
Seller shall not, nor shall Seller authorize or permit its employees,  agents  or  lower  tiers  to  disclose,  export  or  re-export  any  Buyer
information, or any process, product or services that is produced under this Order, without prior notification to Buyer and  complying  with  all
applicable Federal, State and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including the regulations of the U.S. Department  of  Commerce  and/or  the
U.S. Department of State.  In addition, Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer if Seller  is  listed  on  any  of  the  Department  of  State,
Treasury or Commerce proscribed persons or destinations lists, or if Seller’s export privileges are otherwise denied,  suspended  or  revoked  in
whole or in part.

Inc. to protected individuals as established under the guidelines of the Commerce Department Export  Administration  Regulations  (EAR)  and  the
State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

goods and/or technical data from the United States may require an export control license from the U.S. Government and  that,  failure  to  obtain
such export control license may result in termination of Order, and/or criminal liability under U.S. laws.

Seller shall have the right to assign this Order to any successor of such party  by  way  of  merger  or  consolidation  or  the  acquisition  of
substantially all of the business and assets of the Seller relating to the subject matter of this Order.  This right shall be  retained  provided
that such successor shall expressly assume all of the obligations and liabilities of the Seller under this  Order,  and  that  the  Seller  shall
remain liable and responsible to Buyer for the performance and observance of all such obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts due the Seller may be assigned in accordance with the provisions of the clause  52.232-23,  Assignment

(A) If a decision relating to the Prime Contract is made by the NCI-Frederick Contracting Officer and such  decision  is  also  related  to  this
Order, said decision, if binding upon Buyer under the Prime Contract shall in turn be binding upon Buyer and Seller with respect to such  matter;
provided, however, that if Seller disagrees with any such decision made by the NCI Contracting Officer and Buyer elects not to  appeal  any  such
decision, Seller shall have the right reserved to Buyer under the Prime Contract with the Government to prosecute a timely appeal in the name  of
Buyer, as permitted by the contract or by law, Seller to bear its own legal and other costs.  If Buyer elects not to appeal  any  such  decision,
Buyer agrees to notify Seller in a timely fashion after receipt of such decision and to assist Seller in its prosecution of any  such  appeal  in
every reasonable manner.  If Buyer elects to appeal any such decision of the NCI Contracting Officer, Buyer agrees to furnish Seller promptly  of
a copy of such appeal. Any decision upon appeal, if binding upon Buyer, shall in turn  be  binding  upon  Seller.   Pending  the  making  of  any
decision, either by the NCI Contracting Officer or on appeal, Seller shall proceed diligently with performance of this Order.

If, as a result of any decision or judgment whish is binding upon Seller and Buyer, as provided above, Buyer  is  unable  to  obtain  payment  or
reimbursement from the Government under the Prime Contract for, or is required to refund or credit to the Government, any amount with respect  to
any item or matter for which the Buyer has  reimbursed  or  paid  Seller,  Seller  shall,  on  demand,  promptly  repay  such  amount  to  Buyer.
Additionally, pending the final conclusion of any appeal hereunder, Seller shall, on demand promptly repay any such  amount  to  Buyer.   Buyer's
maximum liability for any matter connected with or related to this Order which was properly the subject of a claim against the  Government  under
the Prime Contract shall not exceed the amount of the Buyer's recovery from the Government.

Seller agrees to provide certification that data supporting any claim made by Seller hereunder is made in good  faith  and  that  the  supporting
data is accurate and complete to the best of the Seller's knowledge or belief, all in accordance with the requirements of the Contracts  Disputes
Act of 1978 (41USC601-613) and implementing regulations. If any claim of Seller is determined to be based on  upon  fraud  or  misrepresentation,
Seller agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Buyer harmless for any and all liability, loss, cost, or expense resulting there from.

Any dispute not addressed in paragraph (A) above, will be subject to paragraph (B) as described below.

(B) Buyer and Seller agree to first enter into negotiations to resolve any controversy, claim or dispute (“dispute”) arising  under  or  relating
to this Order.  The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of such dispute within a reasonable  period
of time.  If good faith negotiations are unsuccessful, Buyer and Seller agree to  resolve  the  dispute  by  binding  and  final  arbitration  in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  The arbitration  shall  take  place  in
the County of Frederick, State of Maryland.  The arbitrator(s) shall be bound to follow the provisions of this Order in  resolving  the  dispute,
and may not award punitive damages.  The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be  final  and  binding  on  the  parties,  and  any  award  of  the
arbitrator(s) may be entered or enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Seller hereby waives any immunity, sovereign or otherwise, that it would otherwise  have  to  such  jurisdiction  and  agrees  that  its  rights,
obligations, and liabilities hereunder shall be determined in the same manner and to the same extent as those of a private  litigant  under  like
circumstances.

All costs of the arbitration shall be shared equally between the Parties, but the Parties specifically agree  that  each  Party  shall  bear  the
expense of any costs incurred by it for its own counsel, experts, witnesses, preparation of documents, presentations, and  logistics  related  to
the proceedings.

Pending any decision, appeal or judgment referred to in this provision or the settlement of any dispute arising under this  Order,  Seller  shall
proceed diligently with the performance of this Order.

23.   NOTIFICATION OF DEBARMENT/SUSPENSION

lower tiers, nor any of its principals, is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment  by  the  Federal  Government.  Further,  Seller  shall
provide immediate written notice to the Buyer in the event that during performance of  this  Order  the  Seller  or  any  of  its  principals  is
debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment by the Federal Government.

24.   QUALITY ASSURANCE/INSPECTION
All goods furnished and services performed pursuant hereto shall be subject to inspection and test by Buyer at all reasonable times  and  places,
during the Order term, and in any event, prior to Final Acceptance as that term is defined in the Statement of Work.  No  inspection  made  prior
to Final Acceptance shall relieve Seller from responsibility for defects or other to meet the failure requirements of this Order.  In  the  event
that goods furnished or services supplied are not in accordance with the Statement of  Work  and  Schedule  or  other  requirements.   Buyer  may
require Seller to promptly correct, repair, replace or re-perform the goods or services.  The cost of correction,  repair,  replacement,  or  re-
performance shall be determined under Section 7 of this Order.  If Seller fails to proceed with reasonable promptness  to  perform  the  required
correction, repair, replacement, or re-performance, Buyer may terminate the Order for default.  If Seller is unable to accomplish the  foregoing,
then Buyer may procure such materials and services from another source or perform such services in-house  and  charge  to  Seller’s  account  all
costs, expenses and damages associated therewith.  Buyer’s approval of designs furnished by Seller shall not relieve Seller  of  its  obligations
hereunder.

ARTICLE C.1.  STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE




1.    BACKGROUND


The National Cancer Institute, a biomedical research funding agency that is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, has invested  heavily
in the generation of large scale clinical and molecular data sets.  The NCI  through  its  Center  for  Biomedical  Informatics  and  Information
Technology (NCI CBIIT) has sponsored the development of the Cancer  Biomedical  Informatics  Grid®  (caBIG®)  initiative,  a  common  informatics
infrastructure that incorporates and encourages the use of common data standards, caBIG® is an  open  source,  open  access  information  network
connecting the cancer research community and enabling the sharing of data and tools.  Using the caBIG infrastructure, researchers can  accelerate
their ability to share, integrate and analyze data.  By providing a comprehensive collection of interoperable  software  tools,  data  standards,
and computing infrastructure, the caBIG initiative promotes data and knowledge exchange, simplifies collaboration, and ultimately  helps  realize
the potential of molecular medicine.

The availability of large scale clinical and molecular data sets and the presence of a wide range of tools that can be used  for  their  analysis
create important new opportunities for the development and refinement of biomedical knowledge using  in  silico  methods.   NCI  CBIIT  seeks  to
develop a group of “in silico Research Centers” (“ISRCEs” or “Centers”) with core competencies  in  bioinformatics.   The  primary  goal  of  the
ISRCEs will be to add scientific value to the large scale datasets funded by the NCI and other federal agencies that are accessible  through  the
caGrid as well as through other sources.  This will be  accomplished  by  applying  contemporary  methods  in  biomedical  and/or  bioinformatics
analysis in order to make discoveries that have the potential to  rapidly  advance  our  understanding  of  cancer  etiology  and  its  effective
treatment and prevention.  For purposes of this solicitation, in silico research  is  any  research  conducted  using  computational  methods  on
biomedical data, which may include computer modeling, novel data aggregation techniques, data mining, etc.

2.    OBJECTIVES

The primary objective of this solicitation is to encourage researchers to generate novel cancer research findings by mining the  rich  data  sets
currently available without access restrictions to the cancer community and by leveraging caBIG tools and infrastructure  as  well  as  the  wide
array of data sets and tools available from the broader biomedical informatics and research  communities.   Hence,  this  solicitation  is  aimed
primarily at bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and statisticians who are asking key biologic and medical research questions  that  can
be addressed through data mining, analysis and the integration of the wide array of disparate datasets.

The scientific goals of the ISRCE will be to:
    • generate publishable novel research findings through integrating, analyzing and/or mining the data  accessible  through  caGrid  and  other
      publicly available data sources;
    • identify novel processes (including workflows) and tools that exploit these data resources by supporting the analysis of data generated  by
      early phase clinical and basic research studies;
    • develop and make publicly available new data analysis, aggregation and mining algorithms capable of  working  with  disparate,  potentially
      distributed data resources;
    • encourage availability of additional data resources and analytic services that will be useful for biomedical research; and
    • assess the capacity of current publicly available data resources to support  cancer research through:
         - discovery of non-obvious relationships
         - determination of missing key attributes and links that could enhance analysis.

Offerors are advised that this solicitation is not issued for the purpose of generating new experimental data, either of a clinical or a non-
clinical nature, but rather to promote the derivation of novel research findings from the use of existing experimental (and other) data.

3.    SCOPE OF WORK

The ISRCEs will be funded to perform in silico, hypothesis-driven research using data analysis, aggregation and mining focused  on  discovery  by
using caBIG and other publicly available data resources.  Each Center is expected to generate:
         • scientific discoveries reported in white papers, peer-reviewed publications and scientific meetings;
         • new methods, analytics, data, and analysis results that are developed in the course of performing research and that support  research
           outcomes; and
         • gap analyses that address the capacity of publicly available data resources, both caGrid-enabled and non-caGrid enabled   to  support
           basic and clinical cancer research.

The Centers must be structured to be scalable and ultimately engaged in multiple lines of investigation.  It is envisioned that the Centers  will
initially contain core in silico research teams  consisting  of  a  director,  who  is  a  senior  professional  bioinformatician,  computational
biologist, or statistician (“ISRCE Director”), and several junior professional staff.  The ISRCE Director must  be  established  in  his  or  her
field and have documented  experience  in  applying  bioinformatics  to  key  research  questions.   The  core  staff  must  have  competency  in
bioinformatics, cheminformatics, statistics, and/ or computational  biology  as  applied  to  the  genomics,  proteomics,  chemistry,  population
sciences, and/or image analysis of cancer and the demonstrated ability to rapidly master new tools.  The ISRCE Director and other members of  the
core staff will be expected to contribute and pursue at least one novel,  investigator-initiated  line  of  in  silico  investigation  (“research
investigation”) as part of the initial funding.

The Center will also be responsible for: providing the deliverables described below; organizing additional  research  efforts;  participating  in
the ISRCE Consortium activities (described below); maintaining a local caGrid node; and other tasks described in this solicitation.

It is further envisioned that with time (potentially including within the base period),  each  ISRCE  will  develop  a  portfolio  of  additional
research investigations.  Therefore, a successful Offeror must propose a vision for an in silico research program, of which  the  first  research
investigation is well defined pursuant to Task 4 below.  Additional investigations falling within the scope of  the  Offeror’s  research  program
may be proposed during the period of performance, so that the composition of the Center’s research portfolio may fluctuate  over  time.   As  new
research investigations are undertaken, collaborations between an ISRCE’s core staff and other researchers may take place and are encouraged.

4.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION


2     4.1   Overview



      The goal of establishing in silico Research Centers (“ISRCE”) is to empower in silico  research,  in  which  the  rich  datasets  currently
      available to the cancer community are analyzed to produce novel discoveries.  The  ISRCE  will  perform  integrative  data  analysis  using
      heterogeneous and distributed resources to advance the  understanding  of  cancer  etiology,  detection,  treatment  and  prevention.   The
      techniques and resources employed are likely to include the whole range of tools available  to  bioinformatics  researchers,  ranging  from
      desktop tools, to scripting languages such as Perl, Python, ruby, to statistical analysis  packages  such  as  “R”  and  many  others.   By
      leveraging caBIG-tools, along with other available resources, a broad range of capabilities are enabled in support of in  silico  research.
      Potential studies include, but are not limited to:

         • Deep integrative analyses to identify biomarkers predictive of risk in a study population,  for  example,  by  mining  of  TCGA  data
           resources (see “Data Resources” below)
         • Investigations of phenotype- genotype correlations through analyzing,  filtering  and  integrating  imaging,  SNP,  gene  expression,
           proteomic and clinical data for classification
         • Identification of mutation patterns common to diverse types of cancer.

      ISRCE shall be led and staffed by in silico research teams composed of biomedical researchers, bioinformaticians, computational biologists,
      statisticians and other computational scientists with a strong research interest in cancer.  While collaboration with  basic  and  clinical
      researchers is encouraged, the ISRCE shall be directed by in silico researchers and the  proposed  research  investigations  shall  have  a
      primarily in silico focus.


      The objective of the initial and subsequent studies shall be clearly defined and the data sets, methods, and analyses used to support these
      objectives must be articulated.  ISRCE are encouraged to mine the rich data sets  currently  available  (see  “NCI-hosted  Data  Resources”
      below) and integrate their own data sets as appropriate.  Integration, analysis and interpretation projects  shall  leverage  but  are  not
      limited to the use of data resources generated with caBIG-compatible tools, and infrastructure (see “Research Resources” below).   Offerors
      are also encouraged to identify and use data and tools not currently maintained as caBIG or other public data resources;  these  additional
      tools and datasets should be described in the data sharing plans accompanying Offerors’ technical proposals.


      As described below, a research plan for each proposed research investigation shall be prepared and approved by  the  SAIC  COTR  before  an
      ISRCE undertakes a proposed project.  Research plans will be evaluated by a review panel of subject matter experts.


      4.2   ISRCE Consortium Infrastructure


      To foster in silico research and to provide a platform for access, communication, collaborative documentation, upload, and distribution  of
      data, tools, analyses, and workflows, NCI will provide a supporting infrastructure in order to aggregate and simplify access to  resources.
      Successful applicants are expected to make use  of  the  provided  ISRCE  wiki,  forum,  and  data  repository  platforms  as  a  means  of
      communicating, documenting, sharing, and distributing analysis tools, workflows, results and associated context discussions.  The intent is
      to connect research results to the data and the tools used for the analysis.


      It is envisioned that the ISRCEs will function as a consortium with coordination and oversight by NCI-appointed program staff.  ISRCEs will
      be able to share experience and results during regularly scheduled teleconferences and  through  the  NCI-provided  wiki,  forum  and  data
      repository platforms.  Participation in the ISRCE Consortium will allow members to:


            • identify opportunities for, and participate  in,  cross-ISRCE  integrative  data  analyses  using  heterogeneous  and  distributed
              resources
            • share data and analysis methods with collaborators and members of the Consortium
            • help to establish common sets of services, data sources, workflows, vocabularies, common data elements and data models  to  enable
              the further integration of analysis results


      It is hoped that participation in the ISRCE Consortium will encourage and facilitate a highly interactive community from which a  group  of
      mutually supportive in silico analysts will emerge.  The desired  outcome  is  strengthened  collaborative  ties  and  new  and  unexpected
      opportunities for synergistic discovery by Consortium members through discussion, annotation and potential incorporation  of  data,  tools,
      and workflows.  It is anticipated that algorithms, models and simulations, tools, workflows,  data,  and  knowledge  derived  from  ongoing
      research will be made available by individual ISRCEs through their caGrid nodes in order to support cross-study comparison and integration.


      4.3   Research Resources


      Offerors are encouraged to use public data resources, including data sets generated with caBIG-compatible tools and infrastructure, as well
      as other data and tools subject to their own or third party control (“research resources”).

2 4.3.2     Other Data and Research Resources



           Offerors are encouraged to propose other data sets for analysis in ISRCE research investigations, including data  sets  generated  by
           ISRCE core staff, current or prospective research collaborators, other government agencies, and  other  publicly  available  sources.
           Such other data sets shall be entered into the appropriate  caBIG  repository  or  shall  be  made  available  via  a  caGrid-enabled
           application in accordance with the terms of Offeror’s data sharing plan, as described below.


           Offerors are also encouraged to apply their own tools to the analysis of NCI-hosted or other data resources.  These tools  should  be
           fully described their terms of use by the broader biomedical research community  specified  in  the  Offerors’  data  sharing  plans.
           Offerors may request funding to share such research resources through  the  caBIG  infrastructure  and  to  develop  caBIG-compatible
           application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for tools and  other  resources  that  are  not  currently  caBIG-compatible.   As  ISRCE
           participants continue to annotate and make available new data resources, research tools, analysis workflows and results  through  the
           ISRCE Consortium infrastructure, they will provide the basis for expanded and synergistic research opportunities.


           Although the development of new analytical tools is not the  purpose  of  this  subcontract,  any  tools  developed  incidentally  in
           connection with ISRCE activities will be subject to the terms of the Offeror’s data sharing plan and other terms of this subcontract.


           Commercial, off-the-shelf software may be used in the proposed work.  The use of commercial software shall be noted and justified  in

2  Participate in ISRCE Consortium Activities

To foster in silico research and to provide a platform for access, communication, and collaboration a supporting infrastructure will be  provided
by the NCI.  The successful Offeror is expected to make use of the provided ISRCE wiki, forum, and any common provided data repository  platforms
as a means of communicating, documenting, and sharing knowledge gained from the ISRCE research.  ISRCE participants  shall  attend  and  actively
participate in regularly scheduled teleconferences and Consortium meetings.  The meetings will be primarily scientific  in  nature  during  which
the work of the participants shall be discussed and reviewed.  For the purpose of budgeting, ISRCE shall plan on preparation for  and  travel  to
two caBIG-sponsored meetings per year at which ISRCE activities and results will be presented and discussed.

3  Develop Data Sharing Plan

Each Offeror shall submit as part of its Technical Proposal a draft data sharing plan specifying the research resources and research products  to
be shared that describes the timing and mechanisms by which the Offeror will make available both any research resources  that  are  not  publicly
available as well as any resulting research products.  As described in the Section M – Evaluation Factors for Award, adequacy of the  draft  data
sharing plan will be considered when proposals are scored.  Successful Offerors will have their data sharing plan reviewed by  the  SAIC-F  COTR,
NCI PO and the caBIG Data Sharing and Intellectual Capital (DSIC) Workspace Facilitator; comments  shall  be  incorporated  and  the  final  data
sharing plan provided within 90 days of subcontract award date.  The final data sharing plan, as may be revised during  the  negotiation  process
between the Offeror and the SAIC-F COTR, shall become a term and condition of the awarded subcontract.  The  final  data  sharing  plan  will  be
further revised from time to time as needed in order to reflect research resources and research  products  associated  with  subsequent  research
investigations, as contemplated in Tasks 4, 5, and 6.

All research resources that are used in research investigations proposed by  Offerors  must  be  generated  from  ongoing  or  completed  studies
developed outside the work performed under this contract.  All  research  resources  and  research  products  shall  be  made  available  to  the
Government and the public pursuant to the terms set forth in Article H.8.B and in accordance with the terms of the Offeror’s data sharing plan.

The data sharing plan shall detail the specific government and public rights of each research product to be made available.  The Government  must
have the maximum rights to distribute the research findings, analysis results and other data produced  under  this  subcontract  subject  to  the
limitations of federal laws and regulations concerning privacy and the conduct of research, including human subjects research  protections.   Any
data resources that are subject to restricted access conditions are considered “Proprietary Technical Data”  under  Article  H.8.A  and  must  be
explicitly described.  Offerors that plan to use proprietary data resources must obtain prior written  permission  from  the  SAIC-F  Contracting
Officer unless the Offeror can provide written assurance that any  research findings, analysis results or other data  derived  from  the  use  of
such proprietary data resources can be disseminated without restriction (except for  privacy,  human  subjects  protection  or  other  regulatory
reasons).  The data sharing plan must also provide that if the Offeror  and/or  its  collaborators  file  patent  applications  on  any  research
products delivered under the subcontract, they agree that they will permit any  research  products  covered  by  patent  applications  or  issued
patents to be used for research or educational purposes by the  public  without  charge  under  terms  that  are  consistent  with  the  National
Institutes of Health (NIH) Principles for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts on  Obtaining  and  Disseminating  Biomedical  Research
Resources, 64 Fed. Reg. 72090 (Dec. 23, 1999).

Any research findings, analysis tools, results, and/or other data generated through the conduct of the research under  this  subcontract  may  be
made available through a caBIG-compliant interface and include a description of the scientific study represented, the number of  samples  in  the
study (if applicable), and other relevant information.  The Offeror shall also include a plan for maintaining such datasets.

In addition, the Offeror’s data sharing plan shall specify:

    ▪ the terms of use, including any restrictions on access or distribution, by the  broader  biomedical  research  community  of  any  research
      resources proposed for use, and if applicable, when such resources will be publicly available without restrictions on use

    ▪ when research products, including data sets and any tools developed in the course  of  conducting  research,  will  be  publicly  available
      without restrictions on use

    ▪ whether data sets and tools (either research resources or research products) will be entered  into  the  appropriate  caBIG  repository  or
      made available via a caGrid-enabled application.

In preparing their data sharing plans, Offerors shall use the caBIG Data Sharing and Security Framework  (DSSF)  to  assess  the  sensitivity  of
proposed research resources and any expected research products and then describe any access conditions, including any requirements for  data  use
agreements.  For more information on the DSSF, please refer to the Data Sharing and Security Framework (DSSF) Web-cast Materials  (available  at:
https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/working_groups/DSIC_SLWG/DSSF_Webcast).

The Offeror is responsible for obtaining all permissions or approvals required to provide access or distribute any nonpublic  research  resources
in order to comply with the undertakings of the data sharing plan.  The Offeror must:

    ▪ provide documentary support for such permission from research collaborators not affiliated with the proposed ISRCE, regardless  of  whether
      such collaborators are affiliated with the institution(s) at which the ISRCE is located; and


    ▪ specify the steps and dates for any required  approvals  to  share  research  resources  or  research  products  from  IRBs  or  any  other
      institutional bodies, and supply documentation of such approvals within 180 days of the contract award date.

For purposes of obtaining such approvals, the Offeror may wish to consult the caBIG Guidelines for Preparing Data Sharing  Plans  established  by
NCI-CBIIT through the caBIG Data Sharing and Intellectual Capital (DSIC) Workspace.  The Guidelines are available on-line at
https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/working_groups/DSIC_SLWG/Documents/caBIG_Data_Sharing_Plan_Guideline_20080109.pdf.  For  more   information   regarding
preparation of data and research resources sharing plans,  the offeror may  also  present  questions  through  the  DSIC  Knowledge  Center  WIKI
(https://cabig-kc.nci.nih.gov/DSIC/KC).

As new research investigations are proposed and accepted, the offeror shall amend the data  sharing  plan  and  obtain  any  necessary  approvals
within timeframes described above.

4  Develop Research Plans

The Offeror shall prepare a research plan for each project planned for the base period of the award  that  is  consistent  with  the  quality  of
research plans submitted with NIH grant applications.  The research plan shall detail the specific hypothesis and goals of the research, as  well
as expected outcomes.  The plan shall detail the significance of the proposed research and the anticipated impact  on  the  knowledge  of  cancer
mechanisms or outcomes.

The research design shall be presented, including the caBIG and other data sources and tools to be used to conduct the research.   Expected  data
mining and other methodologies shall be detailed.

Each research plan shall also describe the anticipated research products.  Anticipated products include but are not limited to the following;

    • Algorithms
    • Models and Simulations
    • Tools
    • New Workflows and Processes
    • Data
    • Research Findings/ Analysis Results and New Knowledge gained from this Research

The research plan must describe, in accordance with the initial data sharing plan, the specific way in  which  each  research  product  generated
pursuant to Task 6) will be made publicly available and the ISRCE’s data sharing plan should be  updated  accordingly.   Research  products  that
lend themselves to caGrid enablement should be disseminated via the caGrid infrastructure.

The Offeror should expect to propose additional lines of research during the performance of the subcontract.  A research plan for  each  proposed
research investigation shall be prepared and approved by the SAIC COTR before an ISRCE undertakes the project.

5  Conduct Research

The ISRCE team shall conduct research that is described in the approved project research plans.   All risks identified  in  the  Management  Plan
and individual Research Plans (e.g. inability to access a planned data resource) shall be monitored and any that reach a critical level shall  be
brought immediately to the attention of the SAIC-F COTR.

Research teams shall consist of biomedical/bioinformatics researchers but may be assisted by IT personnel if needed in order  to  help  implement
any needed IT infrastructure such as grid nodes and distributed data access.

Collaborations with researchers outside of the ISRCE institution, with other ISRCEs, and at NCI-funded Cancer Centers are encouraged.

6  Develop Research Report and Products

In the course of conducting such research, it is anticipated that new research products such  as  algorithms,  clients  for  accessing  data  and
services, processes, and other artifacts will be developed.  A goal of this solicitation is to make these  research  products  available  to  the
general bioinformatics and cancer research communities.  A wide variety of research products may be developed, including but not limited to:

    ▪ Algorithms.  In the course of either data mining or hypothesis-driven in silico research, algorithms  for  discovering  previously  unknown
      relationships in data resources may be developed.   In these cases, the specific algorithm(s) that was used should be  documented  and  the
      relevant documentation and accompanying source code made available by posting to the appropriate forum as described  in  the  research  and
      data sharing plans and approved by the SAIC-F COTR.  When relevant, such algorithms can be made available as caGrid analytical services.
    ▪ Models and Simulations. Models and simulations developed to support  research  should  be  documented,  both  in  terms  of  the  model  or
      simulation fidelity and content, and in terms of their use or potential for reuse.  Simulation or model source code developed in the course
      of research should be posted to the appropriate forum as described in the research and data sharing plans and approved by the SAIC-F  COTR.
      Simulations and models may also be made available as caGrid analytical services.
    ▪ Tools. Examples of tools include portals, user interfaces, clients,  data  aggregation  and  distributed  data  access  routines,  and  any
      general purpose software developed in the course of performing in  silico  research  that  would  be  of  general  benefit  to  the  cancer
      bioinformatics research community.  Any tools developed as research products need to include high level  user  guides  and  shall  be  made
      available, at a minimum, as a reference implementation posted to the appropriate forum as described in the research and data sharing  plans
      and approved by the SAIC-F COTR.  .
    ▪ Workflows and Processes. In order to perform the proposed research, novel processes may be developed that  require  coordinated  sequencing
      of data access and service of function invocations.  If these workflows are deemed to be reusable by the general bioinformatics  community,
      they should be documented and posted to the appropriate forum as described in the research and data sharing plans and approved by the SAIC-
      F COTR.  If applicable, it is preferred that Taverna or Gene Pattern workflows be constructed consistent with  caBIG  standards.  Workflows
      should be deposited to appropriate web resources; deposition with the myExperiment project (http://www.myexperiment.org) is encouraged.
    ▪ Research Findings, Analysis Results and Other Research Data. All research data generated by ISRCEs in the course of  performing  in  silico
      research should be made publicly available, consistent with the Offeror’s data sharing plan, through peer-reviewed publications as well  as
      through posting to the appropriate forum as described in the research and data sharing plans and approved by the SAIC-F COTR.

           shall be accompanied by documentation explaining the product, its function, its intended use, and  how  it  is  to  be  accessed  and
           operated or employed by an end-user.  This documentation shall be consistent with the product  descriptions  in  the  Research  Plan.
           Product documentation will be accepted if it contains this information in sufficient detail for a  bioinformatician  with  experience
           comparable to the intended end user to be able to devise a test and user acceptance plan using this information.  Acceptance for  all
           products will be contingent on acceptance of product documentation as described here, the posting of that  product  to  its  publicly
           available web resource as described in the research and data sharing plans,  and  successful  functional  and  user  testing  of  the
           function and features described in the product documentation.

           5 6.2.4.    Deliverable Review and Acceptance Process



           For all deliverables, the SAIC-F COTR will perform an evaluation for each  deliverable  using  acceptance  criteria  provided  above.
           Approval/rejection notice will be sent to the successful Offeror  within  30  calendar  days  of  receipt  of  the  deliverable.   If
           deliverables meet the acceptance criteria, the SAIC-F Contracting Officer will issue the  successful  Offeror  a  written  acceptance
           through email that acknowledges both receipt and overall acceptance of the deliverable.  Irrespective of payment status  for  subject
           deliverable, successful Offeror shall not assume acceptance has been made without formal notification  from  the  SAIC-F  Contracting
           Officer.  If deliverables do not meet the acceptance criteria, all issues will be described unambiguously and sent to the  successful
           Offeror via email.  The successful Offeror will then address each issue or state why the issue may not be addressed and resubmit  the
           deliverable.  Resubmitted deliverables will be reviewed within 15 calendar days.


           Absence of any comments by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer will not relieve the successful Offeror of the responsibility for complying
           with requirements in this statement of work.  Final approval and acceptance of documentation required herein shall be  by  letter  of
           approval from the SAIC-F Contracting Officer.  The successful Offeror shall not construe any letter of acknowledgment of  receipt  of
           deliverable as a waiver of review or as an acknowledgment that the deliverable is in conformance with the overall requirement.
