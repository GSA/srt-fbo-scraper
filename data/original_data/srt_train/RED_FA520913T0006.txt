(a) The Government will award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced offeror with acceptable past performance. (1) Price Evaluation for Award: For award purposes, the total evaluated price for each offeror will be evaluated based on the total offered price. (2) Past Performance:

(i) The Government will evaluate past performance information submitted from the lowest priced offeror under this acquisition. In the event that the lowest offeror fails to meet Government past performance acceptability standard as defined in below, the offeror will be eliminated from consideration for award and the Government will then evaluate the next low offeror's past performance. This process will continue until an offeror is found to have acceptable past performance. (ii) Offerors shall submit the most recent and relevant past and present contracts and subcontracts performed for the U.S. Government, the Government of Japan or political subdivisions and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. Past performance will be evaluated for recency, relevancy, and quality. The Contracting Officer shall evaluate /past performance information based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance on relevant contracts. Past performance

FA5209-13-T-0006 Page 15 of 21 regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. Offerors with no relevant past performance history are treated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, the Government may use information obtained from other sources to determine a final past performance rating. Past performance evaluation will be performed based on the following criteria: (A) Recency: The Government will confirm whether contracts submitted by the offeror has been completed within the past 3 years from the solicitation release date or are currently in progress. (B) Relevancy: The Government will evaluate contracts submitted by the offeror to determine relevancy. Relevancy is defined as similar services when compared to this solicitation in terms of actual services provided. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. (C) Quality: The Government will evaluate contracts submitted by the offeror to determine whether performance met or exceeded contractual requirements with few or no minor problems. (iii) Final Past Performance Rating: acceptable or unacceptable rating as follows: Based on evaluation results, the low offeror will be assigned either

Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort or the offeror's performance record is unknown. Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. (iv) The offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts identified in their Past Performance Reference List and corrective actions taken to resolve these problems. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
