Hydrologic Engineering Analysis, Engineering Modeling, and Studies for the Hydrologic Engineering Center (CEIWR-HEC) Davis, California 1. Introduction and Background The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) performs special projects and research, develops software, presents training courses and workshops, and provides technical assistance to Corps field offices, HQUSACE, and Laboratories in support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program. HEC also provides support services to USACE and US Government international missions. In carrying out the HEC mission, a wide variety of hydrologic and hydraulic engineering modeling, analysis, software enhancements, and water resources studies and projects are performed. These support activities may be performed for HEC special projects, research and development, technical assistance, or training activities, undertaken as a service to Corps field offices or headquarters, or may be conducted in support of work being performed for U.S. Federal agencies or other organizations with which the Corps has agreements. These activities may be conducted in: 1) Surface water hydrology (rainfall-runoff/snow-melt analysis, flood hydrograph analysis, seepage and infiltration); 2) Water quality (river-reservoir water quality analysis, land surface wash off); 3) Reservoir systems (water resources planning and management, multi-purpose reservoir operations, storage-yield analysis, reservoir system simulations); 4) Planning analysis (flood risk management, economic analyses, plan formulation/evaluation, project performance, risk-based analysis, population at risk estimation, loss of life estimation, and reservoir system optimization); 5) Fluvial hydraulics (steady and unsteady one-dimensional river hydraulics, 2-dimensional river hydraulics, river/reservoir sediment transport, floodplain delineation, dam and levee risk assessments); 6) Statistics (flood and low-flow frequency analysis, flow-duration studies, regression analysis); 7) Water control management (real-time data acquisition and management, flood/stage forecasting, water management system operation, economic impact analysis); 8) Ecosystem modeling (hydrologic, hydraulic, statistical, and geospatial analyses for riverine and wetlands sustainability) 9) Groundwater hydrology (infiltration and seepage, pump/treat analysis, well field simulation, groundwater-surface water interaction); and 10) Geographic information systems for hydrologic and hydraulic engineering and planning analysis. HEC computer software such as HEC-RAS and GeoRAS, HEC-HMS and GeoHMS, HEC-FDA and HEC-FIA, HEC-5/5Q, HEC-ResSim, HEC-FFA, HEC-SSP, HEC-DSS and HEC-DSSVue, HEC-EFM and HEC-GeoEFM, HEC-RPT, CWMS, HEC-RTS, LifeSim and perhaps models developed by others, would normally be used in the hydrologic and hydraulic engineering and planning studies. New software such as HEC-WAT with its Flood Risk Analysis compute option is also expected to be used. Performance of hydrologic and hydraulic engineering and planning analysis, modeling, and studies may include: 1) 2) 3) 4) Project coordination Data compilation, Data analysis, Geospatial data processing, 5) 6) 7) 8) Computer model data preparation and calibration, Model applications and results interpretation, Geospatial mapping of results, and Study documentation.

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 7 of 65

HEC software development may include researching current state of the art methodologies, comparing methodologies, algorithm development, code development, development of scripts, software testing, fixing bugs, and documenting software capabilities and usage. 2. Performance Work Statement Under this contract, the Contractor shall undertake hydrologic and hydraulic engineering and planning analysis, modeling, training, studies as specific tasks, and development of hydrologic and hydraulic engineering and planning software tools. Task orders will be issued defining the specific hydrologic and hydraulic engineering or planning analysis, and/or software development activity to be undertaken and product to be delivered. For each task, the Contractor may be required to travel to the field site (anywhere in the U.S. or internationally) for project coordination, data collection, site inspection, and results presentation. They may work on-site at HEC as a member of a study team, working together with HEC staff and possibly other contractors; or may perform all or most of the work in their offices; with each circumstance depending on the specific activity to be performed. Typical tasks might include: a. Develop an HEC-RAS unsteady flow model of river systems based on digital elevation data supplemented with available surveyed cross-sectional data, high water marks, and published flood plain studies. Apply the model to estimate the water surface elevations along the river system for several hypothetical floods, and prepare a report that presents results. b. Compile rainfall-runoff data and estimate the parameters using GIS methods for an HEC-HMS catchment model. Use the model to evaluate the performance of several alternative detention basin sizes and locations, and present the results as a series of flood frequency curves. Present the results at Corps in-house meeting at customer Districts. c. Perform flow-frequency analysis in support of a study to reallocate storage in an existing reservoir. Frequency analysis would be performed for without reservoir regulation conditions, and with several alternative regulation strategies. Further, drought frequency studies would be performed for the same sets of conditions to quantify the effects of the reallocation alternatives on low flows in the system. Document data collection, analysis, and results. d. Perform risk analysis of a non-Corps levee considering flow, stage, and geotechnical uncertainties. Follow-up with conditional probability analysis to determine appropriateness for FEMA floodplain management certification of the levee. Document data, analysis, and results in technical report. e. Assist with development of Corps Water Management System (CWMS) models for USACE Districts for real-time forecasting and decision support analysis. Models may include HEC-HMS set up for NEXRAD radar analysis, HEC-RAS for navigation lock and dam operation, HECResSim for flood and in-stream endangered species operations, and GIS/digital terrain for automated flood inundation mapping, and HEC-FIA for flood impact analysis and benefits attributed to flood control projects. Assist with model integration into CWMS, local training, and follow-up support. f. Develop a reservoir system model of a study watershed for a daily time-step period-of-record hydropower and low flow analysis-using HEC-ResSim. Perform studies to determine the power and stream flow impact of revised operation to favor downstream environmental restoration. Participate with Corps representatives at public meetings

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 12 of 65

NOTES: 1. The Pricing Schedule contains the fully burden labor rates for both the prime Contractor and any subContractor. The hourly rates in the Pricing Schedule are firm-fixed prices. These firm-fixed prices will govern regardless of the quantities ordered under any subsequent task order over the life of the IDIQ. All costs are accounted for (e.g., direct labor, all indirect costs, profit, subcontractor's profit, the prime's markup to subcontractor's fully burdened rates, etc.) in the proposed fully burdened labor rates. 2. The job classifications noted in the Pricing Schedule are the Government's anticipated job classifications. Offeror must include these classifications through their own firm or through subcontractors to be used over the life of the IDIQ. The Government intends to pre-price all direct costs to the maximum extent possible. All Other Direct Costs anticipated over the life of the IDIQ (except equipment, material and supply) include as other Direct Costs only those that are consistent with the firm's accounting system and those that are not already accounted for in the indirect cost rates. 3. Air Fare, Lodging, Per Diem, and Vehicle Rental/Mileage Costs: If required by a Task, cost for travel, lodging, meals, vehicle rental, and mileage are allowable subject to the limitations of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-46. These costs will be negotiated on each Task Order. The Contractor is allowed to apply indirect costs as proposed to travel costs. Every invoice shall be accompanied by a full accounting including proper supporting documentation (e.g., receipt for expenditures of $75.00 or more; purpose/itinerary of trip, etc.) for any travel related costs. 4. Lump Sum Task Orders: Firm-fixed-price Task Orders will be negotiated based on the projected level of effort required to complete the work utilizing the unit prices establish in the Pricing Schedule. Each Task Order will be issued on a firm-fixed ("lump sum") basis. After acceptance of the Order by the contractor, the Task order price will not be adjusted to reflect the actual labor hours/quantities, including other direct costs, utilized by the Contractor in the performance of the work. The price will only be adjusted to reflect changes in scope or conditions governed by other contract clauses (e.g., Changes clause, etc.). 6. Reserved 7. Supplemental Pricing Information: Supplemental pricing information (e.g., "other than cost or pricing data") is required as follows: Identify any costs included in your quotation associated with proposed subcontracting and provide an explanation of how it was determined that the prices proposed by the prospective subcontractor(s) are fair and reasonable. If profit is not included as part of fully burdened hourly labor or other direct cost rates, address proposed profit separately. If profit is included in the fully burdened hourly labor or other direct cost rates, provide the percentage of profit utilized. The supplemental pricing information is required for price evaluation purposes only and will not be incorporated into the purchase order. Evaluation Of Submitted Offers: Your proposal will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Qualifications, Organizational Experience, Past Performance and Price. Key Personnel

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 13 of 65

Your technical proposal will be evaluated to determine your understanding of the work requirements and the qualifications of your organization, to include the proposed technical lead(s), based on successful completion of work similar to the work that will be required under the prospective IDIQ. The contractor's likelihood of success as evidenced by the technical proposal (e.g., "proposal risk,") will also be a consideration in the evaluation of the technical proposal. In its evaluation of contractor's past performance, the Government may use information furnished by the references identified in the contractor's technical proposal and recent, relevant information available to the Government from other sources, to include Government databases. Contractors will be given the opportunity to comment on any negative past performance information received. Your price quotation will be analyzed for reasonableness and unbalanced pricing. The price quotation may also be analyzed to determine whether it is realistic for the work to be performed and reflects a clear understanding of the Government's requirements. Past Performance and Technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. (End of Section)

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 23 of 65

(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: The government expects to award up to three (3) firm fixed-price IDIQ contracts to the contractor(s) whose proposal(s) represent the best value to Government, price and other factors considered. Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Key Personnel Qualifications, Organizational Experience, Past Performance and Price. The technical proposal will be evaluated to determine your understanding of the work requirements and the qualifications of your organization, to include the proposed technical lead(s), based on suxccessful completion of work similar to the work that will be required under the prospective IDIQ. The contractor's likelihood of success as evidenced by the technical proposal (e.g., "proposal risk,") will also be a consideration in the evaluation of the technical proposal. In its evaluation of contractor's past performance, the Government may use information furnished by the references identified in the contractor's technical proposal and recent, relevant information available to the Government from other sources, to include Government databases. Contractors will be given the opportunity to comment on any negative past performance information received. Your price quotation will be analyzed for reasonableness and unbalanced pricing. The price quotation may also be analyzed to determine whether it is realistic for the work to be performed and reflects a clear understanding of the Government's requirements. Past Performance and Technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 26 of 65 either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 35 of 65 falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 44 of 65 (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

W91238-13-Q-0047 Page 51 of 65 Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards. (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it ( ) is, ( ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 541330- assigned to contract number W91238-13-Q-0047.

ADJECTIVE RATINGS AND DEFINITIONS TO BE USED TO BEST REFLECT YOUR EVALUATION OF THE CONTRACTOR'S PERFORMANCE

RATING
(E) Exceptional

DEFINITION
Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government/Owner's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor was highly effective.

NOTE
An Exceptional rating is appropriate when the Contractor successfully performed multiple significant events that were of benefit to the Government/Owner. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it alone constitutes an Exceptional rating. Also, there should have been NO significant weaknesses identified. A Very Good rating is appropriate when the Contractor successfully performed a significant event that was a benefit to the Government/Owner. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified.

(VG) Very Good

(S) Satisfactory

Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's/Owner's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. Performance meets minimum contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.

(M) Marginal

(U) Unsatisfactory

Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

A Satisfactory rating is appropriate when there were only minor problems, or major problems that the contractor recovered from without impact to the contract. There should have been NO significant weaknesses identified. Per DOD policy, a fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractors will not be assessed a rating lower than Satisfactory solely for not performing beyond the requirements of the contract. A Marginal is appropriate when a significant event occurred that the contractor had trouble overcoming which impacted the Government/Owner.

(N) Not Applicable

No information or did not apply to your contract

An Unsatisfactory rating is appropriate when multiple significant events occurred that the contractor had trouble overcoming and which impacted the Government/Owner. A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an unsatisfactory rating. Rating will be neither positive nor negative.
