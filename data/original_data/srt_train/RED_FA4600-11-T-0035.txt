Performance Work Statement AFWA Global Lightning Data

1.0 Description of requirement. Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska requires delivery of global lightning observation data. 2.0 Scope of Requirement. AFWA has the following requirements for streaming lightning data: 2.0.1 Cloud to Ground (CG) and Cloud to Cloud (CF) lightning data. The United States Air Force has a base requirement for global lightning data that includes 26 zones (see Table 1). 2.0.2 AFWA requires that the vendor's lightning detection network operate and transmit data to AFWA 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Any failure of either the detection network or of the vendor's communication system that results in a loss of availability is defined as a system outage. Network availability is required to be at 98% or better in each zone. 2.0.3 AFWA requires that the vendor provide uninterrupted data flow, communications and data distribution. 2.0.4 AFWA requires the vendor to verify that lightning data it provides to the United States Air Force meets AF lightning data technical requirements. 2.0.5 AFWA requires the ability to freely distribute government-generated products that contain lightning data to any participating Federal agency, contractors supporting the agency on an active contract, and to cooperating state and local government agencies at no additional cost, as long as the vendor's raw data is not available to unauthorized users. 2.0.6 AFWA requires the ability to use the Internet to distribute lighting data and products to authorized users. Authorized users means any person/organization that the government has authorized to receive the data in question to include other government's agencies (for example, UK meteorological organizations), other military agencies (for example, US Navy, US Army), and research facilities to whom AFWA provides data. These data and products will be distributed in a secure manner to prevent unauthorized access; and the data will not be released outside of the authorized AFWA user community. Data products derived from the vendor's raw data will not allow the user community to view the raw data on which the product is based (ex. AFWA's JAAWIN will display where the lightning strike is located on a map, but anyone viewing that map will not be able to interrogate the plot point for the raw data used to make the map display).

Delivery Requirements (CDRLS)

3.0.1 The Contractor shall deliver the lightning data in a streaming ASCII text or XML format. 3.0.2 Data Stream. 3.0.2.1 The data stream shall include date-time (UTC) to thousands of a second, latitude (deg) and longitude (deg) (to thousandths), signal strength (ka), polarity, multiplicity (#strokes/flash), and the number of sensors used to collect the data. 3.0.2.2 The data stream shall be provided in Stroke format. 3.0.2.3 Transition Plan--KTR shall provide a plan to demonstrate its ability to integrate the contractors's data feed with AFWA's software to ensure a seamless transition. The data stream shall be flowing within 30 days of contract award. 3.0.3 The data shall be encrypted as it is transmitted to prevent unauthorized receivers from using the data. 3.0.4 The data shall be delivered to AFWA through the internet as the primary transmission method. (CDRL A001) 3.0.5 The data shall be delivered to AFWA in four data feeds as follows: production primary, production backup, development primary, development backup. 3.0.6 The data shall be delivered to AFWA 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Contractor shall notify AFWA when the data flow has been compromised (ex. sensors are down causing gaps in the data, network issues that prevent the delivery of data, etc). 3.0.7 Outages 3.0.7.1 Network availability shall be 98% or higher in each month of the period of performance. The network shall be down no more than 12 hours in any month. The calculations used are based on an average 28 day month and are listed below. 28 days/mon * 24 hours/day = 672 hours/month. 660 hours network up / 672 hours/mo = 98% uptime 672 hours/mo ­ 660 hours uptime = 12 hours downtime/month. 3.0.7.2 Data availability shall be 98% or higher in each month of the period of performance for each data zone. The data shall be unavailable no more than 12 hours in any month for any data zone. The calculations Page 2 of 22

used are based on an average 28 day month and are listed below. 28 days/mon * 24 hours/day = 672 hours/month. 660 hours data flowing / 672 hours/mo = 98% uptime 672 hours/mo ­ 660 data flowing = 12 hours data unavailable/month. Data availability is only affected if there are not enough sensors to cover a given zone. Having one sensor unable to provide data in a given zone will not have an impact, if there are other sensors that adequately cover the zone and provide the data for that zone. 3.0.8 Help Desk The contractor shall provide troubleshooting/technical support for the global lightning data feeds. The Help Desk shall field service requests from operational squadrons made through the Customer Support Center (CSC) located at Offutt Air Force Base. The Help Desk shall respond to all service calls 365 days a year, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day and shall make an initial response to all service requests within ten (10) hours of receiving the service call from the CSC. The number of in-bound calls made for technical assistance will be unlimited. 4.0 Government Furnished Equipment and Information (GFE/GFI)

4.0.1 Government furnished equipment and information shall not be provided. 4.0.2 Contractor performance will take place at contractor facility. 5.0 Services Summary

____________________________________________________________________________________ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.59 per hour or $143.60 per week or $622.27 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 20 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or

modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.

Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)

(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees. (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show-(1) The solicitation number; (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; (5) Terms of any express warranty; (6) Price and any discount terms; (7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address; (8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically); (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 9 of 42

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers: (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 10 of 42 quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (1) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (2) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (4) A summary of the rationale for award; (5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors ­ Commercial Items 1.0 General Instructions This section of the ITO provides general guidance for preparing proposals as well as specific instructions on the format and content of the proposal. The offeror's proposal must include all data and information requested by the ITO and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions. The offer shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and Solicitation. Non-conformance with the instructions provided in this ITO may result in an unfavorable proposal evaluation. The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet these requirements. Proposals that rephrase or restate the Government's requirements shall be considered unresponsive and technically unacceptable. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offeror's proposal. Offerors are reminded that the Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Page limitations shall be treated as maximums. If exceeded, the excess pages will not be read or considered in the evaluation of the proposal and (for paper copies) will not be returned to the offeror. Excess pages shall be destroyed along with all unsuccessful proposals (see paragraph 3.0). Page limitations may also be placed on responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs). The page limitations for ENs, if any, will be identified in the correspondence forwarding the ENs to the offerors. When both sides of a sheet of paper display printed material, it shall be counted as two pages. Each page shall be counted except cover pages, tables of contents, cross reference matrix, tabs, and glossaries. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches, not including foldouts. Pages shall be single-spaced. Except for the reproduced sections of the solicitation document, the text size shall be no less than 10 point. Use at least 1-inch margins on all sides of each page. Pages shall be numbered sequentially by volume. Page limitations apply to electronic proposals, as well. If there are discrepancies in page counts between paper and electronic volumes, the paper version shall take precedence (e.g., if the paper version of a volume is 51 pages, and the electronic version of the same volume is 48 pages, the Government will treat the volume as having 51 pages). Legible tables, charts, graphs and figures should be used wherever practical to depict organizations, systems and layout, implementation schedules, plans, etc. These displays should be uncomplicated, legible and shall not exceed 11 by 17 inches in size. Foldout pages shall fold entirely within the volume, and count as two pages. Foldout pages may only be used for large tables, charts, graphs, diagrams and schematics, and not for pages of

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 12 of 42 text. For tables, charts, graphs and figures, the text shall be no smaller than 8 point. These limitations shall apply to both electronic and paper proposals.

Offerors should allow sufficient time to obtain a visitor pass and arrive at the Contracting Office PRIOR to the time specified for receipt. Late proposals will be processed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f) Late submission, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.

If mailing, the outside of the envelope or box(es) should be marked as follows: NOTE: TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION ­ SEE FAR 3.104 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 12.0 Volume 1 ­Technical Capability The Technical Capability Volume should be specific and complete. Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important. Your responses will be evaluated against the Technical subfactors defined in 52.212-2 Evaluation ­ Commercial Items. The following are the subfactors in decending order of importance: 12.1 Subfactor 1: The contractor shall demonstrate its ability to provide cloud-to-ground (CG) and cloud-to-cloud (CF) global lightning data in accordance with the specifications in tables 2-4 of the PWS. The contractor shall also provide its statistical information on the Contractor's CG lightning data product by submitting Attachment 3, tables 1-3. In accordance with 1.0, the contractor shall not copy tables 2-4 from the PWS for this information and shall provide sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. Copying information from tables 2-4 from the PWS shall cause the contractor to be considered nonresponsive and technically unacceptable. (NOTE: A contractor may indicate, in the table they fill out, that actual statistics on their systems are not available where applicable for the appropriate zones.) 12.2 Subfactor 2: The contractor shall demonstrate its approach to maintain network and data ability to 98% (IAW PWS 3.0.7.1) monthly or higher with no more than 12 hours of down time during any month in the event of network outage, data delivery problems, sensors down, etc and their plan to restore service during the down time in accordance with 3.0.7 of the PWS. 12.3 Subfactor 3: The contractor shall demonstrate its ability to deliver the data in accordance with the delivery specifications in section 3 of the PWS. 12.4 Subfactor 4: The contractor shall demonstrate its ability to provide Help Desk Support 24 hours a day, seven days a week in accordance with Section 3, paragraph 3.0.8 of the PWS. 12.5 Subfactor 5:

IAW PWS Appendix A: Coverage Area Maps (NOTE: A contractor may indicate, on the coverage charts they provide, that actual statistics on their systems are not available and they are unable to provide the coverage maps; where applicable, for the appropriate zones.)

13.0 Volume 2 - Past Performance 13.1General 13.2 Instructions The Offeror shall provide past performance information for evaluation. Failure to provide any information may result in the Offeror being removed from consideration for award. (NOTE: An Offeror with no past performance experience should submit the Past Performance Volume with explanation that it has no recent or relevant experience.) The Government will evaluate past performance through an integrated analysis of those risks and strengths the Government identifies in the Offeror's recent and relevant contract performance. For a description of the characteristics or aspects the Government will consider in determining relevance, see Addendum to 52.212-2. In evaluating the Offeror's past performance record, the Government will use present and past performance information gathered from various sources, which may include, but is not limited to, the past performance information documents submitted, Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPARs), questionnaires, and interviews. The Government will place more weight and consideration on more relevant and recent past performance information. For the purposes of this evaluation, the term "Offeror" includes the prime contractor and/or team members and major subcontractors performing over 20% of effort. 13.2.1 Contents of Past Performance Volume I The Offeror's Past Performance Volume shall contain the following: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Table of Contents Summary Page Past/Present Performance Information Sheets Past/Present Performance Questionnaire Tracking Record Past/Present Performance Assessment Report Consent Letters Organization Structure Change History

13.2.1.1 Table of Contents The Table of Contents shall list all documents contained in the Past Performance Volume. 13.2.1.2 Summary Page The Summary Page shall describe the role for the proposed global lightning data feeds of the Offeror and each subcontractor, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner that the Offeror is required to provide Past Performance Information Sheets on in accordance with paragraph 13.2.1.3 below. 13.2.1.3 Past/Present Performance Information Sheets 13.2.1.3.1 Submit information on contracts you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. For ID/IQ efforts with multiple points of performance or multiple points of contact, submit information on the specific Task/Delivery Order (e.g., if a contract is issued in one particular location, yet a task order is performed in a difference location, submit information specific to that task order and NOT to the main

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 16 of 42 contract). For those ID/IQ contracts with Delivery/Task Orders performed in multiple locations or with multiple points of contact, each Delivery/Task Order shall be counted as one contract. 13.2.1.3.2 Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance; however, the Government is not bound by the Offeror's opinion of relevance. Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the Offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts, as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Where problems existed, clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming these problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Furnish the following information for each contract referenced: 1. Company/Division name 2. Product/Service 3. Contracting Agency/Customer Contract Information 4. Contract Number 5. Contract Dollar Value 6. Period of Performance 7. Verified, up-to-date name, address, FAX and telephone number of contracting officer 8. Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions 9. Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. 13.2.1.3.3 This information is required on the prime Offeror, subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners proposed to perform at least 20% of the proposed effort based on the total proposed price, or performs aspects of the effort the Offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. The maximum number of Past/Present Performance Information sheets an Offeror may submit is three (3) for the prime and one (1) for the critical subcontractor. At a minimum, the Offeror shall submit at least two (2) Past/Present Performance Information sheets for the prime. Each past/present performance information sheet is limited to three pages. The Offeror's past/present performance information sheets must identify active or completed contracts, either Government (international, federal, state or local) or commercial, for the prime, subcontractors, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner, and must be for the same type effort of providing global lightning data feeds. The Past/Present Performance Information Sheet must reflect the same division or cost center as that proposed. In determining recency, the Government will only consider work performed under an effort existing on or after 1 August 2008. Additionally, the Government will not consider any new contracts awarded or where performance began on or after 1 April 2011, due to the limited performance history of these efforts.

13.2.1.4 Past/Present Performance Questionnaire Tracking Record The Offeror shall send out, and confirm receipt and submission of the Past/Present Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 5), to each of the Offeror's, critical subcontractors', teaming contractors' and/or joint venture partners' (i.e., each entity's) Points of Contact (POCs) identified in the Past/Present Performance Questionnaire Tracking Record (Attachment 6). The responsibility to send out and track the receipt and submission of the Past/Present Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the Offeror. For each questionnaire, complete and sign a letter containing substantially the same information as in the Sample Questionnaire Cover Letter (Attachment 4). Cover letters should be printed on company letterhead. The Offeror shall exert its best efforts to ensure that at least one current POC, per relevant contract, submit a completed Past/Present Performance Questionnaire directly to the Government not later than the due date for the past performance proposal volume. Each of the Offeror's POCs shall fax or e-mail his/her completed Past/Present Performance Questionnaire directly to Ms. Melissa Frans and Mr. Brian Stricker at fax number (402) 294-0430 or e-mail Melissa.Frans@offutt.af.mil and Brian.Stricker@offutt.af.mil. Please instruct points of contact to call Ms. Frans at 402-294-3862 or Mr. Stricker at 402-232-6578 before faxing their responses. Mailing the questionnaire(s) is an acceptable alternative method of transmission. The mailing address is:

55 CONS/LGCZ ATTN: Melissa Frans & Brian Stricker 101 WASHINGTON SQ BLDG 40 OFFUTT AFB NE 68113-2107 If mailing, the outside envelope must be marked as follows: NOTE: TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION - SEE FAR 3.104 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Once the Past/Present Performance Questionnaires are completed by the points of contact, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be released to the Offeror. Questionnaires shall be sent to, and best efforts made to ensure completion and submission directly to the Government from at least two of the following: Procuring Contracting Officer/Contract Negotiator or equivalent Program/Project Manager, or equivalent Administrative Contracting Officer/Contract Administrator or equivalent 13.2.1.5 Past/Present Performance Assessment Report This information is required on the contracts/task orders submitted in accordance with paragraph 13.2.1.3 Past/Present Performance Information Sheets. If an evaluation form other than a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) has been used in conducting performance assessments, such as an Award Fee notification letter, submit that form. If a CPAR or other evaluation form has been accomplished on the Offeror's existing work, but the contracting office for that requirement will not release the information, the Offeror shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer or Contract Administrator for this solicitation. Provide the contract number, point-of-contact and phone number from which the past/present performance information should be obtained. This information should be provided to the Contracting Officer or Contract Administrator for this solicitation as soon as any difficulty occurs and before the proposal due date. 13.2.1.6 Consent Letters Past/present performance information concerning subcontractors and teaming partners cannot be disclosed to a private party without the subcontractor's or teaming partner's consent. Because the Offeror is a private party, the Government will need that consent before disclosing subcontractor / teaming partner past/present performance information to the Offeror during exchanges. In an effort to assist the Government in assessing your past/present performance relevancy and confidence, request a Consent Letter (Attachment 6) be completed by the major subcontractors and teaming partners identified in the proposal. The completed consent letter should be submitted as part of the Past Performance Information Volume, but will not be considered in the page count of this Volume. Should the Offeror not submit a completed Consent Letter for major subcontractors or teaming partners, the Government will only discuss past/present performance information directly with the prospective subcontractor or teaming partner that is being reviewed. If there is a problem with the proposed subcontracto r's or teaming partner's past/present performance, the Offeror can be notified of a problem, but no details may be discussed without the subcontractor's / teaming partner's permission. 13.2.1.7 Organization Structure Change History Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past/present performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 18 of 42 the Offeror(s), the "roadmap" shall be both specifically applicable to the efforts identified and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources. This information is required on the Offeror, subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners. 13.2.2 Determination of Responsibility Even though the assessment of Past Performance as a specific evaluation factor is separate and distinct from the Determination of Responsibility required by FAR 9.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors, past performance information obtained herein will be used to support the Determination of Responsibility for the successful Offeror. 14.0 Volume 3 ­ Price 14.1 Price will be assessed for reasonableness and affordability pursuant to FAR 15.305(a), 15.402(a), 15.404-1. 14.2 Complete blocks 12, 17a, and 30a, b, and c of the SF 1449. In doing so, the Offeror accedes to the contract terms and conditions as written in the SOLICITATION, with attachments. 14.3 Insert proposed unit and extended prices in the Pricing Schedule per CLIN on pages 3-5 of this RFP. The proposal(s) must be submitted for a base year plus four (4) Option Years. 14.4 Complete and return with proposal necessary fill-ins and certifications to include FAR 52.212-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000, and 252.225-7000. 14.5 Exceptions To Terms And Conditions Exceptions taken to terms and conditions of the solicitation, to any of its formal attachments, or to other parts of the solicitation shall be identified. Each exception shall reference the paragraph and/or specific part of the solicitation to which it is taken, the page and paragraph number, and justification for why the requirement will not be met. Provide rationale in support of the exception and fully explain its impact, if any, on the performance, schedule, price, and specific requirements of the solicitation. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the proposal being considered non-responsive and result in the Offeror being removed from consideration for award.

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) (ii) (iii) Technical Capability/ Risk Past Performance Price

Technical is equal to past performance in importance and combined is significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 19 of 42 prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2: Basis for Contract Award This is a competitive Full Trade Off source selection in which the Government will select for award the offeror deemed to provide the best overall value to the Government, based upon an integrated assessment of Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. This best value source selection will be conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 215.3, the Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures, the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and the Air Force Mandatory Procedures (MP5315.3) for Source Selections. The contract may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, and all other information required by this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award a single contract to the offeror who gives the Government the best value and assurance that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. However, the Government reserves the right to not award a contract depending on the quality of proposals submitted and availability of funds. The Government may award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. To arrive at a source selection decision, the SSA will integrate the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) evaluation of the factors, subfactors (described below), past performance and proposed cost. While the SSEB and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: Technical Capability will be evaluated using a separate technical/risk rating. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and affordability. Past Performance is equal with technical and when combined significantly more important than price. A. Technical Capability: The Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical capability proposals submitted by using a separate technical/risk rating in accordance with methodology 2 in the DOD Source Selection Procedures 3.1.2.2. Each subfactor shall receive a technical and risk rating The technical rating evaluates the quality of the offeror's technical solution for meeting the Governments Requirement. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the Requirement. The evaluations shall use the following tables for ratings.

The proposals shall be evaluated against the following subfactors in decending order of importance: Subfactor 1: The contractor shall demonstrate its ability to provide cloud-to-ground (CG) and cloud-to-cloud (CF) global lightning data in accordance with the specifications in tables 2-4 of the PWS. The contractor shall also provide its statistical information on the Contractor's CG lightning data product by submitting Attachment 3, tables 1 -3. In accordance with 1.0 of FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors ­ Commercial items, the contractor shall not copy tables 2-4 from the PWS for this information and shall provide sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. Copying information from tables 2-4 from the PWS will cause the contractor to be considered nonresponsive technically unacceptable. (NOTE: A contractor may indicate, in the table they fill out, that actual statistics on their systems are not available where applicable for the appropriate zones.) Subfactor 2: The contractor shall demonstrate its approach to maintain network and data ability to 98% (IAW PWS 3.0.7.1) monthly or higher with no more than 12 hours of down time during any month in the event of network outage, data delivery problems, sensors down, etc and their plan to restore service during the down time in accordance with 3.0.7 of the PWS. Subfactor 3: The contractor shall demonstrate its ability to deliver the data in accordance with the delivery specifications in section 3 of the PWS. Subfactor 4: The contractor shall demonstrate its ability to provide Help Desk Support 24 hours a day, seven days a week in accordance with Section 3, paragraph 3.0.8 of the PWS.

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 21 of 42

Subfactor 5: The contractor transition plan, in accordance with 3.0.2.3 of the PWS, shall demonstrate its ability to integrate the contractor's data feed with Air Force Weather Agency's software to ensure a seamless transition to the winning bidder within the Period of Performance specified in the Transition Period CLIN 0002. Subfactor 6: The contractor shall provide global coverage charts for location accuracy and detection efficiency. IAW PWS Appendix A: Coverage Area Maps (NOTE: A contractor may indicate, on the coverage charts they provide, that actual statistics on their systems are not available and they are unable to provide the coverage maps; where applicable, for the appropriate zones.)

C. PAST PERFORMANCE Recency and Relevancy In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation. More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort. A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a "Neutral/Unknown Confidence" rating. Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance. Offerors are to note that, in conducting this assessment, the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by the Offeror and data obtained from other sources. Past performance information will be obtained through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), similar systems of other Government departments and agencies, questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of this acquisition, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) channels, interviews with program managers and contracting officers, and other sources known to the Government, including commercial sources. In order to be considered relevant, the effort must have been performed on or after 1 April 2008 with a performance start date before 1 April 2011, and must have been the same type effort. The Government may consider, for relevancy, efforts performed for agencies of the federal, state, or local Governments and commercial customers where the performance can be independently verified. Where relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The following relevancy definitions apply for past performance contracts submitted for Global Lightning Data services: PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY RATINGS RATING VERY RELEVANT RELEVANT SOMEWHAT RELEVANT NOT RELEVANT Criteria:  Provided global lightning STROKE data in ASCII or XML format Definition Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

This will allow Offerors to provide the most current past performance information for consideration. Additionally, the Government will not consider any new contracts awarded or where performance began on or after 1 April 2011, due to the limited performance history of these efforts. An offeror's past performance information will be evaluated and rated using the following qualitative performance ratings.

Performance was accomplished with some problems, and the contractor took effective corrective actions for those problems that did occur. During the contract period, contractor performance is not meeting (or did not meet) some contract requirements. There were instances where performance was at a less than acceptable level; performance was accomplished with some problems and some corrective actions appeared only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. Customer involvement was required. During the contract period, contractor performance is failing (or failed) to meet most contract requirements and performance is (or was) at an unacceptable level.

Performance Confidence Assessment Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an Offeror's past work records to assess the Government's confidence in the Offeror's probability of successfully performing the contract requirements. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user's needs, including performance and cost. The contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on each offer based on (1) the references and information provided by the Offeror, (2) Past Performance Questionnaires, and (3) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving gathering and distributing global lightning data. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in DoD Mandatory Procedures, Table 5. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal Offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. The performance ratings are:

PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS Rating SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE Description Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

D. Analysis of Price: Price will be assessed for reasonableness and affordability pursuant to FAR 15.305(a), 15.402(a), and 15.404-1. There is no rating (e.g. color, risk, etc.) associated with the price factor. The total

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 24 of 42 evaluated price for award purposes will be the sum of all priced Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS), including all option years (in accoradance with 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract) and six month extension (in accoradance with 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services). For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business. Price reasonableness will be determined based on a comparison of offeror's overall total evaluated price. Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and/or price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. For additional information see FAR 31.201-3. To assess affordability, the Government will review the contractor's proposed price against the Government's expected budget for each fiscal year. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION (MAY 2006)

(a) Contract line item(s) 0001 through 5001 are incrementally funded. For these item(s), the sum of $0.00 of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause. (b) For items(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s). (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up

FA4600-11-R-0053 Page 38 of 42 to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT". (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly. (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "disputes." (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause. (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "DEFAULT." The provisions of this clause are limited to work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract if fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause. (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT." (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342. (j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule: On execution of contract $-(month) (day), (year) $---(month) (day), (year) $---(month) (day), (year) $---(End of clause)
