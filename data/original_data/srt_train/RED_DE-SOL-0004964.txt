PROCEEDING CONTRACT FORMAT This solicitation is prepared using an outline that applies Attachments 1 - 3 into the resulting awarded contract. Attachment 4, Representations and Certifications will be incorporated into the contract by reference only. Attachment 5, Solicitation Provisions and Evaluation will not be retained upon contract award. B. EVALUATION 1. FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: The single evaluation factor for award is lowest-price, technically acceptable. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not

obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 2. BASIS FOR AWARD The resulting contract award will be issued based on the lowest price technically acceptable. An award will be made to the offer that presents the best value to the Government when considering the lowest evaluated price and the ability to meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-cost factors (technical requirements). The possible proposal ratings are Pass (meets or exceeds requirements on all non-cost evaluation criteria) or Fail (does not meet requirements on all non-cost evaluation criteria). The Contracting Officer will analyze the proposals against the requirements set forth in this solicitation to determine which technically acceptable proposal represents the lowest price to the Government. Trade-offs will not be used. Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability but they will not be ranked using the non-cost/price factors. 3. TECHNICAL EVALUATION In order to be considered technically acceptable, an Offeror's technical proposal must pass the technical criteria listed below, and failure to meet any one criterion shall deem the entire proposal as technically unacceptable. Corresponding proposal preparation instructions are in described Section A (5) (b) of Attachment 5. Each Offeror's proposal will be evaluated against whether the Offeror's technical proposal and description meets or exceeds all of the specific technical requirements outlined in item 2 of the Statement of Work (Attachment 1). DOE will evaluate the offeror's technical acceptability and capability to successfully perform the Statement of Work. 4. PRICE EVALUATION The Offeror's price proposal (completed Attachment 2) will not be point scored, but will be evaluated for reasonableness to determine the lowest price technically acceptable offer in accordance to Attachment 5, B (3) above. The Offeror's prices will be evaluated to assess reasonableness of the proposed prices. 5. FAR 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JULY 1990) Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
