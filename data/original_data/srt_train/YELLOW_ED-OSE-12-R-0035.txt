52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (February 2012), by reference Addendum to 52.212-1 ­ Proposal Instructions While the intent of each task is spelled out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), it is up to the offeror to propose the most effective method for carrying out these tasks. The task

PAGE 19 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

specifications contained in the PWS are a starting point; the proposal is expected to build on them, not simply repeat the language contained in the PWS. It is important that the offeror completely address all the tasks described in PWS. Where specific due dates for deliverables are listed in the schedule of deliverables, the offeror is expected to include these dates in the technical proposal. Any proposed changes to the scope of the work or to the deliverable dates shall be justified. Assured results in terms of obtaining and analyzing high quality data, analytical procedures, reporting results, and cost-effectiveness are all of the utmost importance. The technical proposal should be written in enough detail to allow a review panel to adequately judge its full merits. The panel will not make assumptions or guesses. Offerors shall use the proposal format described below: A. Organization of Proposal Each offer shall consist of two separately packaged proposals: (1) a technical proposal, and (2) a business proposal. All information necessary to judge the technical soundness and management capabilities of the offeror will be contained in the technical proposal. The business proposal will contain all information related to the determination of the costs associated with each of the project's tasks. The technical proposal will not contain any reference to specific costs, but resource information (e.g. staff hours) may be included so that the offeror's understanding of the scope of the work may be evaluated. Authors of each section will be clearly identified in the proposal's Table of Contents. B. Format/ Content of the Technical Proposal The technical proposal should be limited to a maximum of 40 double-spaced pages using font size no smaller than 12 points. The page limit includes the narrative, and corresponding tables and graphics. Specifications pertaining to font and spacing do not apply to tables, figures, or exhibits. Any pages over 40 shall not be considered. The page limit excludes resumes and letters agreements from subcontractor or partners if any. Offerors shall follow the format and content requirements detailed below in preparing their technical proposals. The technical proposal shall contain: 1. Table of Contents. The proposal should include a Table of Contents as a means of quickly accessing important points of discussion in the proposal. 2. Introduction. The Introduction should briefly describe the offeror's overall plan for achieving the objectives of this contract, the scope of work, intended products, and the applicability of these products to the objectives. Additionally, the introduction shall include a short summary of the offeror's qualifications and unique strengths relevant to this activity. 3. Technical Approach. The offeror should fully demonstrate their ability to effectively and efficiently develop a consolidated web-based data collection system with portals for multiple

PAGE 20 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

users and a web site that is user friendly and contains information relevant to grantees, scholars, employers, and the Department. The offeror should fully demonstrate their ability to successfully develop methods, collect data, and analyze, synthesize, and report data used with OMB and GPRA performance measures. The offeror should demonstrate a practical and comprehensive technical approach to fulfill the requirements of the PWS. Offerors shall indicate the name of key personnel assigned to each task. In addition to comprehensive responses to the tasks described in the PWS, offerors shall provide in their technical proposal initial approaches to the following questions:  

What is the most effective way to consolidate and modify the web-based data collection systems and Web sites to meet the technical and security requirements of the PWS? What methods (i.e., design, data collection, and analyses) can be employed to improve the usefulness of the GPRA Performance Measures (see FY 2010 IDEA Part D Special Education Personnel Preparation (Development) Program performance reports and "Explanation" sections for approaches to GPRA measures which can be found at: http://www.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/2010report/program.html) What strategies can the contractor use to ensure that service obligation regulations and requirements are effectively communicated to IHEs, scholars/obligees, and employers?



4. Proposed Key Personnel. The proposed key personnel section should indicate clearly the relationship between staff expertise and experience and proposed task assignment on this contract. Key personnel should demonstrate expertise and experience in developing and maintaining effective web-based data collection systems and GPRA/PART or similar program evaluation research. Resumes should be included for all key personnel for this contract, including key personnel from subcontractors. Resumes should document only directly related experience, educational background, publications, and professional activities. All resumes should share a common format and organization. A letter of commitment from all proposed key personnel not currently employed by the offeror should be included. The need for any proposed consultants shall also be fully justified, including how they would contribute to the project. Consultant resumes shall be provided. If key personnel are unknown at the time of submission, a position description (including job duties, qualifications required, and selection criteria) should be substituted for resumes. Upon review of the resumes, the U.S. Department of Education shall have approval rights of the individuals selected by the contractor to staff the team, including project director. By listing key personnel as part of the proposal this represents a firm commitment by the offeror to use said personnel to carry out the activities in the performance work statement. 5. Management Plan. The offeror should provide a summary description of the management control system that is used internally for planning, scheduling, budgeting, managing, and reporting the accomplishments of this requirement. The offeror must describe how the internal

PAGE 21 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

Other End Products: Line Item No. Country of Origin ______________ _________________ ______________ _________________ ______________ _________________ [List as necessary] (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in

PAGE 34 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that-- (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

(End of provision) 3452.209-70--Conflict of Interest Certification (May 2011) (a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to nonpublic information through its performance on a government contract.

PAGE 38 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

(ii) Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. ``Impaired objectivity'' includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term ``potential conflict'' means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if ``impaired objectivity'', or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the

PAGE 39 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (f) Conflict of Interest Certification. The offeror, [insert name of offeror], hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Quote No. [insert number] that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term ``potential conflict'' means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest). Offeror's Name______________________ RFP/Contract No.____________________ Signature___________________________ Title_______________________________ Date_______________________________ (End of Provision) 3452.239­71 Notice to offerors of Department security requirements (MAR 2011) (a) The offeror and any of its future subcontractors will have to comply with Department security policy requirements as set forth in the ``Bidder's Security Package: Security Requirements for Contractors Doing Business with the Department of Education'' at: http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/about/bsp.html. (b) All contractor employees must undergo personnel security screening if they will be employed for 30 days or more, in accordance with Departmental Directive OM:5­101, ``Contractor Employee Personnel Security Screenings,'' available at: http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/about/acs/acsom5101.doc. (c) The offeror shall indicate the following employee positions it anticipates to employ in performance of this contract and their proposed risk levels based on the guidance provided in Appendix I of Departmental Directive OM:5­101: High Risk (HR): [Specify HR positions.]. Moderate Risk (MR): [Specify MR positions.]. Low Risk (LR): [Specify LR positions.]. (d) In the event the Department disagrees with a proposed risk level assignment, the issue

PAGE 40 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

shall be subject to negotiation. However, if no agreement is reached, the Department's risk level assignment shall be used. The type of screening and the timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data to be accessed, and the type of information technology (IT) system access required. Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause.

ATTACHMENT A: PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (version May 3, 2012)

U. S. Department of Education Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) OSEP Personnel Development Program (PDP) Data Collection System: Scholar Data Report (SDR) and Service Obligations Tracking System (SOTS) Purpose The Department requires a single system to more efficiently and effectively collect, analyze, and report data currently collected separately by the SDR and SOTS. The SDR data is required for reporting the Personnel Development Program (PDP) performance required by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), and the SOTS is necessary to track scholar/obligee service obligations as required by Part D of the "Individuals with Disabilities Education Act" (IDEA). Therefore, it is necessary to consolidate the two current Web sites and web-based data collection systems. In addition, the system must be modified to include data from the additional service obligations resulting from the Personnel Development to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities--Leadership Preparation in Sensory Disabilities (Consortium) grants. Data includes, but is not limited to prior employment and training, current training and employment, end of year training status, employment at the time of exit, and service obligation status for all scholars who were enrolled in OSEP-funded PDP grants during each budget year of a grant beginning in fiscal year 2005 and continuing for three years after program completion or until the scholars/obligees' service obligations are fulfilled (whichever is greater), or the scholar/obligee enters repayment status. Furthermore, customer service, including, but not limited to information about the Web site, web-based data collection system, programmatic information, requirements and regulations to institutions of higher education (IHEs), scholars/obligees, employers who use the system as well as to the Department's Accounts Receivable Group (ARG), will be an important component of this contract. Background The PDP is aimed at increasing the supply of effective personnel in the field of special education. This program awards competitive grants to IHEs to support scholars receiving training to provide special education and related services to children and youth with disabilities. GPRA and IDEA and the related promulgated regulations, i.e., the "Additional Requirements" section of the Personnel Preparation To Improve Services and Results for Children With Disabilities--Combined and Leadership Priorities for Personnel Preparation notice published in the Federal Register on March 25, 2005 (2005 SO Regulations) and the Federal Register 34 CFR Part 304 Vol. 71 No. 107 June 5, 2006, the Service Obligations Under Special Education­ Personnel Development to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities (2006 SO Regulations), place requirements on the PDP that require data collection for two main purposes. First, GPRA requires OSEP to report performance measure data on PDP grants awarded to IHEs. Second, the Department is required to track the service obligations of scholars/obligees who receive funding from a PDP grant to ensure that they work in the field of special education or related services for a specified period of time or repay part or all of the funding received.

PAGE 43 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

The three data sets that will be consolidated under this acquisition are: (1) The SDR which collects most of the PDP performance measure data; (2) the SOTS which tracks the eligible employment of scholars who have received funding from most of the PDP training grants awarded by OSEP; and (3) the Consortium data from grants awarded by OSEP to prepare educators with expertise in the education of students with sensory impairments. For further information about these entities, visit: https://oseppdpprs.ed.gov for SDR, http://www.serviceobligation.org for NCSO, and http://www.salus.edu/nclvi/fellows.htm and http://www.salus.edu/nlcsd/ for the Consortium. The following sections on performance measures, service obligations and the Consortium describe these functions in greater detail. Performance Measures This contract will collect, analyze and report data for each of five years as follows. The collection, analysis and reporting of data for the first performance measure below is and will continue to be supported under a separate contract dedicated to IDEA Part D GPRA Performance Measurement. Information on the Personnel Development Performance Measures and a description of the source of data for the measures can be found at: http://www.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/2010report/program.html. The Personnel Development Program performance measures are as follows: (1) The percentage of Special Education Personnel Development projects that incorporate evidence-based practices into their curricula; (2) The percentage of scholars completing funded Special Education Personnel Development programs who are knowledgeable and skilled in evidence-based practices for infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities; (3) The percentage of Special Education Personnel Development funded scholars who exit preparation programs prior to completion due to poor academic performance; (4) The percentage of Special Education Personnel Development funded degree/certification program recipients who are working in the area(s) in which they were prepared upon program completion; (5) The percentage of Special Education Personnel Development funded degree/certification recipients who are working in the area(s) for which they were prepared upon program completion and who are fully qualified under IDEA; (6) The percentage of Special Education Personnel Development degree/certification recipients who maintain employment in the area(s) for which they were prepared for three or more years and who are fully qualified under IDEA; and (7) The Federal cost per fully qualified Special Education Personnel Development funded degree or certification recipient.

PAGE 44 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

The description and methodology for all seven program performance measures are submitted to Congress in ED's Fiscal Year 2012 budget justification. The most recent report for this program is located at http: http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget12/justifications/ispecialed.pdf Under this contract, the following three OMB-requested measures will be added to the existing data collection: (1) The number and percentage of degree/certification recipients who are employed in highneed schools (2) The number and percentage of degree/certification recipients who are employed in a school for at least three years. (3) The number and percentage of degree/certification recipients who receive a positive evaluation from their employer. Service Obligations This contract will collect data from IHEs, scholars/obligees and employers to track the eligible employment of scholars/obligees, who have been awarded scholarships from Personnel Development Program grants, until their service obligations are fulfilled or they are referred to the ARG for repayment of part or all of the funding received. In order to facilitate this process, the current secure, online database used to collect scholar contact and service obligation information must be improved and maintained to ensure fulfillment of the service obligation as defined in the regulations. As of February 2012, 10,324 scholar/obligee records had been submitted and 505 were pending. Consortium This contract will collect data from IHEs, scholars/obligees, and employers to track the eligible employment of Consortium scholars/obligees. The Consortium is comprised of two grants with a current total of 47 scholars/obligees. The requirements for these scholars/obligees are different than the requirements for the scholars/obligees tracked by the SOTS. For further information, visit the Web sites provided in the Background section above. Additional information will be provided after the award is made. Authorizing Legislation and Regulations for Performance Measures and Service Obligtions The legislative authority for a performance measure acquisition is found in PL 108-446 Part D Section 682 (c) PROGRAM EVALUATION. ­ The Secretary may use funds made available to carry out subpart 2 or 3 to evaluate activities carried out under subpart 2 or 3, respectively. The authorization for a service obligations acquisition is found in Public Law 108-446, Section 662 (20 U.S.C. 1400) that addresses providing personnel development to improve services and

results for children with disabilities (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ446.108). The Service Obligation language in IDEA, Part D, Section 662(h), states that: (1) Each application for assistance... shall include an assurance that the eligible entity will ensure that scholars who receive a scholarship under the proposed project agree to subsequently provide special education and related services to children with disabilities, or in the case of leadership personnel to subsequently work in the appropriate field, for a period of 2 years for every year for which the scholarship was received or repay all or part of the amount of the scholarship, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. (3) Secretary's responsibility.--The Secretary--``(A) shall ensure that individuals described in paragraph (1) comply with the requirements of that paragraph; The Service Obligation regulations delineate the requirements.

In addition, OSEP will facilitate the transfer of the existing data from the Consortium IHEs to incorporate into the consolidated and modified Web site and web-based data collection system. The contractor shall provide a solution for collecting the Consortium legacy service obligation information and performance measure data, determine how to calculate the Consortium service obligations, and develop a method to collect data from Consortium IHEs, scholars and employers. Deliverables: 3.1 The contractor shall receive the existing Web sites, web-based data collection systems, and all related data from the existing contractors within 10 day after the award of the contract. 3.2 The contractor shall provide to the COR a written confirmation specifying what was received from the Contractors and the date of the receipt. 3.3 The contractor shall have entered all Consortium legacy data 32 weeks after the award of the contract. Task 4 Consolidate Two Web sites and Two Web-based Data Collection Systems and Modify the System for the Consortium Service Obligation Data Because the Contractor may not have the same platform or the same program associated with the current web-based data collection systems, the Contractor shall design a system and make all modifications necessary to ensure that all aspects of the Web site and web-based data collection system are fully operable, including data collection for the Consortium. The system shall provide for both public and secure links. The secure link must be accessible only by the IHEs, scholars/obligees and employers that will be entering data and for whom logins and passwords will be provided by the Contractor. Public links shall include, at a minimum, access to: a description of the purpose of the data collection, the data collection instruments, data submission instructions, frequently asked questions, performance measure results, and training modules. Descriptions of the SDR and SOTS web-based data collection systems follow: SDR web-based data collection system. The SDR, an existing data collection instrument, and the web-based data collection system are designed to collect information annually from all OSEP PDP grants on each scholar who received scholarship support or was enrolled in the grant support program during the grant budget period. Each grantee submits data on the characteristics, prior employment and training, current training and employment, end of year training status, and employment at the time of exit for each scholar who was enrolled in the OSEP-funded program during each grant budget year. Grants are funded for four years (five year awards began in FY 2011), and grantees submit SDR data for each fiscal year that they are active (that is, for each year that they receive federal funds

PAGE 48 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

or are in a no-cost extension period). It is estimated that approximately 450 grants are active in a fiscal year (including those in a no-cost extension period) and that approximately 7500 scholars are enrolled each year in these grant-supported programs. The majority of scholars receive grant support for more than one year. Grantees submit and then update data on these scholars for each year that they are enrolled in the OSEP-funded program. The SDR has undergone several revisions. The current SDR has OMB approval (OMB 1820-0530) with an expiration date of January 31, 2014. The web-based data collection system resides on a server at the site of the current Contractor. The centralized online data entry application was built using HTML and ASP.NET 4.0 with the data stored in a centralized MS SQL 2000 Server database. The application consists of approximately 100 HTML and ASP pages. It includes an on-line version of the survey instrument with text boxes, drop-down lists, check boxes, and radio buttons that replicates the OMB-approved SDR. Java Script is used to perform edit checks and skip patterns to maximize the reliability of the data. In addition, the application includes secure access, online data status reports, and email receipts to grantees. An Access application produces data entry status reports for system administrators and provides a means to manage grantee passwords. The current Contractor manages all data in an MS SQL Server database management system (DBMS) and manages the production Web site running Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) version 6.0. OSEP will facilitate the transfer of the current the SDR and the web-based data collection system to the Contractor for performance under this contract within ten days after contract award. These annual data have been collected, analyzed and reported to OSEP since FY 2001. The results of some of the analyses conducted on data sets (FY 2001 through FY 2009) can be viewed on the Web site identified above. Description of the SOTS web-based data collection system. The SOTS, an existing web-based data collection system is designed to collect information on a continuous basis from all OSEP PDP grantees, scholars/obligees, and employers. The system is approved at the moderate security level and maintains social security numbers which is necessary for tracking scholar/obligee service obligations. The SOTS is a secure, online database used to track the fulfillment of service obligations. The SOTS has four types of user access levels: Contractor administrators, IHEs, scholars/obligees and employers. IHEs are responsible for entering the contact, training and service obligation details of funded scholars/obligees. Scholars/obligees upload their updated contact and employment information in the SOTS and employers access the SOTS to verify the employment of scholars/obligees. IHEs can view the service obligation status for the scholars/obligees they have entered. Scholars/obliges have access to detailed dashboard of their service obligation owed and total obligation fulfilled to date based on the employment information entered. Employers are provided a simple online report where they can verify the employment information provided by the scholar/obligee. The SOTS has both a web server and a database server which are housed at a third party server hosting data center. SOTS uses Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition, Symantec

PAGE 49 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

Endpoint Protection Antivirus for Windows, Cold Fusion 8 Application Server web server software. The data base server software consists of Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition ­ 32 bit, Symantec Endpoint Protection Antivirus for Windows, MS SQL Server 2005, Standard Edition with SP 2, Network Event Viewer, and Backup storage software. NCSO also uses Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition ­ 32 bit, Symantec Endpoint Protection Antivirus for Windows, MS SQL Server 2005, Standard Edition, with SP 2, Network Event Viewer, Backup storage software for database server software.

OPTIONAL TASK 19 ­ Indian Education Professional Development (IEPD) System This optional task will be exercised based the cost of the required system modification required to include the Professional Development program in the Service Obligation Tracking System (SOTS) and the availability of program funds. Purpose The intent of this task is to extend the SOTS to the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education's Office of Indian Education (OIE) for use with its Indian Education Professional Development (IEPD) Discretionary Grant Program. Similar to the Office of Special Education Programs' (OSEP) Personnel Development Program to Improve Services and Results for Children with Disabilities (Personnel Development Program), OIE's IEPD program requires the participant to repay the funds through either service or fiscal payback. Individuals who receive training must perform work related to the training received under the program and that benefits Indian people (service payback) or they must repay all or a prorated part of the assistance received under the program (cash payback). Participant payback

PAGE 64 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

obligations remain active until completely repaid, either through service, fiscal, or a combination of the two. Participants are required to report semiannually to OIE on their compliance with the work requirement. There is no time limit for the completion of service or fiscal payback. OIE monitors employment verification and when a lapse of 6 months or greater occurs, the participant is referred to ARG for cash payback. ARG determines the payback period for cash debts based on a participant's financial situation and notifies OIE when cash payback is completed. Although program regulations for OSEP and IEPD are very similar, the SOTS will need some modifications to fulfill the data collection needs of the IEPD program. The differences we have identified so far are: 1) participants in the PD program can receive funding from multiple grants, 2) there are no restrictions on the number of times a participant can switch between service and cash payback, 3) OIE staff tracks service payback, not the grantee, 4) participants receive a 6month grace period to obtain work before service payback begins, 5) participants and grantees update information every 6 months, 6) there is no minimum amount of training required to be eligible for service payback, and 7) grantees will be required to report the total training cost for each participant by the following categories: tuition, books, and fees; stipend; child care; and miscellaneous expenses (with explanation). OIE is transforming to a more data-based decision-making program. To this end, OIE is changing the data required by grantees, participants, and employers as part of this task to provide the necessary data that will enable these types of decisions. Including IEPD in the SOTS will streamline the collection of data from grantees, participants, and employers. There are approximately 2,870 active participants in the Professional Development program with about 550 of them to be tracked as a result of this Optional Task. IEPD expects to add approximately 250 new participants and 9 grantees a year going forward. Background The current IEPD data collection is paper-based. A move to an electronic system would assist the OIE in adequately accounting for the number of students actually being served by the program; adequately account for training funds provided to students under the program; determine whether students are fulfilling work payback requirements in support of program goals; ensure students who cannot fulfill work payback requirements are returning Federal funds received; and identify potential anomalies in student participation. The move from a paper-based system to a webbased electronic system is expected to reduce the burden on grantees and participants and be more cost efficient for the federal government. Program Specific Performance Measures This optional task will collect, analyze, and report data for each of the five years as follows. The Secretary has established the following key performance measures to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the Indian Education Professional Development program:

PAGE 65 OF 78 ED-OSE-12-R-0035

(1) The percentage of participants in administrator preparation projects who become principals, vice principals, or other school administrators in LEAs that enroll five percent or more American Indian and Alaska Native students; (2) The percentage of participants in teacher preparation projects who become teachers in LEAs that enroll five percent or more American Indian and Alaska Native students; (3) The percentage of program participants who meet the definition of "Highly Qualified'' in section 9101(23) of the ESEA; (4) The percentage of program participants who complete their service requirement on schedule; (5) The cost per individual who successfully completes an administrator preparation program, takes a position in a school district with at least five percent American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment, and completes the service requirement in such a district; and (6) The cost per individual who successfully completes a teacher preparation program, takes a position in such a school district with at least five percent American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment, and completes the service requirement in such a district. Currently, all grantees submit, as part of their annual performance report, information with respect to these performance measures. Service Obligations This optional task will collect data from grantees, participants, and employers to track the eligible employment of participants, who have received professional development funds, until their service obligations are fulfilled or they are referred to the ARG for repayment of part or all of the funding received. As of February 29, 2012, there were 2,807 participants who had received professional development funds from 127 grants awarded to institutions of higher education. Approximately 550 participants from 59 grantees will be tracked using this system and the remainder may be added at a later time if funding permits. On average, the PD program gains 250 participants and 9 grantees a year. Authorizing Legislation & Regulations: The authorization for this optional task is found in Public Law 107-110, Title VII, Part A, Subpart 2, Sec. 7122 (20 U.S.C 7442) (http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg100.html#sec7122. The regulations for this program are in 34 CFR 263 (http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/textidx?c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr263_main_02.tpl).

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
Introduction This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) sets forth procedures and guidelines that the Department of Education will use to monitor performance of the Contractor under this contract. A copy of this plan will be furnished to the contractor so that the contractor shall be aware of the methods that the Government will employ in monitoring performance on this project and address any concerns that the contractor may have prior to initiating work. Purpose of the QASP The QASP is intended to accomplish the following:   Define the roles and responsibilities of participating Government officials and outside experts; and Describe the process of quality assurance surveillance.

Each of these purposes is discussed in detail below. Roles and Responsibilities of Participating Government Officials The following Government Officials will participate in assessing the quality of the contractor's performance. Their roles and responsibilities are described as follows: Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR will be responsible for monitoring, assessing, recording, and reporting on the technical performance of the contractor on a day-to-day basis. The COR will also be responsible for inspecting all deliverables submitted under this contract and providing a recommendation regarding the acceptability of the deliverable to the Contracting Officer. It is essential that the COR establish and maintain a team-oriented line of communication with the Contractor's Project Director (PD) in order to perform monitoring functions. The COR, CO, and PD must work together as a team to ensure that required work is accomplished in an efficient and proper manner.

Meetings should be held on a regular basis in order to resolve serious problems. Less serious problems should be discussed and resolved on an impromptu basis. The Contracting Officer (CO) will have overall responsibility for overseeing the contractor's performance. The Contract Specialist will be responsible for the dayto-day monitoring of the contractor's performance in the areas of compliance, administration, cost control and property control; reviewing the COR's assessment of the contractor's performance; and resolving all differences between the COR's version and the contractor's version. The CO may call upon the expertise of other Government individuals as required. Quality Assurance Surveillance Process Even though the Government, through the COR, will be monitoring the contractor's performance on a continuing basis, the volume of tasks performed by the contractor makes technical inspections of every task and step impractical. Accordingly, the Department of Education will use a quality-assurance review process to monitor the contractor's performance under this contract through the contract deliverables, specifically through a review of the timeliness of submission and the acceptability of the content of each deliverable. The COR will inspect each deliverable and recommend acceptance of the deliverable to the Contracting Officer. In the event the COR has a concern regarding the timeliness or quality of the content of a deliverable, the contractor shall be notified as well as the Contracting Officer shall be notified. The Contractor's performance shall be documented and measured through the annual past performance evaluation through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Performance will be evaluated in the areas of:       Quality of Product or Service Schedule Cost Control (if applicable) Business Relations Management of Key Personnel Utilization of Small Business
