STATEMENT OF WORK

BACKGROUND
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administers the National Warning System (NAWAS), a 24-hour telephone system used to convey warnings to Federal, State and local governments, as well as the military and civilian population. NAWAS emphasis is on natural and technological disasters. In today's environment, the threats imposed by disasters make it imperative for all government officials to have access to an effective and reliable means of warning the public of impending emergencies so that they may take protective actions. NAWAS is used to disseminate warning information concerning natural and technological disasters to various warning points throughout the United States and the Virgin Islands. NAWAS allows issuance of warnings to all stations nationwide or to selected stations as dictated by the situation. FEMA operates and administers two separate NAWAS conference bridges to facilitate the rapid notification of emergency management officials in case of impending disasters and to support FEMA's all-hazard emergency management mission. FEMA issues warnings primarily to ten (10) FEMA Regions connected to the conference bridge by dedicated hoot n' holler circuits. The Regions can then disseminate the warning information to state systems for further dissemination to local communication systems.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS
Title VI of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes FEMA to use the NAWAS to support the All-Hazards emergency response mission of FEMA.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of this requirement is to provide a fully functional NAWAS Conference Bridge solution to replace the current NAWAS conference bridges at two FEMA site located in Virginia & Georgia. This requirement also includes training, maintenance and warranty of the goods and services obtained. The objectives of this project are to replace the current NAWAS conference bridges that have reached "end-of-life" with a new solution that functions in a manner similar to the existing bridges. Although a consolidated solution that provides traditional voice conferencing, Hoot N' Holler party line conferencing, and utilizes a single system administrative tool is preferred; Contractors may propose alternative "hybrid" solutions. Description of Current Conference Bridge The current conference bridge provides the bridging and alerting of the NAWAS circuits, the activation of the EAS system, and basic meet-me teleconference capabilities. Two (2) Comlabs Micro Controller Unit (MCU) Terminals with keypads are connected to the conference bridge via 4-wire line cards in a local PBX. The system "passes" DTMF signaling generated by the MCU terminal operator to remote terminals to provide the NAWAS alerting function. The system also includes two (2) Operator Positions; one for NAWAS operations and one for Emergency Alerting System (EAS) operations. The bridge is based on a Spectel 7000 integrated conference platform that includes a main chassis and system server. The bridge chassis directly interfaces twelve (12) 4-wire dedicated circuits, six (6) DS-1circuits, and a system server. The 4-wire interfaces do not utilize signaling and are dedicated "party lines" that connect directly to the ten (10) FEMA Regions, location 2200, and an EAS encoder-decoder (ENDEC). Four (4) DS-1 circuits connect to a local PBX and two (2) are connected to a remote PBX. Attachment B provides a "functional block diagram" of the current NAWAS Bridge configuration. Requirement This requirement provides for a turn-key implementation of two (2) conference bridges that can function as either separate bridges or as a single bridge that enables FEMA to effectively and efficiently operate and administer primary and secondary conference bridges. The solution must be able to bridge dedicated Hoot n' Holler circuits, Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTN), and B-2

IP networks in a single conference. Additionally, the solution must be capable of intuitive system operation and administration in a manner similar to the existing conference bridges. Examples of the current NAWAS conference bridge operator console graphical user interface (GUI) features and functionality are provided in Attachment A.

System Requirements The Vendor shall deliver, set up, optimize, and test NAWAS conference bridge systems at FEMA sites that are fully integrated with the existing 4-wire and PBX interface circuits at those sites. The systems when integrated shall preserve current conference bridge features and functionality (see Attachment A) and shall meet the following specific requirements: Features and Functionality Requirements The conference bridge systems shall support the following system features and functionality: ˇ ˇ Windows based web menu/icon driven graphical user interface System Menus (minimum) o Conferences o Monitor o Users o Groups o Reports o Help o Exit ˇ Conference participant specific functionality and associated specific icons o Participant can talk/Participant can not talk (mute/unmute talk) o Participant can listen/Participant not able to listen (mute/unmute listen) o Move Participant to sidebar o Standard Gain Control o Automatic Gain Control o Manual Gain Control o Volume Slider ˇ User Management functionality o Create Users

(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) The schedule of supplies/services.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the CCR database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Section C

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

C.17 HSAR 3052.209-72 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (JUN 2006)
(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting is based on the fact that the contractor may be put in a position to favor its own products, capabilities and services due to access to pre-acquisition planning and budgeting information about upcoming procurements. (b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award. (c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: [](1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or [](2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision. (d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.

C-17

HSFE50-12-R-0044 Section C (e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. (f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision. (g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.

C.18 3052-209-73 LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (JUN 2006)
(a) The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. Accordingly, the attention of prospective offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5--Organizational Conflicts of Interest. (b) The nature of this conflict is as follows: (1) The contractor may be in situations where performance under this task order may put the contractor in a position to favor its own products or capabilities; access to pre-acquisition planning information, for services in which the contractor would be interest in submitting a bid/quote; sharing source selection information with other vendors/clients as well as access to other contractors' (or potential competitors') proprietary information. (2) The Organizational Conflict of Interest that could arise from allowing the selected contractor to participate is so great that the associated risk could not be diminished with any mitigation plan proposed. Prospective vendors are advised to review this regulation prior to preparing their submission. It is determined, that in the aforementioned cases, the selected vendor shall be excluded from participating in future FEMA procurements in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 9.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). (c) The restrictions upon future contracting are as follows: (1) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of tasks pursuant to this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work that are to be incorporated into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime or first-tier subcontractor under an ensuing DHS contract. This restriction shall remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the duration of the initial production contract). DHS shall not unilaterally require the Contractor to prepare such specifications or statements of work under this contract. (2) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other companies, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use them to compete with those other companies.

Section E

E.4 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: FACTOR 1: Technical Understanding and Ability to Meet Requirements FACTOR 2: Past Performance FACTOR 3: Qualifications and Commitment of Personnel

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price for the purpose of proposal evaluation. As technical proposals become more equal in overall technical ability, price becomes more of a factor. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

HSFE50-12-R-0044 Section E (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

E.6 NOTICE OF FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY PROTESTS
A. Preface Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties must use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party. FEMA offers, as an option for dispute resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). ADR in an informal, expeditious and inexpensive way to resolve contract issues and is designed to promote satisfying solutions and fair procedures. For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address: Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA ADR Office Office of Alternative Dispute Resolution 400 Virginia Ave. Washington, DC 20472 E-19

HSFE50-12-R-0044 Section E If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency. These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest. Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103. B. Definitions. (1) "Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer. (2) "Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest. Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman. (3) "Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open. C. Submission Guidelines. (1) Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows: a. Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed or faxed to: FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY MT.

If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested). (2) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. (3) Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided: a. the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number; b. the solicitation or contract number; c. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced; d. copies of relevant documents; e. a request for ruling by the agency; f. a statement detailing the form of relief requested; g. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and h. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest. (4) All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman. D. Timeliness/Resolution of Protests. (1) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation. (2) Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held. (3) Protests filed through the Contracting Officer. a. Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)". b. Appeals i. Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman.

HSFE50-12-R-0044 Section E ii. Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested). iii. The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision. iv. In accordance with FAR 33.103(d)(4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a)(3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. (4) Protests filed through the Ombudsman: a. If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed. b. Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency. E. Dismissal of Protests. The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails to clearly state legally sufficient grounds of protest).
