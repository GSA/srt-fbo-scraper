Page 53 of 71 70

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

There are 14 (see delivery schedule), [(8) 1B5, (2) 1D5, (1) 2B5, (2) 4B5, and (1) 5B5,] that will be located in the Human Resources Office (HRO) Ft. Dix N.J. and these machines will need the following special requirements: Need Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management Systems (iPERMS). 13.1.1. Must transfer the scanned images to the network over an Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypted communication protocol. File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Server Message Block (SMB), are not SSL encrypted and are not authorized transmission protocols. 13.1.2. Based on Common Access Card (CAC) authentication, the proposed solution must be able to customize scan options based on user profiles or user group profile as a measure of operational security. Specifically, only authorized iPERMS users should have access it iPERMS scanning options at the devices. 13.1.3. Must provide direct integration with the iPERMS system to support Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP). The integration must enable an authorized CAC iPERMS user to scan Human Resources (HR) records and other soldier documents directly into an iPERMS batch (e.g. validation or verification). Metadata and indexing mapping (e.g. Soldier SSN, Document Type, Effective Date, UIC) must be supported. 13.1.4. The iPERMS capability must not relay on any email transfer of scanned documents. 13.1.5. Must also support barcode recognition as a method to index documents directly into the iPERMS system. This means that when scanning a batch of documents, if there is a barcode scanned first, that will identify the contents within the batch and be recognized by the iPERMS system. Indexing information about a document, so it can be identified. This helps to replace entering the information at the key pad, and the barcodes replaces this. The barcode has the information imbedded by typing in the relevant data at the user's computer, a bar code is printed that captures the relevant information and then is placed on top of the stack to be scanned. iPERMS requires certain information on the person uploading the files to properly index. 13.1.6. Upon delivery of the file to the folder, the proposed solution must have the ability to provide an email notification to the user that the scan has been successful. 13.1.7. Must provide full audit trail data on all documents scanned from the Device, including username, date/time stamp, page count, workflow metadata, and IP address of device. The proposed solution must also provide a dashboard interface (this is a way of tracking users, what services they are using by using pie charts and bar graphs to quickly determine what services and how frequently or with what volume that are being

ATTACHMENT #1

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD One award will be made to the responsible quoter who meets all the technical factors, has acceptable past performance and results in the lowest price to the government. A. Technical Factors To be technically acceptable each quote must demonstrate it meets all the Technical Factors (including all subfactors) set forth in the attached Performance Based Statement of Work and Specifications.
