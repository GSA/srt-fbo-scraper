STATEMENT OF WORK

													

Interagency Wilderness Character Monitoring Online Database





Estimated Performance Period: 	August 14th, 2013 – January 31, 2014



Contract Amount







1.0   BACKGROUND: 



     The Rocky Mountain Research Station houses the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, an interagency, interdisciplinary science center focused on social and ecological research to support management decisions for the National Wilderness Preservation System. 



The purpose of this contract is to develop an online wilderness character monitoring database that will be used by the four wilderness managing agencies (Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and USDA Forest Service) to enter data and produce reports on trends in wilderness character.  This online database will mimic the functionality and work flow, and the general look and feel, of an existing desktop Access database that can be downloaded by searching for “wilderness character monitoring database” at [http://irma.nps.gov].  A User Guide for this database that explains database functionality and includes screen captures is available for downloading at this same website.







1.1   Location of Work:



USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, 790 E. Beckwith Ave., ,   



1.2    Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR):  Danette L Paige, USDA FS RMRS, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, 790 E. Beckwith Ave. ,  



1.3   Task Manager: Peter Landres, USDA FS RMRS, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, 790 E. Beckwith Ave Missoula, MT 59801



2.0   TASK:



2.1   Goals of Contract

Convert the current MS Access desktop database application to an online SQL Server application, retaining all the functionality, quality assurance and control checking routines and associated error messages, and the general look and feel that is in the current desktop version.

Add new functionality as described in the section New Online Database Functionality below.



	

2.2   Expertise Needed

Programming skills in the following will be needed to fulfill this contract:

SQL Server for the database

PHP or Coldfusion for the website

API development for user authentication and integration





2.3   Hardware and Software Needed

The contractor will need to provide all their own hardware and software for developing this online database application.  The contractor will be provided access to the University of Montana’s server through the wilderness.net domain as needed to develop and test the online application.  The contractor will need to go through the University of Montana’s screening and security procedures prior to accessing the University’s server.



2.4   Coordinate with data managers from other Experimental Forests and Ranges within the data network system to ensure compatibility between all collaborating units.  This work will require a high level of collaboration 



2.5  Coordinate with other data network system coordinators on developing websites and links between sites for data networking.  This portion of the contract will require the contract employee to take a lead role for the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest 





3.0   DELIVERABLES:  

An online database that fulfills the two goals of this contract, as stated above.



New Online Database Functionality

The following components are not developed in the current desktop database and they will need to be developed and included in the online version that is developed under this contract:

User Access and Database Use

Only users with permission will be allowed to enter data into the online database; authentication will be managed through the Ning API for Wilderness.Connect that is hosted on the server at the University of Montana.  Users will be able to enter and edit data only for the wilderness they have been approved for and not be able to make edits to another wilderness or to other units of a different agency.

The database will be developed using SQL Server and will be hosted on the server at the University of Montana that supports both PHP and Coldfusion.

Upon launching the online database, the user will see only the user-interface and work only in this user interface.  All data entered into the online database will be saved to the online server.



Add a Fifth Quality 

A fifth quality of wilderness character will need to be added to the online database (the current desktop version has four qualities of wilderness character).  This fifth quality will be called “Other Features of Value” and will be integrated into the online database exactly as the other four qualities are currently implemented in the desktop Access version.  The only exception is that for this fifth quality there are no standard indicators as there are for the other four qualities so the online database will need to allow users to enter their own indicator(s) for this fifth quality.



Create of Library of Existing Measures

All measures entered into the database need to be compiled into a “library” so any new user can see what other measures have been created by other users. 

The user needs the option of using a measure as it currently is defined, or to modify the existing definition and then save it as a new measure.  The name of the person, their agency, and the wilderness they are developing the measure for needs to be apparent for any user modifying an existing measure.



Documentation to Help Users

The User Guide to using this database needs to be available through a link on every screen.

Agency guidance documents and protocols need to be available through a drop-down menu that is accessible on the measure “library” screen, the select measure screen, the measure definition screen, and the measure value screen.



Analysis

Regression analysis needs to be built into the database to compute the trend for all measures that have 5 or more years of data entered into the database.



Additional Materials

A checkbox will be included on the measure value screen for GIS data (e.g., shapefile) that are available for the measure and if so, a web-link is provided for users to access this GIS layer.  This additional material will not be hosted in this database.

A checkbox will be included on the measure value screen for photos that are available for the measure and if so, a web-link is provided for users to access these photos.  This additional material will not be hosted in this database.

A checkbox will be included on the measure value screen for additional documents that are available for the measure and if so, a web-link is provided for users to access these additional documents.  This additional material will not be hosted in this database.



Reporting

A design template needs to be developed that will allow reports to be generated and printed, or exported as a Microsoft Word docx file and an Adobe pdf file, that follow the example reports published in Technical Guide for Monitoring Selected Conditions Related to Wilderness Character (pages 259 ff) available at [http://leopold.wilderness.net/pubs/785.pdf] for an individual wilderness, a region, or an agency based on the data that are currently in the online database.

An online-only report needs to be developed that will allow a user to click on the overall trend in wilderness character for a wilderness to reveal the trends in the qualities that make up this overall trend, and then click on the trends for each quality to reveal the trends in the indicators that make up this quality trend, and then click on the trend for each indicator to reveal the trend and the data for each measure that make up this indicator.

A query builder needs to be developed that will allow a user to select any number of wildernesses and the data fields of interest, and have the data/information exported to a Microsoft Excel xlsx file.





Timeframe

From the date of the final signature on the contract, the following timelines will be used:

Draft online version of the database will be delivered within 4 months.

This draft online version will be reviewed and comments provided to the contractor within 1 month of delivery of the draft version.

A final online version will be delivered within 1 month of receiving review comments.

	

	

4.0   GOVERNMENT FURNISHED RESOURCES



There will be no local use of the Forest Service office, no use of Forest Service computing equipment, no Forest Service ID or Key card will be issued, and no travel funding will be provided.

____________________________________________________________________________________



ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:



HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month



VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or

successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service

includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or

successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the

performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)



HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther

King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,

Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A

contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in

accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4.174)







THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:



1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does

not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,

administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because

most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate

not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per

week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.

400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations

within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not

list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey

data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds

$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For

example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties

within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer

occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,

then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage

determination.



Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer

industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer

professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees

who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:

    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including

consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional

specifications;

    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or

modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and

related to user or system design specifications;

    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer

programs related to machine operating systems; or

    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which

requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).



2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you

work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential

and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.

 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your

regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday

premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime

(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered

overtime work).





HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees

employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or

in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This

includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive

ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder

and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.

  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations

on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations

involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.



A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that

represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to

ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials

which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the

employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the

like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.

All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and

incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials

are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for

ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.



** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **



If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract

(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or

local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an

employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage

determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the

following standards as compliance:



The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an

adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual

cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made

the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to

this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining

agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary

affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning

and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in

those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"

materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do

not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial

laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms

of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.



The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the

"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,

unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A

links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.

gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at

http://wdol.gov/.



REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form

1444 (SF 1444)}



Conformance Process:



The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is

not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to

be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage

determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable

relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted

classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such

conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the

fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by

the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)

of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall

be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}

When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444

should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be

conformed.



The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:



1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed

occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).



2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order

proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each

proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage

rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the

authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized

representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees

performs any contract work.



3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report

of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent

information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage

and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,

for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).



4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or

disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or

notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process

the request.



5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.



6) The contractor informs the affected employees.



Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.



When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of

Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure

that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the

wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that

determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.

Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide

classifications listed in the wage determination.
