Appendix A - PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS

The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that
is required by Federal Regulations.  Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system
called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes.  The ratings and definitions used in this
questionnaire are identical to those used in CPARS.

Rating                 Definition
Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished
                       with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.

Very Good   Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished
                       with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.

Satisfactory     Performance meets contractual requirements. The element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective
                       actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.

Marginal    Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the
                       contractor has not yet identified corrective actions.

Unsatisfactory   Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The element being
                       assessed contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.



Appendix B – PERFORMANCE AREA DEFINITIONS

The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that
is required by Federal Regulations.  Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system
called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes.  The performance areas and definitions used in
this questionnaire are identical to those used in CPARS.

Quality of Product/Service – Assess the contractor’s conformance to contract/order requirements, specifications and standards of good
workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). For example:  Are reports/data
accurate?  Does the product or service provided meet the specifications of the contract/order?  Does the Contractor’s work measure up to
commonly accepted technical or professional standards?  Assess the degree of customer (Government or Commercial) technical direction required to
solve problems that arise during performance.

For Operations Support: Assess how successfully the contractor meets program quality objectives such as ability to produce, reliability,
maintainability and ability to inspect.  The evaluator must be flexible in how contractor success is measured; e.g., using data from field
reliability and maintainability and failure reports, user comments, and acceptance rates, and scrap and rework rates.  Did the contractor
demonstrate continuous improvement, quality and reliability leadership that reflects progress in quality management?

Schedule – Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the competition of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and
administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance).
This evaluation of the contractor’s adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor’s efforts during the evaluation
period that contributes to or effects the schedule variance.  This element applies to contract/order closeout activities as well as contract
performance.  Instances of adverse actions such as assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and
Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract/order schedule and should therefore be noted
in the evaluation.

Cost Control (Not required for Firm Fixed Price or Firm Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment) – Assess the contractor’s effectiveness in
forecasting, managing, and controlling contract/order cost. For example, does the contractor keep within the total estimated cost (what is the
relationship of the negotiated costs and budgeted costs to actuals)?  Did the contractor do anything innovative that resulted in cost savings?
Were billings current, accurate and complete?  Are the contractor’s budgetary internal controls adequate?

Business Relations – Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract/order, specifically the timeliness,
completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor’s history of reasonable and
cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of
subcontracts.
Include, as applicable, information on the following:
    • Is the contractor oriented toward the customer?

    • Is interaction between the contractor and the customer satisfactory or does it need improvement?

    • Include the adequacy of the contractor’s accounting, billing, and estimating systems and the contractor’s management of customer property
      if a substantial amount of property has been provided to the contractor under the contract/order.

    • Address the timeliness of awards to subcontractors and management of subcontractors, including subcontract costs.  Consider efforts taken
      to ensure early identification of subcontract problems and the timely application of corporate resources to preclude subcontract problems
      from impacting overall prime contractor performance.

    • Assess the prime contractor’s effort devoted to managing subcontracts and whether subcontractors were an integral part of the contractor’s
      team.



   Management of key Personnel (Applicable when the contract/order contains a Key Personnel clause) – Assess the contractor’s performance in
   selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel.
   For example, how well did the contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract/order, with the person who
   filled the key position/  Di the contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively ?  If a key person did not perform
   well, what action was taken by the contractor to correct this?  If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or
   exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract/order schedule?


   Utilization of Small Business (Applicable only to Government contracts with small business clauses) – FAR subpart 19.7 and 15 U.S.C. 637
   contain statutory requirements for complying with the Small Business subcontracting Program.  Assess whether the Contractor provided maximum
   practicable opportunity for Small Businesses to participate in contract/order performance consistent with efficient performance of the
   contract/order.
   Assess compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract/order relating to Small Business participation (including FAR 52.219-8,
   Utilization of Small businesses and FAR 52.219-9, small b=business Subcontracting Plan (when required)).  Assess any Small Business
   participation goals, to include AbilityOne goals, which are stated separately in the contract/order.  Assess achievement on each individual
   goal stated within the contract/order of subcontracting plan including good faith effort if the goal was not achieved.

HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template



Purpose:



This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human Services





Background:



In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508.  The result of their collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template – a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not meet the various Section 508 Requirements.





How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized:



This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) 



The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables.  The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product’s overall “level-of-conformance” with the Section 508 Standards.  Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a Section 508 Standard is composed of.  It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not comply with a specific requirement.



Understanding the columns



Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template’s tables:

 





What information do I enter in columns 2 and 3?



The Supporting Features and Remarks/Explanations columns are used to document exactly how a product did or did not meet the Section 508 Standards. 

















Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template:



To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company’s technical specialist for the product being sought for purchase.  HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses.  Once you have enlisted their assistance:



Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C – 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D – 1194.41) sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template. 



For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements.



Using the information found in the  section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.



If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support the standard.



If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability. 



If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly how the product did not meet the standard.

SECTION C - Description/Specifications C.1 STATEMENT OF WORK The purpose of this requirement is to procure the improvement and maintenance of a clearinghouse that builds upon the attributes of the previously funded National Responsible Fatherhood Clearinghouse (NRFC) www.fatherhood.gov. The authorizing legislation requires that the contract be awarded to "a nationally recognized, non-profit fatherhood promotion organization." The contractor will be responsible for the development of a clearinghouse, a media campaign and the support of the Healthy Marriage and Responsible Fatherhood programs and initiatives. C.2. Background

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), an operating division within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for federal programs that promote the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals and communities. ACF programs serve families and individuals to improve their economic independence and productivity. The Office of Family Assistance (OFA) is located within ACF and oversees the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program which was created by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Also, OFA is the federal office that administers the Healthy Marriage Promotion and Responsible Fatherhood Programs, which are reauthorized by the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (CRA) (Pub. L. 111-291), that amends Title IV, Section 403(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 603(a)(2). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and CRA also authorize a national clearinghouse. They both specify the type of organization eligible to compete for funding to develop a national clearinghouse and media campaign to promote and support marriage and responsible fatherhood. Sections (C)(ii)(IV) provided in pertinent part, that: (IV) Activities to promote responsible fatherhood that are conducted through a contract with a nationally recognized, nonprofit fatherhood promotion organization, such as the development, promotion and distribution of a media campaign to encourage the appropriate involvement of parents in the life of any child and specifically the issues of responsible fatherhood, and the development of a national clearinghouse to assist states and communities in efforts to promote and support marriage and responsible fatherhood.

The legislative mandate to operate a clearinghouse and media campaign guides OFA's intent to procure services in support of Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Marriage within the context of fatherhood, economic stability and parenting. Several studies and literature reviews document the benefits of healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood relative to positive outcomes for children. In general, the research shows the following:  Linkages between family structure and parents' marital status with children's well-being are very consistent. The majority of children who are not raised by both biological parents manage to grow up without serious problems, especially after a period of adjustment for children whose parents divorce. Yet, on average, children in single-parent
Page 5 of 74

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00349

families are more likely to have problems than are children who live in intact families headed by two biological parents.1  Even very young children who have experienced high father involvement show an increase in curiosity and in problem solving capacity. Fathers' involvement seems to encourage children's exploration of the world around them and confidence in their ability to solve problems.2 Highly involved fathers also contribute to increased mental dexterity in children, increased empathy, less stereotyped sex role beliefs and greater self-control.3 When non-custodial fathers are highly involved with their children's learning, the children are more likely to get A's at all grade levels.4

 

OFA believes that healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood are both integral to improve child well-being, build strong healthy families and strengthen communities. Neither is mutually exclusive, therefore OFA expects that the contractor clearly demonstrate the parity between healthy marriage, relationships and responsible fatherhood. OFA requires that the contractor for a national clearinghouse collaborate with any healthy marriage and relationship resource center, or similar entity funded by OFA in order to promote the relevant and necessary initiative synergy. The CRA authorizes funding on a competitive basis to states, territories, Indian tribes and tribal organizations and public and nonprofit community entities, including religious organizations, for activities promoting responsible fatherhood. Authorized Activities to promote responsible fatherhood means the following: (I) Healthy Marriage - Activities to promote marriage or sustain marriage through activities such as counseling, mentoring, disseminating information about the benefits of marriage and 2-parent involvement for children, enhancing relationship skills, education regarding how to control aggressive behavior, disseminating information on the causes of domestic violence and child abuse, marriage preparation programs, premarital counseling, marital inventories, skills-based marriage education, financial planning seminars, including improving a family's ability to effectively manage family business affairs by means such as education, counseling, or mentoring on matters related to family finances, including household management, budgeting, banking, and handling of financial transactions and home maintenance, and divorce education and reduction programs, including mediation and counseling.

(b) To gain routine physical access to an HHS facility, logical access to an HHS-controlled information system, and/or access to sensitive data or information, the Contractor and its employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget memorandum (M-05-24); and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201; and with the personal identity verification and investigation procedures contained in the following documents: (1) HHS Information Security Program Policy. (2) HHS Office of Security and Drug Testing, Personnel Security/ Suitability Handbook, dated February 1, 2005. (3) HHS HSPD-12 Policy Document, v. 2.0. (4) Note: Based upon information provided by the Project Officer, the Contracting Officer shall insert references to OPDIV and/or local procedural guideline(s), if any; indicate if they are readily accessible to the public; and, if so, specify where they may be found. If they are not readily accessible, the Contracting Officer shall attach a copy to the solicitation and contract and reference the guideline(s) here. (c) This contract/order will entail the following position sensitivity level(s): Level 5. Note: At the time of solicitation, based upon information provided by the Project Officer, the Contracting Officer shall specify all known levels. If the position sensitivity levels are not known at that time, the Contracting Officer shall insert the words ``To Be Determined at the Time of Award.'' However, the Contracting Officer must include the definitive position sensitivity levels in the awarded contract/order. (d) The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that the Contractor prepare and submit background check/investigation forms based on the type of investigation required. The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) with fingerprinting. More restricted positions--i.e., those above non-sensitive, require more extensive documentation and investigation. As part of its proposal, and if the anticipated position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (c) above, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer of (1) its proposed personnel who will be subject to a background check/investigation and (2) whether any of its proposed personnel who will

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00349

work under the contract have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background investigations. (e) Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays--see FAR 52.249-14. Accordingly, if position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (c), the Offeror shall ensure that the employees it proposes for work under this contract have a reasonable chance for approval. (f) Typically, the Government investigates personnel at no cost to the Contractor. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the additional investigation(s). (g) The Contractor shall include language similar to this ``HHS-Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security'' language in all subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have the same frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS-controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3). (h) The Contractor shall direct inquiries, including requests for forms and assistance, to the Contracting Officer or designee. (i) Within 7 calendar days after the Government's final acceptance of the work under this contract, or upon termination of the contract, the Contractor shall return all identification badges to the Contracting Officer or designee.''

I.8 352.231-70 SALARY RATE LIMITATION (AUGUST 2012) (a) Pursuant to the current and applicable prior HHS appropriations acts, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the Federal Executive Schedule Level in effect on the date the funding was obligated (the effective date of the contract action). Funding obligated on or after December 23, 2011 cannot be used to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of Federal Executive Schedule Level II. (b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms "direct salary",'' salary", and "institutional base salary'', have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as "direct salary'', in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs). Note: The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under an HHS contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with contract funds. (c) The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts. If this is a multiple-year contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding. (d) See the salaries and wages pay tables on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Web site for Federal Executive Schedule salary levels that apply to the current and prior periods.

L.4 352.239-73(A) ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (JANUARY 2010) (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any federal department or agency permit(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and (2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. (b) Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm. (c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website

(http://www.hhs.gov/od/). (d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense.

SECTION M - Evaluation Factors for Award

M.1 GENERAL In order for proposals to be considered acceptable and eligible for evaluation, they must be prepared in accordance with and in compliance with the instructions given in this RFP and address all of the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work/Description of Requirement. Proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government's scope of work will not be eligible for an award. M.2 AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS AND COMPETITIVE RANGE DETERMINATIONS The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except for clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In the event discussions are held, a competitive range determination will be made. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. M.3 BASIS FOR AWARD The following factors will be considered in evaluating proposals, in descending level of importance: - Technical; - Cost; - Past Performance and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation. Award will be made to that responsible Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those factors offering the best overall value to the Government utilizing tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1. This will be determined by comparing differences in technical merit, past performance and small disadvantaged business participation with differences in cost to the Government. In making this comparison the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical merit. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher cost to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical merit and past performance. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the offeror with a higher technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

M.5 PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. This evaluation is subjective and will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Offeror (for themselves, predecessor companies, key personnel, and major subcontractors), as well as information obtained by other sources known to the Government. For the purpose of this

Page 69 of 74

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00349

evaluation the term "offeror" is inclusive of the prime, predecessor companies, key personnel and subcontractors for which past performance will be evaluated. Relevancy Relevancy will be evaluated based on the size, scope and complexity of the offeror's past performance and how it compares to the services specified in Section C of this RFP. As the relevancy of past performance increases the significance of the reference also increases. Performance Ratings The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations. Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes. To determine how well the offeror has performed in the past, the Government is using past performance rating information available in PPIRS as well as information provided through questionnaires and direct communication with references. The following performance areas will be rated: Quality of Product/Service - Contractor's conformance to contract/order requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). Schedule - The timeliness of the contractor against the competition of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). Cost Control (Not required for Firm Fixed Price or Firm Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment) - Contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract/order cost. Business Relations - Integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract/order, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts. Management of Key Personnel (Applicable when the contract/order contains a Key Personnel clause) - Contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. Utilization of Small Business - Whether the contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Businesses to participate in contract/order performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract/order. Including compliance with all terms and conditions

Page 70 of 74

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00349

in the contract/order relating to Small Business participation, small business participation goals, and AbilityOne goals (when required). Other Areas - Additional evaluation areas that are unique to the contract/order or that could not be captured elsewhere. References are able to rate other areas that are unique to the contract or that cannot be captured elsewhere by adding a field to the CPARS evaluation that transmits to PPIRS or to the past performance questionnaire. All information provided will be taken into consideration when evaluating an offeror's past performance.

The rating scheme for how well an offeror has performed is identical to the rating scheme used by evaluators in CPARS. PERFORMANCE RATING EVALUATION SCHEME: Rating Exceptional Definition Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. Performance meets contractual requirements. The element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory. Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The element being assessed contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

Offerors will have an opportunity to respond to adverse past performance information for which they have not previously had an opportunity to respond. Confidence Level

Page 71 of 74

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00349

After considering both the relevancy of the past performance and the quality of performance, an overall confidence level will be determined for each offer based on the degree of risk of unsatisfactory performance. The more relevant the references are to the current acquisition, the more significant the reference becomes and the more weight it is given in determining the confidence level. The Government will consider the work to be performed by the prime, subcontractors, key personnel, and/or major subcontractors to determine the significance of their particular past performance information when determining the confidence level. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. CONFIDENCE LEVEL EVALUATION SCHEME: Confidence Level Very Low Performance Risk Description Based on the offeror's performance record, no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No performance record is identifiable.

M.6 SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN EVALUATION The SDB participation plan will be evaluated on those offers determined to be technically acceptable, based on the offeror's technical proposal and the evaluation criteria listed in Section M. The Government reserves the right to evaluate SDB participation plans for technically unacceptable offerors if it is determined to be in the Government's best interest. In order to be evaluated favorably the SDB must be an SDB under NAICS industry subsector for the tasks that the SDB is being proposed to accomplish. In order for a Small Disadvantaged

Page 72 of 74

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00349

Business submitting a proposal as a prime to get these points, it must also provide a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan. Offerors will be evaluated subjectively on the following sub-factors: - The extent of an Offeror's commitment to use SDB concerns (10 points) Commitments should be as specific as possible, i.e. are subcontract arrangements already in place, letters of commitment, etc. Specific SDB concerns must be identified with points of contact and phone numbers. Enforceable commitments will be weighed more heavily than non-enforceable ones. The extent of participation of all SDB concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition must be identified. The extent to which minimum target goals (as indicated in Section L. will be met will be considered. Offerors will be given greater credit for targets exceeding the minimum target specified for this requirement, as long as the targets are realistic. Targets expressed as dollars and percentage of total contract value for each SDB participating will be incorporated into and become part of any resulting contract. - The complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform (5 points) Greater weight will be given for arrangements where the SDB shall be performing a greater variety of work, and work of greater complexity. - Past performance of the Offeror in complying with sub-contracting plans for SDB Concerns and monetary targets for SDB participation (5 points) An Offeror with an exceptional record of participation with SDB concerns will receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable. The SDB Participation Plan is separate from the Small Business Subcontracting Plan. M.6 PRICE/COST EVALUATION Offeror(s) price/cost proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. The proposed cost will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism and cost reasonableness. Cost realism is defined as the offeror's ability to project costs which are realistic for the work to be performed, indicate that the offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal. The total evaluated cost for each offeror will be the Total Estimated Costs (including fixed fee) for the entire Period of Performance. The proposed costs will be evaluated by analysis of the costs per year due to increases, escalations, changes in the scope etc. M.7 RESPONSIBILITY To be eligible for award, an Offeror must be determined responsible in accordance with the

Page 73 of 74

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00349

standards in FAR Part 9.104. M.8 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST If the Government determines that an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) exists, that cannot be satisfactorily avoided, neutralized or mitigated or waived, the Contracting Officer may determine that the offeror will not be eligible for award. The Government reserves the right to only consider mitigation plans proposed by the apparent successful offeror. If this acquisition is governed by FAR Part 15, the process of approving an OCI mitigation plan and revisions to such a plan does not constitute discussions as described in FAR 15.306. M.9 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. (FEB 1998) This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es): http://www.acquisition.gov/far/ 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS. (JUL 1990)
