|(E) = EXCELLENT:                      |Based on the Offeror’s performance record, no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the        |
|                                      |required effort.  A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in their statements that|
|                                      |the Offeror’s performance was superior and they would definitely do business with the Offeror again.             |
|(G) = GOOD:                           |Based on the Offeror’s performance record, little doubt exists that he Offeror will successfully perform the     |
|                                      |required effort.  Most sources of information state that the Offeror’s performance was good or better than       |
|                                      |average and that they would do business with the Offeror again.                                                  |
|(A) = ACCEPTABLE:                     |Based on the Offeror’s performance record, it is the general opinion that the Offeror may be able to perform the |
|                                      |required effort successfully.  All sources of information state that the Offeror’s performance was satisfactory, |
|                                      |but did not provide any additional benefit beyond meeting the minimum requirements, and would probably do        |
|                                      |business with the Offeror again.                                                                                 |
|(U) = UNACCEPTABLE:                   |Based on the Offeror’s performance record, serious doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the   |
|                                      |required effort.  A significant majority of sources of information consistently stated that the Offeror’s        |
|                                      |performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the Offeror again.              |

   BACKGROUND


The United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) fosters innovation and competitiveness by providing high quality and timely examination of
patent and trademark applications, guiding domestic and international intellectual property policy, and delivering intellectual property
information and education worldwide.  Completion of this mission necessitates the use of audio/visual communications tools comprised of computer-
based training (CBT), web casts, video productions, multimedia presentations, Internet/Intranet sites, video broadcasts, and the like.

USPTO’s Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) Accessibility Program addresses the requirement to ensure that individuals with disabilities
who are either USPTO employees using EIT resources, or members of the public seeking USPTO information or services, have equivalent access to
these resources.  Equivalent access means that the individual with the disability has access to, and use of, information and data comparable to
that of a person without a disability.  In general, an EIT system is accessible to people with disabilities if it can be used in a variety of
ways that do not depend on a single sense or ability. For example, a system that provides output only in audio format would not be accessible to
people with hearing impairments.
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended in 1998 requires Federal agencies to ensure that any time the Government maintains,
procures, develops, or uses EIT, that it is accessible to persons with disabilities.  The enforcement provision of Section 508 (i.e.,
administrative complaints or civil actions) applies only when a Federal agency procures goods or services. The provisions of Section 508 cover
Federal employees and members of the public that are seeking information from the Government.
In support of USPTO’s EIT Accessibility Program and Section 508, USPTO seeks captioning and transcription services as further described below.

   PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

The contractor shall perform services as described below and in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).

1 Scope of Services

    The scope of services entails contractor support for live captioning and high quality transcription.  The scope of this work includes full
    synchronized text transcripts or captioning in computer-based training (CBT), requiring a full text transcript text file formatted by slide
    number; and video services for various virtual events, including live web casts that involve the use of Adobe Connect and its live
    captioning pod.

2 Primary Tasks

      The contractor shall perform the following services:

1 Transcription Services

      USPTO will provide any associated PowerPoint slides, glossaries, or other available text content associated with the audio presentation via
      email, Internet link, or via contractor-provided FTP to aid with transcription terminology.  NOTE:  USPTO is unable to provide a FTP site
      for use for this requirement, and emails are limited to 5MB in size for both sent and received email.


      If FTP is the preferred method of file transfer provided, the files from the FTP site may be archived for two weeks, and shall be removed
      from the site upon completion of the transcription in order.  Adequate space shall be maintained on the FTP site to accommodate uploaded
      audio files to prevent delays due to an inability to upload audio files because of lack of space.


      While audio files may be sent via Contractor-provided FTP or other preferred method, the Contractor shall have the capability to also
      receive audio via other media.  Other media capability shall include miniDV tape, DVCAM tape, VHS tape, CD, and DVD media.  The Contractor
      shall be capable of receiving various audio file formats such as:  .flv, .swf, .mov, .wmf, and .mp3.  When provided as a digital file, the
      audio file for an order will consist of a single file.




      When slide numbers are provided and transcribed, the text for each slide number and associated transcript for that slide shall be set off
      with formatting in a new paragraph to make it clear when the text for each slide begins and ends.



      1 Expedited Copy Orders

       Transcription text file must be received by USPTO by close of business (COB) the next business day following receipt of the audio file or
       other media and order by the Contractor.


       No advance notice is required.  Expedited Copy Orders must be specifically requested, and shall not be charged as such if not
       specifically ordered as “Expedited”.


       The contractor is required to provide transcription of recordings up to 240 minutes in length.

2 Daily Copy Orders

       Transcription text file must be received by USPTO by COB two (2) business days following receipt of the audio file(s) or other media and
       order by the Contractor.


       USPTO will notify the vendor at least 24 hours in advance of a Daily Copy Order request.  The notification will be via email or phone.


       The Contractor is required to provide transcription of recordings up to 240 minutes in length.

3 Regular Copy Orders

       Transcription text file must be received by USPTO by COB three (3) business days after the audio file(s) or other media and order are
       received by the Contractor.


       USPTO is not required to provide advance notice of a regular copy order.


       The Regular Copy Order pricing shall be applied as default pricing unless a Daily or Expedited Copy Order is specifically requested in
       the order.  The Regular Copy Order may be longer than 240 minutes.

2 Captioning Services


1 Live Real Time Captioning Services

       Live real-time captioning services for live events will be provided for the Adobe Connect Captioning Pod and for other live Line 21

       captioning pod.


       Captioning services shall be Section 508 Compliant.


       The USPTO will provide any associated PowerPoint or other existing text or glossaries in advance of the live event.


       The UPSTO will provide at least one business day advance notice for the live event.


       Same day live captioning may be requested for an additional fee as identified in Section 2.

2 High Quality Transcripts of Live Captioning

       Upon special request the captioning performed for live events shall be edited and provided as a high quality transcript.


       If necessary, associated audio files will be provided if slide number breaks are required.


       The opportunity for USPTO to order high quality transcripts shall remain available for two months following the live event.


       High quality transcripts shall be offered as Expedited, Daily, or Regular, as detailed under Section 3.2.1, Transcription Services,
       above.

3 Ordering Procedures

    Ordering Procedures shall be in accordance with the Contractor’s proposal, as negotiated and agreed upon.

4 Reporting Requirements

        right to require Contractor personnel to sign in upon ingress and sign out upon egress to and from the Government facility.
        DUPLICATION AND DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA
        Duplication or disclosure of confidential data provided by the USPTO or to which the Contractor will have access as a result of this
        contract is prohibited. It is understood that throughout performance of the contract the Contractor may have access to confidential data
        which is the sole property of the USPTO, as well as access to proprietary data which is the sole property of other than the contracting
        parties. The Contractor hereby agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all such data to which access may be obtained throughout
        contract performance whether title thereto vests in the USPTO or otherwise. The Contractor hereby agrees not to disclose said data, any
        interpretations thereof or data derivative therefrom, to unauthorized parties in contravention of these provisions without prior written
        approval of the CO or the party in which title thereto is wholly vested. This clause also applies to any subcontractors and/or
        consultants used by the Contractor.
        GOVERNMENT FURNISHED DATA (IF APPLICABLE)
        The Government shall deliver to the Contractor, as may be requested, Government-Furnished Data (GFD) during the performance of this

        computer programs developed or previously developed and implemented by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, related

        of all software first produced in the performance of this contract.  For the purposes of this clause, "unlimited rights" shall mean the
        right of the USPTO, at no extra cost to the USPTO or recipients, to use, disclose, reproduce unlimited copies, prepare derivative works,
        distribute unlimited copies to the public and foreign government patent offices, and perform publicly and display publicly, in any
        manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit others to do so.
        SECRECY AND USAGE OF PATENT INFORMATION
        Work under this contract does not affect the national security.  However, patent applications are required by law (35 U.S.C. 122) to be
        kept in confidence.  Information contained in any patent application file(s) is restricted to authorized Contractor personnel on a need-
        to-access basis.
        The Contractor acquires no right or privilege to use or disclose any information contained in any patent application file (in any form
        whatsoever) except to perform the work under the contract. Further, the Contractor shall not copyright or make any use or disclosure
        whatsoever of any patent information contained in any application or related copy or data furnished the Contractor by the Government or
        obtained therefrom except performing the requirements of this contract.
        Security requirements of patent application file data maintained in a computer-accessible medium are an extension of the security
        requirements for the hard copy or the patent application folders.  All processing, storage or transmission of patent application file
        data by means of electronic communications systems is prohibited unless use of such systems is approved by the USPTO.
        All personnel having access to patent application files or data or information concerning the same, must take the following affirmation,
        signed in writing:
        “I do swear or affirm that I will preserve the applications for patents in secrecy, that I will not divulge any information concerning
        the same to unauthorized persons while employed in work under this contract or at any time thereafter; and that I take this obligation
        freely, and without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.”
        Each employee’s signed oath, or affirmation, shall be retained in the Contractor's file, subject to inspection by authorized Government
        representatives.
        Without advance notice, the Government shall have the right to inspect the Contractor's premises, records, and work in process
        pertaining to the secrecy of patent information.

6 Confidentiality of Files

    USPTO audio files and other media formats as well as transcribed content shall be kept strictly confidential and by no means released to the
    public.

      (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
    simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
    principals—
        (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
    Federal agency;
        (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
    for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
    government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
    embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal
    criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
        (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
    these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
        (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
    exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
          (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
            (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
    determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability
    is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
            (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
    full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
          (ii) Examples.
            (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
    review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
    Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
            (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a
    notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to
    further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to
    contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent
    tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the
    taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
            (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
    full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
    payment.
            (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed
    under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
      (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list
    in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
    Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

    then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]
          [  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or
    manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.
          [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured
    in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether
    forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis
    of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
      (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
    statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response
    to this solicitation is predominantly—
        (1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States

        (2) o Outside the United States.
      (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance
    with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt
    services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]
        [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not
    certify that—
          (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or
    traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course

    5 PTO-10 - Agency-Level Protest Procedures (DEC 1996)

     a. PURPOSE:
        To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995,
        President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12979, which directs heads of executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for
        resolving protests to awards of procurement contracts within their agencies at a level above the Contracting Officer. Authority to
        administer procurement-related directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the Chief Financial Officer and
        Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Management (Procurement Executive). The Department's goal is to
        encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build confidence in the Government's acquisition system, and
        reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and other external fora. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall
        use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party at the Contracting Officer level through open and frank
        discussions. If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency at a
        level above the Contracting Officer.
     b. DEFINITIONS:
        An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority but not both. When a
        protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the guidelines set forth in these
        established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing
        protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102.
        A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run
        is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is
        not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce are closed for all
        or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Department is open.
     c. PROCEDURES:
        i. Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final decision for the Department. 
           Protests shall be addressed to :
              Chief Financial Officer
              U.S. Patent & Trademark Office
              P.O. Box 1450
              Alexandria, VA  22313-1450
           The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency-level Protest". The protester shall also
           provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the responsible contracting officer and a copy to the addressee indicated below:
              Office of the General Counsel
              General Law Office
              U.S. Patent & Trademark Office
              P.O. Box 1450
              Alexandria, VA  22313-1450
              (FAX Number 571-273-0099)
       ii. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the protester agrees not to
           protest to the Government Accountability  Office (GAO) or any other external forums. If the protester has already filed with the GAO
           or other external forums, the procedures described here may not be used.
           a. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or time set for receipt of
              proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests
              must be filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester was given the opportunity to be
              debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two sentences, protests shall be filed not
              later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.
           b. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Amy protests received after that time will be
              considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered filed until all information is provided.
           c. To be complete, protests must contain the following information:
              1. the protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number
              2. the solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer
              3. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced
              4. copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statement
              5. a request for ruling by the agency
              6. Statement as to form of relief requested
              7. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest
              8. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest
              9. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester.  Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the
                 Contracting Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the issues raised by the protester and addresses any
                 other issues, which, even if not raised by the protester, have been identified by agency officials as being relevant to the
                 fairness of the procurement process. For good cause shown, the protest decision authority may grant an extension of time for
                 filing the administrative report and for issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision
                 authority will notify the protester and all interested parties within I day of the decision to grant the extension.  Unless an
                 extension is granted, the protest decision authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest decision
                 authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of Commerce and not subject to further appeals.  The protest
                 decision authority shall send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by certified
                 mail, return receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting office and Office of Acquisition
                 Management. 
     iii. Effect of protest on award and performance:  When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by
          the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that:
     a. The supplies or services are urgently required,
          b. delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly, or
          c. a prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government.
        When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the protester under a
        timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.506, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer shall immediately suspend
        performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including any review by an independent higher official, unless
        continued performance is justified. The HCA may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding
        that:
          d. contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or
          e. urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a
             decision.
     d. REMEDIES:
      The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies:
        i. terminate the contract,
       ii. re -compete the requirement,
      iii. issue a new solicitation,
       iv. refrain from exercising options under the contract,
        v. award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations,
       vi. amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue with the procurement,
      vii. such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to correct a defect.
                                                               (End of provision.)

   EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS


1 Evaluation

        a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the
           solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to
           evaluate offers, in descending order of importance:


                   Factor 1:  Technical
                       1.a.:  Technical Capability
                       1.b.:  Technical Work Plan
                       1.c.:       Technical Demonstration
                   Factor 2:      Past Performance
                     Factor 3:    Price

      Technical is more important than past performance, which is more important than price.
       (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for
    acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in an agreement without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified
    expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a
    written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
                                                                (End of provision)

2 Evaluation Two-Step Process

    Offerors will be initially evaluated based on Factor 1.a, 1.b., Factor 2 and Factor 3.  For purposes of efficiency in the evaluation
    process, a competitive range of the highest rated vendors will be established.  Only those vendors in the competitive range will be
    requested to submit a demonstration of their capabilities, when Factor 1.c will be evaluated.  Discussions will be held only with those
    vendors.  
                                                                (End of provision)





    3 Best Value Determination

    The USPTO will make an award resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer will be the most advantageous and
    represents the best value to the USPTO, price and other factors considered.  In making the best value determination, the USPTO will evaluate
    technical, past performance, and price.  The USPTO shall determine what tradeoff among these factors provides the greatest value to the
    USPTO.


    It is anticipated that only one (1) BPA will be awarded as a result of this solicitation, but USPTO maintains the right to award more than
    one BPA if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.
                                                                (End of provision)


                                                               END OF SOLICITATION
