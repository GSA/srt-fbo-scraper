(a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:

(1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;

 

(2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person;

 (5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,

 (6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.

 (b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden “compliance with the boycott”, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)’s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above:

 (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:

 (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,

 (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;

 (2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;

 (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;

 (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;

 (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual’s family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,

 (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.

K.4	52.209-5  CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)



(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that— 

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals— 

(A) Are [   ] are not [   ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(B) Have [   ]  have not [   ] within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 

(C) Are [   ] are not [   ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 

(D) Have [   ] have not [   ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(2) Examples. 

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

 

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 

(ii) The Offeror has [   ] has not [   ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 

(2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 

THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE. 

(b) 	The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 



(c) 	A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 

(d) 	Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

 

(e) 	The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 



K.5	52.215-6  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE (OCT 1997)



The offeror or respondent, in the performance of any contract resulting from this solicitation, [   ]  intends, [   ]  does not intend [check applicable block] to use one or more plants or facilities located at a different address from the address of the offeror or respondent as indicated in this proposal or response to request for information.

K.11	ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION

 AND DISCLOSURE

 

The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that it is [  ], [  ] is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any potential organization conflict of interest, as defined in FAR 9.501, which relates to the work to be performed pursuant to this solicitation.  As used herein, “Offeror” means the proposer or any of its affiliates or proposed consultants or subcontractors of any tier.



If the Offeror is aware of any such information, the Offeror shall provide a disclosure statement as part of the proposal which describes in a concise manner all relevant facts concerning any past, present, or planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed hereunder and bearing on whether the Offeror may have a potential organizational conflict of interest with respect to (1) being able to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advise, or (2) being given an unfair competitive advantage.

If the Contracting Officer determines that a potential conflict exists, the prospective Contractor shall not receive an award unless the conflict can be avoided or otherwise resolved through the inclusion of a special contract clause or other appropriate means.  The terms of any special clause are subject to negotiation.

L.10  MATHEMATICAL DISCREPANCIES



In the event of discrepancy between the unit prices and their extensions, the extensions will be adjusted accordingly.  In the event of discrepancy between the sum of the extended total prices and the total proposal price, the total proposal price will be adjusted accordingly.



L.11	PROPOSAL GUIDELINES



This section provides guidance for preparing proposals and specific instructions on the format and content of the proposal.  The Offeror’s proposal must include all data and information required by Section L and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions.  The Government will read and evaluate only the maximum number of pages allowed.  Non-conformance with the specified organization, content, and page limitations may be cause for proposal rejection.  All claimed technical, management, and schedule capabilities to meet the requirements must be realistic and are subject to verification by the Government.



The proposal must be clear, concise and not be over complicated.  It must include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims.  The proposal shall not simply rephrase or restate the Government’s requirements, but rather provide a convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements.  Proposals that simply restate the Government requirements may be judged non-responsive.  Offerors must assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror’s proposals.



Each volume must be written to the greatest extent possible on a stand-alone basis so that its contents may be evaluated with a minimum of cross-referencing to other volumes of the proposal.  Cross-referencing within proposal volumes is permitted where its use would conserve space without impairing clarity.  Offerors are encouraged to exceed stipulated Government requirements wherever feasible, provide there is no penalty in program schedule, risk, or price.



The Government will not pay any cost for the preparation and/or submission of a proposal(s) in response to this solicitation.



L.11.1	    Volume 1:  Technical Proposal				



Offerors’ proposals must include, at a minimum, the following:



The technical evaluation criteria in Section M of this solicitation will be used by the technical panel to evaluate Technical proposals.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD





M.1   SOLICITATION PROVISIONS 

52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)



The following provisions are incorporated by reference with the same force and effect as if they were provided in full text.  To access the full text electronically, see  or www.statebuy.state.gov/dosar/dosartoc.htm.  If you cannot access either of these sites, the Contracting Officer will make the full text available.





M.2   BASIS FOR AWARD 



The Government will make one award to the responsible Offeror (s) whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The relative importance of the non-cost evaluation factors, in descending order of importance, is:  technical factor, past performance.  The evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The technical proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposal and the offeror’s ability to perform the prospective contract successfully.  Subjective judgment on the part of the Government is implicit in the technical evaluation process.  The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between non-cost factors and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest offered price.  As non-cost factors, when combined, of the offerors’ proposals become more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become more important as a determining factor.  



M.3   AWARD – AGGREGATE BASIS, ALL ITEMS 



The line items in Section B of this solicitation will be awarded on an aggregate basis for all solicitation items.  Only one award will result from this solicitation.  Proposals that do not offer all of the line items specified in Section B will not be eligible for award.



M.4   EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSALS



M.4.1	General.



To be acceptable and eligible for evaluation, proposal must be prepared following the instructions in Section L and must meet all the requirements stated in the solicitation.  The Government may reject any proposal that fails to comply with Section L or includes an unacceptable technical proposal.  The Government will award the contract to the Offeror presenting the best overall value.  The Government will evaluate acceptable proposals as described below.  The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Technical Evaluation Factors (i.e. non-Cost/Price) will be evaluated using an adjectival (Outstanding, Acceptable, Marginal, Unacceptable) rating scheme.  The Non-Technical Evaluation Factor (i.e. Cost/Price) will be evaluated as detailed below.  An “Unacceptable” rating in any factor will result in the elimination of an offeror’s proposal from consideration for award of the contract.  



M.4.2	Evaluation Factors



The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s capability and approach to meet the DOS program objectives against the following evaluation factors that are listed in descending order of importance.   



Technical Approach and Competencies 

Staffing

Past Performance/Experience



For this Request For Proposal (RFP), technical merit (captured in the three evaluation factors enumerated above, taken together) is significantly more important than cost/price. Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between cost/price and technical merit.  As technical merit of the offerors’ proposals becomes more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor.  The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered. Award will be made based upon the best value to the Government. The Department reserves the right to make award without discussions.  However, discussions, if held, will be in the form of written questions, to which the offerors will be required to respond.  The Department may not hold discussions with all offerors.



M.4.3   Rejection of Offers



The Government reserves the right to reject an offer if one (1) of the following conditions exists:



Offeror fails to submit any of the required proposal documents required by Section L.

Offeror submits a cost/price proposal that cannot be adequately explained or substantiated.

Offeror submits an offer that could not be made technically acceptable without a major rewrite.



M.4.4	 Quantities for Evaluation 



For the purpose of evaluation, and for no other purpose, the Government will evaluate the prices submitted on the basis that the Government will require the quantities shown in Section B.



M.4.5	 Separate Charges 



Separate charges, in any form, are not solicited.  For example, the Government will reject proposals containing any charges for failure of the Government to exercise any options.  The Government shall not be obligated to pay any charges other than the contract price, including any exercised options.



M.4.6   Evaluation Criteria for Evaluation Factor 1:  Technical Approach and Competencies



The offeror’s capability to demonstrate the necessary technical competencies required in meeting the requirements will be evaluated.  The offeror will be evaluated on its overall understanding of the above and how the offeror presents the information in the technical proposal based on the following quality perspectives: clarity, comprehensiveness and completeness.  The offeror will be evaluated on its planned execution of the objectives stated in the task order to include the specific methods and techniques for completing the work described in the PWS.  Finally, the offeror will be evaluated on its capability to manage project costs and schedules. 



The Government will use the following adjectival ratings to evaluate the Technical Approach and Competencies Factor:



Adjectival Ratings for Evaluation Factor 1



M.4.7   Evaluation Criteria for Evaluation Factor 2: Staffing



The offeror will be evaluated on its demonstrated ability to hire and maintain qualified staff with the prerequisite professional qualifications, experiences, and capabilities in the essential aspects of this project. The offeror’s personnel will be evaluated to determine their capacity to perform the required support services.



The Government will use the following adjectival ratings to evaluate the Staffing Factor:



Adjectival Ratings for Evaluation Factor 2







Adjectival Ratings for Evaluation Factor 3



M.5   EVALUATION OF COST/PRICE



Each offeror is advised to submit its most competitive offer. For evaluation purposes only (for award of the contract), the contract price shall be calculated using the quantities specified in Section B and the Offeror’s proposed amounts for the base year and all option years; it does not commit the Government to paying these prices.  Similarly, the Government does not commit to usage of the RFP-specified quantities or expenditure of the RFP-specified Travel cost.  The Government will review and evaluate all cost/pricing information contained within the submitted Cost/Price Proposal.  Offeror cost/price proposals will be evaluated independently and separately from technical proposals.  Cost is an important part of the integrated selection decision and is included in the overall best value decision.  Fair and reasonable pricing will be determine in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.4.  The Government will evaluate all assumptions or exceptions and determine the risk associated with each offeror’s proposal. Offeror shall conduct appropriate cost or price analyses to establish the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices, and shall include the results of these analyses in its price proposal.  Results shall be in the form of the cost/price analysis report(s), which shall include: cost/price analysis technique(s) used (e.g., comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation), summary findings, detailed findings, and basis for the determination of fair and reasonable proposed subcontract prices.  For the Time-and-Materials CLINs, “proposed subcontract prices” shall mean “subcontractor offeror’s proposed or negotiated fully-loaded hourly labor rates.”
