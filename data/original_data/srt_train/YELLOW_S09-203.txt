      forth below, will be applied to each deliverable received from the Subcontractor under this statement of work.

         • Accuracy – Deliverables shall be accurate in presentation, technical content, and adherence to accepted elements of style.
         • Clarity – Deliverables shall be clear and concise. Any/All diagrams shall be easy to understand and be  relevant  to  the  supporting

         • User acceptance – User acceptance for software products will be documented by stakeholders’ signature(s) on software design documents
           and test plan, as well as completed software user testing documentation.  The intent of  involving  stakeholders  at  all  stages  of
           design and testing is to ensure the software performs as per their specific needs  and  meets  the  documented  design  requirements.
           These signatures will represent that the relevant stakeholders have (1) participated in the requirements generation, test design, and
           user testing;(2) ensured the software performs according to the parameters specified  in  the  design  documents;  and  (3)  properly
           executed the approved test plan carried out at their site.
         • Subcontractor User Acceptance – User acceptance for Workspace/Working Group  software  and  solution  development  products  will  be
           documented by Subcontractors’ signature(s)  on  a  sign-off  page  for  source  code.   These  signatures  will  represent  that  the
           Subcontractor:
         o Conducted software or solution development according to defined processes.
         o Conducted quality assurance and quality control activities (e.g., white-box and unit testing) during the development process.

   D. Deliverable Review and Acceptance Process


       Notice of approval/rejection will be sent to the contractor within 30 calendar days of receipt of the deliverable.  If  deliverables  meet
      the acceptance criteria, the SAIC-F Contracting Officer will issue the Subcontractor a written acceptance through email  that  acknowledges
      both receipt and overall acceptance of the deliverable.  Irrespective of payment status for subject deliverable, Subcontractor  should  not
      assume acceptance has been made without formal notification from  the  SAIC-F  Contracting  Officer.   If  deliverables  do  not  meet  the
      acceptance criteria, all issues will be described unambiguously and sent to the Subcontractor  via  email.   The  Subcontractor  will  then
      address each issue or state why the issue may not be addressed and resubmit the deliverable.  Resubmitted  deliverables  will  be  reviewed
      within 15 calendar days.


      Absence of any comments by the SAIC-F CO will not relieve the Subcontractor of the responsibility for complying with requirements  in  this
      statement of work.  Final approval and acceptance of documentation required herein shall be by letter of approval by the  SAIC-F  CO.   The
      Subcontractor shall not construe any letter of acknowledgment of receipt material as a waiver of review or as an  acknowledgment  that  the
      material is in conformance with this.

Seller shall, at its expense, indemnify, defend, save and hold Buyer and its successors,  affiliates,  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,
independent contractors and customers, and the officers, agents and employees of such customers (hereinafter collectively  referred  to  in  this

expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees that result or arise  out  of  or  relate  to,  in  whole  or  part,  any  claims,  suits,
proceedings, actions, causes of action and demands brought against the  Buyer  asserting  that  the  deliverables,  including  without  delivery,

Acceptance or payment of any part of the Order shall not bind Buyer to accept future shipments or performance of services nor  deprive  Buyer  of
the right to return goods already accepted or for which Buyer has made payment.  Acceptance or payment shall not be deemed  to  be  a  waiver  of
Buyer’s right to cancel or return all or any part of the goods because of failure to conform to the  Order  or  by  reason  of  defects,  whether
latent or patent, or other breach of warranty, or to make any claim for damages of any and all kind.

At Buyer’s request, Seller agrees to provide Certificates of Insurance evidencing  that  the  required  insurance  coverages  are  in  force  and
providing not less than thirty days written notice prior to any cancellation or restrictive modification of the policies.

Further, the required insurance coverages below shall be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other insurance that may be  maintained

account of, and at the sole risk of Seller which provides the insurance and to the extent applicable shall be paid by Seller.  In no event  shall

Order, said decision, if binding upon Buyer under the Prime Contract shall in turn be binding upon Buyer and Seller with respect to such  matter;
provided, however, that if Seller disagrees with any such decision made by the NCI Contracting Officer and Buyer elects not to  appeal  any  such
decision, Seller shall have the right reserved to Buyer under the Prime Contract with the Government to prosecute a timely appeal in the name  of
Buyer, as permitted by the contract or by law, Seller to bear its own legal and other costs.  If Buyer elects not to appeal  any  such  decision,

every reasonable manner.  If Buyer elects to appeal any such decision of the NCI Contracting Officer, Buyer agrees to furnish Seller promptly  of

reimbursement from the Government under the Prime Contract for, or is required to refund or credit to the Government, any amount with respect  to
any item or matter for which the Buyer has  reimbursed  or  paid  Seller,  Seller  shall,  on  demand,  promptly  repay  such  amount  to  Buyer.
Additionally, pending the final conclusion of any appeal hereunder, Seller shall, on demand promptly repay any such  amount  to  Buyer.   Buyer's
maximum liability for any matter connected with or related to this Order which was properly the subject of a claim against the  Government  under
the Prime Contract shall not exceed the amount of the Buyer's recovery from the Government.

Seller agrees to provide certification that data supporting any claim made by Seller hereunder is made in good  faith  and  that  the  supporting
data is accurate and complete to the best of the Seller's knowledge or belief, all in accordance with the requirements of the Contracts  Disputes
Act of 1978 (41USC601-613) and implementing regulations. If any claim of Seller is determined to be based on  upon  fraud  or  misrepresentation,
Seller agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Buyer harmless for any and all liability, loss, cost, or expense resulting there from.

Any dispute not addressed in paragraph (A) above, will be subject to paragraph (B) as described below.

(B) Buyer and Seller agree to first enter into negotiations to resolve any controversy, claim or dispute (“dispute”) arising  under  or  relating
to this Order.  The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of such dispute within a reasonable  period
of time.  If good faith negotiations are unsuccessful, Buyer and Seller agree to  resolve  the  dispute  by  binding  and  final  arbitration  in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  The arbitration  shall  take  place  in
the County of Frederick, State of Maryland.  The arbitrator(s) shall be bound to follow the provisions of this Order in  resolving  the  dispute,
and may not award punitive damages.  The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be  final  and  binding  on  the  parties,  and  any  award  of  the
arbitrator(s) may be entered or enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Seller hereby waives any immunity, sovereign or otherwise, that it would otherwise  have  to  such  jurisdiction  and  agrees  that  its  rights,
obligations, and liabilities hereunder shall be determined in the same manner and to the same extent as those of a private  litigant  under  like
circumstances.

All costs of the arbitration shall be shared equally between the Parties, but the Parties specifically agree  that  each  Party  shall  bear  the
expense of any costs incurred by it for its own counsel, experts, witnesses, preparation of documents, presentations, and  logistics  related  to
the proceedings.

Pending any decision, appeal or judgment referred to in this provision or the settlement of any dispute arising under this  Order,  Seller  shall
proceed diligently with the performance of this Order.

All goods furnished and services performed pursuant hereto shall be subject to inspection and test by Buyer at all reasonable times  and  places,
during the Order term, and in any event, prior to Final Acceptance as that term is defined in the Statement of Work.  No  inspection  made  prior
to Final Acceptance shall relieve Seller from responsibility for defects or other to meet the failure requirements of this Order.  In  the  event
that goods furnished or services supplied are not in accordance with the Statement of  Work  and  Schedule  or  other  requirements.   Buyer  may
require Seller to promptly correct, repair, replace or re-perform the goods or services.  The cost of correction,  repair,  replacement,  or  re-
performance shall be determined under Section 7 of this Order.  If Seller fails to proceed with reasonable promptness  to  perform  the  required
correction, repair, replacement, or re-performance, Buyer may terminate the Order for default.  If Seller is unable to accomplish the  foregoing,
then Buyer may procure such materials and services from another source or perform such services in-house  and  charge  to  Seller’s  account  all
costs, expenses and damages associated therewith.  Buyer’s approval of designs furnished by Seller shall not relieve Seller  of  its  obligations
hereunder.

ARTICLE C.1.  STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE




1.    BACKGROUND


The National Cancer Institute (NCI) through its Center for Biomedical Informatics and  Information  Technology  (NCI  CBIIT)  has  sponsored  the
development of the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid® (caBIG®) initiative, a common informatics infrastructure that incorporates and  encourages
the use of common data and service standards. caBIG® is an open source, open access information network connecting the cancer research  community
and enabling the sharing of data and tools.  Using the caBIG infrastructure, researchers and clinicians can accelerate their  ability  to  share,
integrate and analyze  data.   By  providing  a  comprehensive  collection  of  interoperable  software  tools,  data  standards,  and  computing
infrastructure, the caBIG initiative promotes data and knowledge exchange, simplifies collaboration, and ultimately helps realize  the  potential
of molecular medicine.

The main objective of Tissue Banks and Pathology Tools Workspace is to integrate different tissue bank tools, pathology tools  and  other  caBIG®
tools, applications and services to provide a suite of bioinformatics tools that allow researchers to locate, analyze and share  biospecimens  as
well as gather, share, explore, integrate, and reuse data in research and clinical studies.

caTissue Suite is a caBIG® biorepository management tool  designed  for  biospecimen  inventory,  tracking,  and  annotation.  This  tool  allows
biorepositories to track the collection, storage, quality assurance, and distribution of biospecimens as well as data related to the  participant
and study from which biospecimens is collected. It also helps researchers to find and  request  specimens  that  may  be  subsequently  used  for
translational research studies. caTissue’s grid service allows searches to be performed across caTissue installations at multiple  sites  on  the
internet and allows integration with other caBIG applications.  The current version of caTissue  Suite  is  1.1.   This  solicitation  seeks  the
development of caTissue Suite 1.2.

From a technical point of view caTissue is a multiple tiered architecture web application based on Java Platform, Enterprise  Edition  (Java  EE)
with an underlying relational database in MySQL or Oracle. End user access is via a web browser.

In addition their availability as standalone products caBIG bundles, its tools into  two  bundles  a  Life  Sciences  Distribution[1],  in  which
caTissue is a component, and the Clinical Trials Suite. It is expected that caTissue Suite 1.2 will become part of the Clinical Trials Suite.

The wide adoption (see Appendix D) of caTissue urges us to leapfrog to a new stage that provides a new community input model. The  stability  and
maturity of caTissue in the biorepository field provides us an opportunity to exploit the interoperability in caTissue to benefit the  community.
  It is desired that caTissue Suite 1.2 provide better quality, usability, compatibility, interoperability, performance, as well  as  a  list  of
new features/functionalities and a set of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) services on top of a set of existing grid services, which exist  in
the current version of caTissue. Currently caTissue provides grid services to access all existing objects and  their  attributes  in  its  domain
model.

This initiative will use Rational Unified Process and the solicitation/proposal phase will be part of the inception phase that answers  questions
about what to build; identifies key functionalities, costs, schedule, and risks; decides process and tools; and explores possible solutions[2].

Terminology and acronyms used throughout are given in Appendix A.

2.    OBJECTIVES

The lack of standardized, high-quality biospecimens is widely recognized as a significant roadblock to cancer research[3]. The  primary  goal  of
this project is to promote further adoption of caTissue Suite, encouraging data sharing  on  tissue  specimen  collections,  facilitating  tissue
distribution and enhancing collaboration among researchers and clinicians regarding tissue samples and related information.

The primary focus of this release will improve interoperability with other caBIG® products; integrate with  assay  systems  like  caArray,  caBIG
Clinical Trials Suite (CCTS), NCI Enterprise Services (NES), and the Biospecimen Research Database[4]; improve interoperability  by  implementing
the Common Biorepository Model CBM); improve grid compatibility, quality, performance and scalability  by  refactoring  and  re-architecting  the
existing system.

By improving quality and interoperability of Tissue Banking and Pathology Tools, we are  one  step  closer  towards  the  mission  of  Office  of
Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR): to ensure that human biospecimens available for cancer research are of the highest quality;  and
we are one step further in resolving the most difficult problems that will drive 21st  century  cancer  research:  the  limited  availability  of
carefully collected and controlled, high-quality human biospecimens annotated with essential clinical  data  and  properly  consented  for  broad
investigational use[5].

This software is licensed as open source to promote the reuse of existing code, hence optimizing the full benefit of the research dollars  spent.


To be more specific, the objectives of this SOW include:

    • Enhancement and maintenance

         o Refactoring, re-architecting to provide a set of robust, flexible and high performance services.

         o Provide more grid services on top of existing grid data services

         o Improve performance of existing grid services

         o Improve the capacity and scalability of the existing system

         o Address grid compatibility of Dynamic Extensions.

    • Interoperability

   One of the main goals of this initiative is to improve the interoperability of caTissue and  other  applications.  As  part  of  this  effort,
   caTissue will provide a suite of services like Biospecimen Identifier Service and Biospecimen Service; implement and  consume  other  services
   like COPPA. caTissue and other applications such as caArray, CTS PSC/C3PR, BRD will utilize these services to communicate and  integrate  with
   each other. (See Following Graph)


                                                                      [pic]
                                                             caTissue 1.2 Integration

         o Provide global identification of specimens over multiple instances of caTissue. (Identify biospecimens using global identifiers that
           are unique across the grid.)

         o Link between biospecimens and molecular array data over the grid. Integration with assay systems e.g. caArray.

         o Work with NCI Enterprise Service (NES) team to identify requirements that extend COPPA services to satisfy pathology banking needs
           and integrate with available and compatible NES services

         o Integrate with CTS products such as Patient Study Calendar (PSC)

         o Integrate with Biospecimen Research Database (BRD)

         o Implement Common Biorepository Model (CBM)


2.1.  SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

2 2.1.1     Enhance Usability and General Application Enhancement

   The version of caTissue Suite from which development will continue is caTissue Suite 1.1.x. The subcontractor shall fix high priority existing
   defects (See Appendix C).

3 2.1.2     Provide Additional Grid Services Types

   The subcontractor shall extend caTissue’s grid data  services  to  include  the  WS-Enumeration  and  Bulk  Data  Transfer  service  types  as
   appropriate. The data services address all areas of functionality  of caTissue  including:  Annotation,  Consent  Tracking,  Ordering  System,
   Shipping and Tracking, Surgical Pathology Report (SPR), Security.  The proposal shall indicate which variants of a caGRID service (see  caGRID
   user manual) will be provided.


   A more fine grained security mechanism shall be developed whereby a user’s privileges  on  the  grid  as  indicated  by  their  membership  of
   particular grid groups map to appropriate authorization within a local caTissue instance. The data which each grid group  provides  access  to
   shall continue to be determined by each local installation of caTissue.

   The system shall support the count modifier that allows a grid service to return the number of records that a query would obtain  (see  caGrid
   manual).






   caB2B (Bench to Bedside) is a caGrid client that allows queries across grid instances to be performed by scientists who are not experts in the
   details of grids. An important validation of caTissue’s grid data services is that they should be able to be queried through caB2B.

4 2.1.3     Biospecimen Identifier

   The system shall be adapted such that identifiers for specimens are unique across instances of caTissue.  The proposed approach  is  that  all
   caTissue instances obtain specimen and patient identifiers from a central service, likely on a batch basis.


   The system shall have the capability to store identifiers such that day to day operations can be conducted even  if  the  specimen  identifier
   service is unavailable.


   The system shall obtain identifiers automatically at suitable intervals, or as needed to support routine operations, from the central service.
   Failure to obtain identifiers should raise an alert to local administrators.

5 2.1.4     Integrate caTissue with assay systems including caArray

   The system shall make available a service which will allow external systems to download and import identifiers for  specimens  distributed  to
   receiving sites. The Distribution and Distribution Item classes in caTissue are likely to be appropriate classes to support this.

6 2.1.5     Export data into MAGE-TAB format

   The subcontractor shall provide the ability to export annotations for  selected  specimens  to  MAGE-TAB  format  for  eventual  linkage  with
   microarray experiment information and import to caArray.

7 2.1.6     Query/get specimen information

   The subcontractor shall expand existing grid services to return different specimen information by specified criteria. For example, a user  can
   query a set of available specimens by annotation; or  can  retrieve  annotations  by  a  specimen  identifier  etc.  The  subcontractor  shall
   participate in the integration and help other groups consume these services.

1 2.1.6.1   Provide an order submission service

        The subcontractor shall provide a specimen order submission grid service such that other systems can request specimens  programmatically
        under scenarios appropriate to those applications.


        The order fulfillment will return a list of available specimens and start the following steps in the  process  to  track  and  ship  the
        requested specimen.

8 2.1.7     Integrate caTissue with NES

   The subcontractor shall work with NCI Enterprise Service (NES) team to support Enterprise Service integration  over the caGrid as appropriate.


   Some of these services already exist – Person Services, Organization Services, Correlation Services, Protocol  Abstraction  Services.   Others
   services are being developed as part of the next development cycle of the caBIG Cancer Clinical Trial Suite (CCTS) bundle.    Please  see  the
   service integration project plan for planned availability of these services.


   Note that while the CCTS applications will serve as reference implementations for service definitions other  applications  may  implement  the
   services described in their specifications.  caTissue should be able to connect to any application which  implements  the  particular  service
   specifications.


   caTissue should provide configurability as to which instances of any service should be used.

1 2.1.7.1   Implement Specimen Management Services

        The subcontractor shall work through the COTR to establish those aspects of caTissue functionality which it is appropriate to publish as
        a service standard within caBIG such that other applications may also implement them. Appropriate architectural support will be provided
        to describe the services in terms of caBIG’s evolving Enterprise Conformance and Compliance Framework (ECCF).

9 2.1.8     Make Dynamic Extensions Grid Compatible

   The subcontractor shall coordinate with VCDE, architecture team and other groups to make data defined through  caTissue’s  Dynamic  Extensions
   feature grid compatible.


   The Dynamic Extension feature within caTissue shall be enhanced such that those wishing to define new data elements can easily determine  that
   those elements do not already exist.

10 2.1.9    Integrate with CCTS Applications

   The CCTS applications are currently being reengineered to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) whereby services become the system  of  record
   for certain data. This will improve the current situation where each of the applications in the CCTS maintains its own copy of the data. It is
   the intent that caTissue will integrate with the CCTS by use of these services and that there will be appropriate refactoring of  caTissue  to
   implement specimen management services as opposed to storing data internally.


   Certain of the services (see above) required by the CCTS have already been implemented as the NCI Enterprise Services (NES).


   These services would most likely be deployed as part of any particular caTissue Suite installation but may also be located remotely.


   caTissue shall be configurable such that it may be installed with or without the CCTS applications.  Services required by  caTissue  would  be
   installed as part of its own install procedure.

1 2.1.9.1   Integrate with Patient Registry (C3PR)

        The subcontractor shall integrate caTissue with the Cancer Central Clinical Participant Registry (C3PR) such that caTissue and C3PR  use
        a common service for study participants and their registration to particular protocols.

2 2.1.9.2   Integrate with Patient Study Calendar (PSC)

        The subcontractor shall integrate caTissue with the Patient Study Calendar (PSC) such that  both  may  use  a  common  service  for  the
        protocol which defines a study and the steps in that protocol where specimens are collected. The planned and actual specimen  collection
        activities for each participant registered should also be maintained in a common system (service) of record.


        The subcontractor shall integrate caTissue with PSC for following use cases.
               • When a patient/subject is registered to a study/protocol, a subject-specific study calendar  is  created.   Specimen  collection
                 activities should be visible in caTissue and function exactly as the current “Collection Protocol Events” do in  caTissue  Suite
                 1.1 without the subject having to be registered directly in caTissue.
               • If subject is not already present in the service it shall be possible to register the appropriate records from within caTissue.
               • caTissue will update the appropriate services used by PSC to indicate specimens have been collected.

11 2.1.10   Structured Standard Operating Procedures

   caTissue currently records details of how specimens have been processed or handled as events. caTissue Suite 1.2 should introduce the  concept
   of a specimen processing protocol or standard operating procedure (SOP) which specifies processing steps. These protocols  may  be  associated
   with particular studies (collection protocols) such that all specimens on that study may be described as having been  processed  according  to
   the SOP.


   While the SOP defines the intended processing, the system shall also make provision for  quality  control  of  specimen  processing  to  allow
   tracking and recording of how specimens were actually processed.


   The system should also introduce the concept of a number (batch) of specimens being subjected to the same execution of an SOP  such  that  the
   parameters of that execution need only be recorded once.


   It shall be possible to query specimens according to their processing characteristics irrespective of whether that information is recorded  at
   a specimen or SOP level.

1 2.1.10.1  Integrate with Biospecimen Research Database (BRD)

   caTissue shall be able to retrieve SOPs from the Biospecimen Research Database via a common object model for Standard Operating Procedures.


   The subcontractor will work with the BRD development team to specify the interfaces between  these  two  systems,  to  coordinate  design  and
   development activities, and to develop a prototype to prove their design.


   To be more specific, the system shall implement the following use cases.
         • A caTissue user shall be able to query a list of SOPs from BRD that satisfy his/her specified criteria.
      • A caTissue user shall be able to query the structure data details for an SOP from BRD.
         • A caTissue user shall be able to import a SOP from BRD to caTissue and store that SOP in its own object model.
      • A caTissue user shall be able to create a brand new SOP in caTissue.
      • A caTissue user shall be able to expose the SOP as the grid service to share.

12 2.1.11   Implement the Common Biorepository Model (CBM)

   The subcontractor shall expand its object model to support CBM according to CBM specification such that caTissue shall pass all tests  of  CBM
   test suites. The CBM is defined here (reference).


   The current version of caTissue Suite contains a simple reporting mechanism which prototypes the concept of the Common Biorepository Model and
   supporting architecture.

13 2.1.12   API and grid service

   The appropriate public interfaces to new functionality introduced in caTissue Suite 1.2 shall be determined. These will be implemented as part
   of caTissue’s Application Programmers Interface (API) and as grid services.


   The caTissue API must continue to support the same validation of data that is applied to data entered via the user  interface.  The  API  must
   also require login by a registered user and authenticate it through caBIG security module.

4.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS

2 4.1 Development Methodology

This project will follow Rational Unified Process (RUP). Rational Unified Process is a  framework  which  is  adaptable  to  different  kinds  of
project. One of the key steps of the first phase of a RUP project is to determine the iteration  structure  required  and  the  appropriate  work
products to be produced. Responders to this RFP must describe the  planned  iteration  structure.  The  planned  work  products  should  also  be
described and should include those prescribed in this RFP.

See the following graph for conceptual RUP general phases and detailed process guidance.

                                                                      [pic]
                                                         Rational Unified Process Phases
Note: This graph is illustrative. The responders shall propose exact number of iterations in each phase as they see  fit.  See  instructions  for
submitters in Section L of the RFP.

The book Rational Unified Process Made Easy[6] may be used as a practical guide of applying RUP.

Developer and adopters will work together as a team to accomplish many tasks such as composing requirements, system use cases,  test  plan,  test
cases, and work together seamlessly during every iteration. For example, during testing period of each  iteration,  there  should  be  quick  and
smooth handover between developers and adaptors to ensure good quality product.

1 4.1.1     Core principles of RUP required.

While adaptation of the process is expected and an integral part of RUP it is key that the essence of RUP should be retained. In  particular  the
following principles should be retained.

Each iteration must result in executable software and a plan for evaluating that software. It is expected that earlier  iterations  will  produce
the architecture and components of the system rather than fully completed products for end users. Nevertheless, these  are  important  steps  and
those components should be implemented as executable software – not merely design artifacts. Early  iterations  which  produce  documentation  or
plans only will not be acceptable.

Risks should be identified and addressed early in the project.  The response to this solicitation should include an initial  risk  identification
of risks and a plan containing steps to address them.  Management of risk should be continued throughout the project.

Ensuring that customer feedback is obtained during each iteration.  Previous development cycles have included weekly  discussions  with  adopters
and one face to face meeting per iteration.

3 4.2 Supporting materials

The following documents are provided in an accompanying package as reference material
    • caTissue previous requirements
    • caTissue previous use cases
    • caTissue User’s guide
    • caTissue Deployment guides
    • caTissue Technical guides
    • caTissue design documents and object models
    • caTissue test management tool database dump

4 4.3 Knowledge Center

In order to support the tools developed in caBIG, the program funds  a  number  of  Knowledge  Centers  including  the  Biospecimen  Banking  and
Technology Tools Knowledge Center.

The developer will work with the Knowledge Center on a code and  build  architecture  which  allows  incorporation  of  features  or  refactoring
developed by the Knowledge Center or by any developer in the community. Any such incorporations suggested for  the  main  thread  of  development
initiated by this solicitation shall be at the discretion of  the caTissue Suite 1.2 developer and the SAIC-Frederick, Inc./NCI management team.


5. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

The Subcontractor shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of all tasks  performed  under  this  effort.  The
subcontractor shall work with adopters to gather requirements, compose use cases, design user  interfaces  and  review  all  artifacts  with  all
stakeholders. The subcontractor shall work with adopters to find and fix any defects quickly and effectively.

Note: The following activities are expected to be performed as part of the development of the system. The activities are not given in  particular
order. It is also expected that most activities will iterated over multiple phases/iterations in the RUP process. Respondents must specify  which
phases these activities belong to in their proposals.

Teleconferences shall be used for the majority of review meetings along with shared web sessions. The facilities for these will  be  provided  by
SAIC-Frederick and the NCI.

One face to face meeting should be planned per RUP iteration at which the executable software for that iteration will  be  introduced  to  users,
other stakeholders and external testers.

It is expected that all aspects of development shall be carried out in a thorough and systematic manner. Specific deliverables are  not  included
for their own sake but rather as key parts of an overall development methodology. For example, requirements documents  will  drive  test  scripts
and requirement will be cross referenced in those scripts, test scripts will be referenced in actual tests which will in turn  reference  defects
that arise during their execution. Many meetings will be structured around systematic stepping through of these items.

The following represent minimum task requirements.  The Offeror should propose additional tasks as  necessary  based  on  their  unique  research
plan.
1  Project Management
   1  Project Management Plan (PMP)
   The Subcontractor shall develop a Project Management Plan describing the means to accomplish project objectives. The PMP shall:
    • Include a work breakdown structure (WBS) encompassing activities and milestones for major tasks, time line and dependency of  these  tasks.
      Proposed deliverable due dates may be requested per the deliverable schedule in the Deliverables/Deliverables Schedule section below.
    • This draft WBS shall encompass any milestone reviews, as well as any requested contractor supplied dates for Deliverables.
    • Describe the technical approach, organizational resources and management controls employed to meet  the  cost,  performance,  and  schedule
      requirements for this effort.
    • Detail the products, methods for producing deliverables, allocation of staff and other resources necessary  to  produce  deliverables,  and
      timelines.
    • Specify high level dependencies among tasks and between caTissue 1.2 with other applications/tools/services.
    • Outline the risk management plan for the project.


   PMP’s shall include an MS Project formatted document including the WBS, and MS Word documents describing  any  other  plans  (e.g.  Management
   Approach, Risk).  An initial draft of the PMP shall be submitted with the proposal in project inception phase.


   The initial PMP in the proposal will be the base of a living project management document that is refined and changed as project move  forward.
   More details will be added and status will be changed as project moving from iteration to iterations. The  on-going  project  management  plan
   will be updated every week to reflect the progress and will be available for SAIC Contracting Officer’s  Technical  Representative  (COTR)  to
   review and monitor the progress. Based on review of the PMP, the COTR will provide  approval  to  move  forward  on  planned  activities.  The
   Subcontractor shall request prior approval for all activities not included in the PMP or any modifications to the plan after approval has been
   given. The final PMP, including any approved changes, shall be submitted as a deliverable at the end of the project.

    • Description of activities planned for the next month;
    • Description of resolution(s) to previously-identified issues/obstacles;
    • Delineation of risk factors that may delay completion of planned items and recommended solution(s);

   In addition, the Subcontractor shall participate in periodic status tele-conferences with the COTR at the direction and period as specified by
   the COTR.  Periodic tele-conferences will be held at no greater than weekly frequency, but focused tele-conferences to address specific issues
   may also be requested. The COTR can ask any project related questions by phone, email or in person at any frequency, the  subcontractor  shall
   response as soon as possible not exceed 24 hours. If an answer needs more than 24 hours preparation, the subcontractor shall inform  the  COTR
   by email within 24 hours with an estimated response time.

   8  Deployment Plan
   The Subcontractor shall create and update a detailed deployment plan for all planned products and services to be developed as described in the
   project management plan.  The deployment plan shall describe the technical environment on which the product (e.g. HW, OS, Middleware) is to be
   developed, the external dependencies, the procedures to be used for the development (e.g. lifecycle model, CM) and a detailed schedule for the
   deployment. (See appendix B for suggested tech stack.)


3  Development
The developer shall make all practical efforts to ensure that the system is deployable on a wide range of platforms that support  the  underlying
JEE, database and web browser architecture.    “Platform”  here  includes  client  and  server  operating  system,  database  management  system,
application server and versions of the above. Coding practices which require any specific particular platform version  should  be  avoided.  Code
reviews will take cognizance of this requirement.

The core technologies for caTissue Suite 1.2 are Java EE, SQL, HTML (version) and JavaScript (see Appendix B for the complete technical stack).

The API is a writeable caCORE like API.
The Grid Service is a caGrid data service or analytical service.

caTissue Suite 1.2 should not dependent on any commercial tool for operation and installation.

4  System Test
caTissue Suite is a complex application. Its current test suite includes approximately 1200 test scripts. Management of such  a  volume  requires
an appropriate test management tool to assist developers, testers, project managers and contract managers.

The subcontractor shall migrate the existing test case scripts and test results into the proposed test management tool.

   1  Develop System and Software Test Plan
   The subcontractor shall construct a detailed system and software test plan and test cases.


   The subcontractor shall propose processes, systems and tools that will provide requirement and use case traceability for each test case.


   The subcontractor shall reuse existing test scripts for caTissue Suite which are available at the test management tool database dump  included
   in the reference material. Test scripts shall be added to, modified or deleted  from  this  test  set  as  appropriate  to  the  features  and
   implementations added in caTissue Suite 1.2.


   The plan shall propose a test management system[7] to manage test plans, scripts and their linkage to requirements and/or use cases. It should
   also track the execution of tests on various software configurations and builds, recording the results of testing and link to  the  bug/defect
   reporting system. The tool shall allow project managers (including SAIC-Frederick, Inc./NCI) to view and generate different reports to monitor
   testing progress and anytime. These reports will allow the subcontractor and SAIC-Frederick, Inc. project management to:


   a) Determine that requirements are adequately covered by appropriate tests.
   b) The tests, and results thereof, that have been executed on any particular build.


   The plan shall cover unit testing, system/application testing, user acceptance testing, performance testing, load/stress test etc.


   The subcontractor shall propose user profile plan to describe the current and future user pattern and propose maximum concurrent users for the
   stress test. The capacity shall consider the user community growth pattern and plan the system to be able to handle the user growth  over  the
   next 5 years.


   2  Conduct System and Software Tests
   The subcontractor shall perform tests according to the test plan for the each process iteration.


   The results of all test executions must be logged to the test management system including test script run, software build, relevant server and
   client configuration. The results specified by the test script shall be recorded. In cases of test failure appropriate bug reports  should  be
   created.


   The subcontractor shall provide weekly report (daily report in last 3 weeks of the testing phase) to describe testing status such as how  many
   test cases have been covered, the percentage of the tested test cases compared to over all test cases, how many test cases to go to cover  all
   test cases.


   The subcontractor shall provide weekly report (daily report in last 3 weeks of each testing phase) to describe  how  many  defects  have  been
   found, how many defects have been addressed etc.


   The subcontractor shall provide a chart to describe the planned test schedule and the actual test schedule  so  we  can  see  whether  we  are
   proceed according to the plan.


   The applicability of automated testing is at the discretion of the developer and any planned usage should be described  in  response  to  this
   solicitation. It is expected that automated testing is particularly appropriate for unit, API and grid tests and that these may be run in each
   nightly build.


   The subcontractor shall prepare appropriate test data for relevant system and application tests e.g. performance tests, query tests, etc.

5  caBIG® ECCF  COMPLIANCE
caBIG® to date used a set of compatibility guidelines. Prior versions of caTissue were required to adhere to those guidelines and have  done  so.
The result has been formal certification of caTissue as silver compliant and a caGrid compatible application. Those guidelines are in process  of
review with the establishment of the caBIG® Enterprise Conformance and Compliance Framework (ECCF). As of this  writing  the  ECCF  is  still  in
draft form and open to comment. Therefore requirements as to conformance and compatibility are stated in  this  document  in  terms  of  required
interoperability with other systems.

caTissue shall make dynamic data extensions defined operationally visible and queryable via its grid interfaces. In  particular,  tools  such  as
caB2B or caIntegrator 2 which make use of semantic metadata exposed on caGrid should  be  able  to  query  data  defined  in   caTissue  (whether
statically or dynamically defined) in the same way as any grid application.

A Silver and Gold Compatibility Guidelines can be found on the caBIG Community Website at
https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/guidelines_documentation/?pid=primary.2006-07-07.4911641845&sid=compatability_certification&status=True
Specific criteria for Gold Compliance will be discussed at Project Kickoff.

   1  Generate Common Data Elements (CDEs)
   The Subcontractor shall generate CDEs for each of the approved UML models. All data structures that will be seen on the grid  shall  have  XML
   Metadata Interchange (XMI) representations, while purely internal classes and data structures will not undergo XMI or CDE  creation.  Approved
   UML models shall be used as the substrate for CDE creation. The Subcontractor shall use the Semantic Integration Workbench to annotate the UML
   Model and then follow the caBIG™ approved process to register the model in caDSR.
        1  Generate semantically annotated XMIs
        The Subcontractor must provide concept codes from publicly available vocabularies for descriptions of  objects  and  attributes  in  the
        model. The use of the SIW (Semantic  Integration  Workbench  is  encouraged,  but  not  strictly  necessary.   The  Subcontractor  shall
        iteratively revise annotations based on review by applicable CBIIT staff and VCDE Workspace members.

        1Artifact:  Complete, Semantically annotated XMI files (XMI 1.2 format)
        2  Generate CDEs in caDSR
        The Subcontractor shall submit the semantically annotated XMI files to NCI CBIIT for loading into caDSR and  creating  CDEs.  The  CDEs,
        created by loading the UML models into the caDSR, shall then be placed on the staging server of the  caDSR.  The  CDEs  on  the  staging
        server will be reviewed by the caDSR team and shall be iteratively refined by the Subcontractor. Once the UML models are loaded and  the
        refined CDEs are on the caDSR staging server, the development team shall submit an interoperability review package to the VCDE Workspace
        and request the CDEs to be moved to the production server of the caDSR.


      1Artifact:  Full CDE Use Report and Annotated XML Files
   2  Submit caBIG™  Compatibility Review Package
   The Subcontractor shall prepare a caBIG® Compatibility Review Package consisting of all artifacts for the determined project compliance  level
   as described in the Compatibility Guidelines, packaged together and submitted to the Cross-Cutting Workspaces for final review and approval of
   caBIG® compatibility.

   1Deliverable:  caBIG® Compatibility Review Submission Package (including all artifacts described above)

   Preliminary compliance artifacts will be presented at the Design review. An updated and more fully completed package will be presented at  the
   Deliverables Readiness Review.  The full submission package will be delivered at contract completion.
   3  Interoperability
   To ensure the goals of interoperability and compatibility are achieved the proposal should include plans to test caGrid services in caB2B  for
   end user queries and, for technical grid related purposes, the caGrid Portal.
6  System Deployment
   1  Deployment of iteration releases
   Testing shall not require the system to be installed locally by remote testers. The developer shall make available, for  each  iteration,  the
   web application at an internet accessible URL. Those components which require download (e.g. API client libraries, upgrade scripts) shall also
   be made available by the developer.
   2  Create Installation Package
   CBIIT has established the goal of making all caBIG and CBIIT software products and services easy to install and configure. It is critical that
   the developed software application and any corresponding Grid node implementations are packaged and documented in a manner suitable for use by
   the biomedical research community at large. This task will be to build, test, and demonstrate an installer package that requires only commonly
   found systems administration skills.
        1  Generate Installation Script
        The subcontractor shall create an installer that can install the whole application from a binary distribution.  The  installation  steps
        shall provide intuitive instruction to what parameters shall be specified for optional values when there no value entered by users,  the
        default value shall be used.  These parameters should be savable to an appropriate configuration file[8].


        The installation script shall be a tested component of the system with appropriate test scipts and execution thereof.
        2  Upgrade paths
        An upgrade mechanism must be provided such that existing caTissue Suite 1.1.x installations may be upgraded to caTissue Suite 1.2.


        Upgrades must maintain the integrity of data in any instance of caTissue being upgraded. This must include dynamic extensions,  security
        data in addition to the data directly perceived by end users.


        The upgrade mechanism must be tested. Appropriate test scripts and test results for the upgrade mechanism must be provided.

        Local customizations made by individual user sites via the existing documented (see technical guide included in the  reference  package)
        extension points in caTissue (printer integration, label generation, etc.) must continue to function. If it is deemed necessary to  make
        changes to any of these extension points appropriate instructions must be  provided  to  sites  as  to  how  to  modify  their  existing
        customizations to the new standard. Changes to the API specifications shall be documented in  a  fashion  that  allows  those  who  have
        written tools which use the APIs to make appropriate modifications.


        It shall not be required to support custom code development made by installation sites by means  other  than  the  documented  extension
        points and APIs.


        It shall not be required that the upgrade scripts accommodate data issues arising from situations where installing  sites  have  entered
        data to the system by means other than the released caTissue web interface or via its API. For  example,  upgrade  issues  arising  from
        direct loading by sites into the underlying database schema will be out of scope.
   3  Develop Installation Guide
   The Subcontractor shall develop an Installation Guide and prepare Release Notes for the installation of  the  application  and  its  services.
   Release Notes shall document known bugs and their status, and provide references/links to other relevant documentation. The Installation Guide
   shall outline the supported configurations and technical installation instructions for the services.
7  Software Product Documentation
The Subcontractor shall prepare the following documentation for various kinds of users of the system. Together these documents are the  reference
material for the system that has been developed. These documents may include material from the  development  documentation  but  should  be  self
sufficient and not require reference to that documentation.


|User documentation                        |Target group                                                                       |
|Deployment Guide                          |System administrators                                                              |
|User Manual                               |Biorepository staff, researchers requiring biospecimens                            |
|Application Developers Guide/API document |Systems administrators and integrators.                                            |
|Application Administration Guide          |Systems administrators                                                             |

The    Subcontractor    may    follow    the    guidelines    specified    in    caBIG™    Documentation    and    Training    Review    Process;
(https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/working_groups/Training_SLWG/Documents/).
8  Release readyness Review
The Subcontractor shall work with all stakeholders to review all final artifacts and  testing  status.  A  decision  will  be  made  whether  the
software is ready to be released and go the next phase. When the system is ready to be deployed, the  subcontractor  shall  prepare  the  release
candidate[9] , test it and submit it to the COTR and for approval. If the release is rejected, the subcontractor shall  address  the  issues  and
prepare a further release candidate and repeat the process.[10]
9  Maintain the system for 2 months
The subcontractor shall maintain the system for 2 months after the system was deployed to production to work with end users on usability  of  the
system and fix any priority 1 and priority 2 defects come out of the exercise.

Priority 1 defect is defined as the affected functionality is critical to business. User’s ability to utilize  affected  feature  is  totally  or
almost totally affected.

Priority 2 defect is defined as a problem affects areas of functionality but users have a workaround which alleviate the impact to the user.

Priority 3 defect is defined as minor and cosmetic. Problems do not impact use of the product in any substantive way.

3     6.2.3 Specific Deliverable Acceptance Criteria

Specific Acceptance Criteria
The following specific criteria will be used when evaluating deliverables listed above.

(Deliverable: Project Management Plan
Acceptance Criteria: The project management plan shall include the following;
 • Project Schedule; The Project schedule shall be delivered in MS Project format.  It shall include a hierarchical set of tasks representing the
   Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) required for the contractor to successfully  complete  the  tasks  given  in  this  statement  of  work.   Task
   dependencies, task dates, resource loading, and updated milestones and deliverable dates shall all be included.  The project  management  plan
   should also include tasks which address the anticipated risks and which baseline architecture according to RUP principles.

 • Management Approach; The Management Approach shall be an MS Word formatted document  describe  the  organizational  resources  and  management
   controls employed to meet the cost, performance, and schedule requirements as  outlined  in  the  project  schedule.  This  shall  detail  the
   products, methods for producing deliverables, allocation of staff and other resources necessary to produce deliverables,  and  timelines,  and
   any Government Furnished Information/Equipment expected from the Government (GFE/I).

Acceptable Project Management Plans will include the above information, in the formats  requested,  in  sufficient  detail  to  cover  all  tasks
requested in this RFP.

(Deliverable: Monthly Status Report
Acceptance Criteria: The monthly status report shall be delivered in  the  template  supplied  by  the  COTR  with  all  fields  completed.   Any
exceptions must be approved by the COTR.  It shall be sent via email directly to the SAIC-COTR  and  Contracts  Specialist.   Acceptable  Monthly
Status reports will contain the complete set of requested information in the format requested.

(Deliverable: Project Summary Report
Acceptance Criteria: The Project Summary Report shall be delivered in Microsoft Word format and shall  describe  the  work  accomplished  against
each task in this Statement of Work and its success in meeting the goals and objectives of the project. All products produced by this work  shall
be described.  Any issues encountered, resolutions, and lessons learned shall also be given.  For any project  deploying  Grid  Services,  either
Analytical or Data, a sustainment plan for these services should be included. Acceptable Project Summary Reports will include all  of  the  above
information, in sufficient detail so that a reader familiar with this RFP will be able to judge progress against all tasks in  the  Statement  of
Work contained herein.

(Deliverable: System and Software Design and Implementation Plan
Acceptance Criteria: The System Design and Deployment Plan shall include at a minimum, the following:

System Use Cases; Use cases should be expressed in textual format according to UML standards.  Use case diagrams are a useful adjunct but  convry
insufficient information in themselves.  Use cases shall detail actors, actions initiated by those, pre-and post conditions of the use case,  and
branches.  Acceptable use case deliverables will include a set of use cases containing this information, which as a whole  provide  coverage  for
all of the capability requested in this RFP, and which clearly depict the intended users  and  use  of  the  fully  developed,  deployed  system.
Contractor derived Use Cases must be consistent with any provided Enterprise-wide Use Cases.

System and Software Design; Design documentation shall contain at a minimum design artifacts describing both the architecture and design  of  the
products to be developed.  These can be presented in the design framework of the subcontractor’s choice, although UML is  preferred.   Acceptable
design documents will include  at  least  the  following;  assumptions  and  dependencies,  general  constraints,  architectural  strategies  and
development methods, system and subsystem architecture, detailed system and subsystem design - both static and dynamic.  These must be  presented
in sufficient breadth and detail to cover the complete set of requirements as outlined in this Statement of Work.

Preliminary Compatibility Review Package; For projects developing compliant products, a draft Compatibility package with items 1-4 of the  silver
submission package (as described above) must be included.

Deployment Plan; An acceptable Deployment plan shall describe, at a minimum,  the technical environment within which the product  (e.g.  HW,  OS,
Middleware) is to be developed, the external dependencies, the teams and locations that will perform the development, the procedures to  be  used
for the development (e.g. lifecycle model, CM) and a detailed schedule.

(Deliverable: System and Software Test Plan, Scripts and Execution
Acceptance Criteria: The System and Software test plan shall  demonstrate  comprehensive  coverage  of  functionality  and  supported  deployment
configurations.  Describe at a minimum, what is to be tested and what are the criteria for passing each test, the strategy  to  be  employed  for
each test, the testing environment (Hardware/Software to be employed), and the testing schedule.  Acceptable System and Software Test plans  will
be those that provide complete test coverage both from a user perspective, i.e. can be traced to all steps of the delivered use cases,  and  from
a functional perspective, i.e. that can be traced to all requirements and newly developed features  and  functions  implied  by  the  system  and
software detailed design.

Each test script shall be linked to a requirement and use case, which link back to the most update requirement and use  case  description.   Test
scripts shall be written such that they can be run by anyone who has gained a  basic  understanding  of  the  application.  Think  of  situations
whereby an organization might want to perform tests in certain scenarios. The test scripts should be  written  in  such  a  way  that  they  have
sufficient information to do so.
For example:

A site decides they want to use a new web browser and run all relevant tests to determine if caTissue functions correctly on that browser.

A site makes local customizations of caTissue and wishes to perform regression testing of existing functionality.

The test suite should be available in a manner that these sites can identify the appropriate tests and run them independently.

Test scripts and executions shall be managed in the test management system – including those written by third parties such  as  adopters  or  NCI
CBIIT’s QA group.

(Deliverable: Test Results
Acceptance Criteria: Test execution and results shall be documented in the test management system proposed by the  developer  and  agreed  during
the ensuing contract.  Test executions should record the identity of the tester, date run and details of system (server  and  client)  build  and
configuration.  Results identified by the test scripts should be recorded along with  an  overall  pass/fail  designation.   Software  defect/bug
reports arising from a failed script execution should be referenced.

For a particular build or iteration, it must be possible to easily see the actual tests run and the results for all test cases described  in  the
System and Software Test Plan.  The documentation of the test procedures must be given in sufficient detail so that the  COTR  will  be  able  to
determine whether the test provided adequate coverage of the feature, function or change being tested.

There should be a testing dashboard that allows stakeholders to see most update status at any time and generate ad hoc reports.

The test results will not be accepted until evidence has been given that all tests in the test plan  have  successfully  been  executed  and  all
tests have passed, unless exceptions are specifically allowed by the COTR.  The COTR may request a visual demonstration  of  tests  specified  in
the Test Plan as part of final acceptance.

All Java code shall follow java code convention and all major methods shall have unit test code.

Appropriate unit tests, API and grid tests shall be automated and executed automatically in each integration, QA and nightly build.

(Deliverable: Software Code and Software Documentation
Acceptance Criteria: This deliverable is comprised of both the Software Code and Documentation
Software Code acceptance is contingent on the following:
    • Test results acceptance
    • Evidence by inspection that all source code has been placed in the public open source code management system.
    • Java code shall conform to basic Java coding conventions and to the architectures determined during design reviews.
    • Adequate commenting of source code (adequate will mean that at a minimum, each function point of the code has at least one comment)
    • Build Documentation
    • Demonstration that software retrieved from  the  delivered  code  base  can  be  successfully  built  and  generates  the  proposed  binary
      distribution.
      Software documentation is contingent on the following;
    • Software Code acceptance
    • The documentation is complete from the perspective of the intended user, i.e. that it addresses all major end-user functions as defined  by
      the system use cases, and application development areas as defined in the detailed and API design documentation.

(Deliverable: Compatibility Review Submission Package
   Acceptance Criteria: Acceptable Compatibility Review Submission Package will be those that meet the  caBIG  Compatibility  Guidelines.   These
   can be found on the caBIG Community Website at;
https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/guidelines_documentation/?pid=primary.2006-07-07.4911641845&sid=compatability_certification&status=True

(Deliverable: Deployment Package
Acceptance Criteria: This deliverable will consist of the Application Installer, Installation Guide and Release Notes, and  Product  and/or  Grid
Services Demonstration.  The application Installer and Installation Guide and Release notes shall be accepted upon successful  use  of  these  by
the COTR or his or designated representative to install the application within the following parameters;

    • Installation Environment(s); OS, Specified Tech Stack, etc
    • Time to Install: < XX minutes
    • Installation Guide is not missing Installation Steps
    • Etc.

Installation guide acceptance is contingent upon completeness of the guide, i.e. that no missing steps  are  discovered  in  the  course  of  the
installation test.  Release Notes must contain a complete set of user related issues as checked against the  developer’s  internal  bug  tracking
system.

Accepted Product Demonstrations will be those that demonstrate all newly developed end-user features  without  issues.   Grid  services  will  be
checked by the COTR at an unannounced time after subcontractor notification that the grid service is live.  Grid Services will be  accepted  that

[7] Note: A test management system is not a test automation system though may interact with one.
[8] caTissue Core 1.0 through caTissue Suite 1.1 have used one or more properties files for this purpose.
[9] Release Candidate is a designation for any build of the software which it is believed to be ready for release. Release candidates may only
builds which contain all the software features for release. Release candidates are not produced during pre-transition iterations.
[10] For reference, both caTissue Suite 1.0 and 1.1 took three release candidates to reach suitable quality.
