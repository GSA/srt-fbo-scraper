| The GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and         procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements         associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to         be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by         solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their         proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements. The         GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables         reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the         six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the         requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the         Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables         correspond to accessibility information about information content         deliverables and labor hours, respectively. |

Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in         the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are         identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not         identified with program requirements for this acquisition have no entry in         the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has         physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed         EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program         requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide         appropriate accessibility information. |

| The activity to be performed relates to or         requires the use of EIT. Section 508 must be considered as a requirement         for the EIT related labor hours activity to assure that it considers         specific Section 508 accessibility requirements. The specific requirements         that apply depend upon the specific type of EIT related to performing the         activity as well as the functional performance criteria detailed in         1194.31 |            |                      FullyPartiallyNoDon't know |                |
