____________________________________________________________________________________ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

DOLJ099629625 ­ ATTACHMENT 03 ­ WAGE DETERMINATION 05-2103 (REV 8)

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

D-6

DOL089RP20605 1. Background Investigations

Section D

As a requirement of HSPD-12, all eligible employees MUST be fingerprinted and results successfully adjudicated by the Department of Labor. Additionally, a background investigation, based on position risk, must be initiated. No employee is allowed to begin work at DOL, if the above criteria are not met. a. Background Investigation Requirements. The investigation requirements for contractor employees are based on the risk or sensitivity level designation of the position. The Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, or other DOL Agency's designated official informs the Contractor of the risk or sensitivity level for each contractor employee position. The minimum level of investigation for each risk or sensitivity level is indicated below. Position Risk/Sensitivity Level: Minimum Investigation Requirement:      Low Risk/Non-sensitiveModerate Risk High Risk Noncritical-Sensitive Critical-Sensitive National Agency Check & Inquiries (NACI) Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) Background Investigation (BI) Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)* Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI)*

* Individuals occupying Critical-Sensitive positions (i.e., require Top Secret security clearances) are subject to reinvestigation every 5 years. Individuals occupying Noncritical-Sensitive positions are subject to reinvestigation every 10 years for Secret security clearances and every 15 years for confidential security clearances. b. Conducting Background Investigations. All contract employees require a background investigation. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will conduct background investigations for DOL employees and contractor employees. Since OPM only accepts requests from Federal agencies to conduct background investigations, the DOL Agency will make arrangements with the Contractor to send the contractor employee's completed papers to the DOL Agency for submission to OPM. c. Payment for Background Investigation. If the DOL Agency bears the cost for background investigations on contractor employees, the designated DOL Agency official will forward the required documents to OPM. If the Contractor bears the cost of the investigations, that cost is not reimbursable. 2. The Investigation Process If the Contractor chooses to complete employee investigations, consistent with the requirements of HSPD-12 and the Department of Labor's Personal Identity Verification (PIV) process, the Contractor shall submit written procedures to the designated DOL Agency official describing the method by which the following investigation requirements will be satisfied. a. Pre-employment Checks. Before a contractor employee can begin work for DOL, he or she must provide the Contractor with a properly completed OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, on which the employee has completed items 1 through 7c, questions 9 through 13, and item 16 as necessary, and has signed item 17. (Attachment is a copy of the OF-306. This form can also be found at the following website: http://www.opm.gov/forms.) If the Contractor has not received a completed OF-306 from the contractor employee within 5 days after requesting the form, the Contractor shall notify. If the person answers "Yes" to one or more of questions 9 through 13, the Contractor shall notify immediately. The designated DOL Agency official will inform the Contractor whether or not the contractor employee may work on the contract. Before making this decision the designated DOL Agency official may also require a pre-employment FBI fingerprint check on contract employees. This procedure is described in Chapter 2, Section 6.

b. Submission of Investigation Documents. The Contractor shall submit the required documents below to the designated DOL Agency official within 14 calendar days of each contractor employee's placement on the contract in a High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, or Noncritical-Sensitive position. However, the Single Scope Background Investigation must be completed before the contractor employee is placed in a Critical-Sensitive position, unless the Department approves the placement of the contractor employee's placement in the position before the investigation is completed. The specific form that he or she completes depends on the risk or sensitivity level of the work that he or she will perform. These forms can be found on the following website: http://www.opm.gov/forms.   The SF-85, Questionnaire for Non-sensitive Positions, is used with positions or work that is designated at the Low Risk level. The minimum investigation required is a National Agency Check and Inquiries. The SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, is used with positions or work that is designated at the Moderate or High Risk level. The minimum investigation required for the Moderate Risk level is a Minimum Background Investigation. The minimum investigation required for the High Risk level is a Background Investigation. The SF-86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, is used with positions or work that is designated at the Noncritical-Sensitive or Critical-Sensitive level. The minimum investigation for Noncritical-Sensitive work is a Minimum Background Investigation. The minimum investigation for Critical-Sensitive work is a Single Scope Background Investigation.

However, the Contractor shall submit the fingerprints of the contractor employee to on a Form FD-258. 3. Adjudication a. Referral of Suitability Issues. When OPM has completed the contractor employee's background investigation, it shall send the report of investigation to the Department's Office of Executive Resources and Personnel Security (OERPS). If the report contains suitability issues, the OERPS will forward the report to the designated DOL Agency official for review and adjudication. b. Suitability Standard and Criteria. The suitability standard and criteria are described in Chapter 3, Section 3. c. Unfavorable Suitability Determination. If the designated DOL Agency official determines that the contractor employee is unsuitable, the Contracting Officer or designee will inform the Contractor in writing that the contractor employee is denied access to DOL facilities and/or information and information systems. If revoking access to DOL facilities and/or information and information systems negatively impacts the contractor employee's ability to perform, he or she shall be removed from the contract. Any removal of a contractor employee shall not be considered grounds for a delay or adjustment claim from the Contractor. D-8

Rating Adjective Excellent

Good

Satisfactory

Marginal

Section E Unsatisfactory Fails to meet performance or capability standards. Requirements can only be met with major changes to the proposal.

For each element described in the Technical Capability under: Technical Approach, Prior Experience, and Key Personnel, proposal responses will be evaluated and each element assigned a standard of either: Strength; Meets; Weakness; Significant Weakness or Deficiency. See table below that describes each standard. Standard Definitions Definition A strong attribute of particular worth or utility; an inherent asset. Simple adherence to the requirements or ability to meet a requirement. A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.

Standard Strength Meets the Requirement Weakness Significant Weakness Deficiency

Evaluating Past Performance Each Past Performance questionnaire received will be scored as described in the questionnaire. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's past performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation, in terms of scope, size and magnitude.  The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and government personal knowledge of offeror's past performance, to assess past performance. Offeror shall provide a list of no more than three (3) of the most relevant contracts performed for the Federal government within the last 3 years. The evaluation of past performance information may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, offeror shall provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of three past and present relevant contracts. The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the CO reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. The Government intends to evaluate the proposals and award a contract, without discussions with the offerors, unless discussions are determined to be necessary. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. E-2









Section E (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Evaluating Price Each Business/Price proposal is evaluated and a price reasonableness analysis is performed. Price reasonableness may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.

E.3. ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 Basis For Contract Award
I. Offerors' proposals will be evaluated in the three areas, as follows:    Technical Capability Past Performance; and Price.

1. Technical Capability The Technical Proposal addresses the Offeror's understanding of the SOW and how the proposal meets the requirements of the SOW. The technical proposal also describes the offeror's proposed approach to address the SOW for the eight (8) tasks defined in Sub-Factor 1-1; the offeror's prior experience relevant to the eighteen (18) questions in Sub-Factor 1-2; and how the candidates proposed for the eight (8) key personnel positions meet all criteria in Sub-Factor 1-3. The offeror shall adhere to the requirements of the SOW. 2. Past Performance Past Performance addresses the Government's level of confidence in the probability of the offeror successfully performing the effort, as proposed, based on the offeror's record of performance in past relevant contract efforts. The Past Performance evaluation will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an offeror's relevant present and recent past performance based on all information available to the Contracting Officer. 3. Business / Price Proposal The Business / Price Proposal shall address a total firm-fixed price for this effort. The business proposal should identify and price all labor categories supporting each of the eight tasks in the SOW and include all rates, estimated hours, and summarized for each of the five CLINS, in Section B1 ­ Price/Cost Schedule. II. Evaluation Criteria Based on the technical evaluation criteria and price, award will be made to the offeror representing the best value to the Government. Technical and Past Performance evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price, but as proposals become more equal technically, the price may become a determining factor in award selection. The approach to award for this procurement will be pursuant to the best value concept, which is to select the proposal that offers the best value for the Government. Proposals will be evaluated using the following evaluation factors, which must be addressed by all Offerors.

E-3

Information Technology has become a critical enabling resource for providing high quality services to citizens by competent knowledge workers. Demands for technology services continue to increase, as the Department of Labor (DOL) strives to meet its internal strategic goals that allow success in reaching the President's Management Agenda (PMA). Four essential goals of the DOL Strategic Plan must be met in order to empower America's workers: 1. A Prepared Workforce ­ Develop a prepared workforce by providing effective training and support services to new and incumbent workers and supplying high-quality information on the economy and labor market. 2. A Competitive Workforce ­ Meet the competitive labor demands of the worldwide economy by enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the workforce development and regulatory systems that assist workers and employers in meeting the challenges of global competition. 3. Safe and Secure Workplaces ­ Promote workplaces that are safe, healthful, and fair; guarantee workers receive the wages due them; foster equal opportunity in employment; and protect veterans' employment and reemployment rights. 4. Strengthened Economic Protections - Protect and strengthen worker economic security through effective and efficient provision of unemployment insurance and workers' compensation; ensuring union transparency; and securing pension and health benefits. Trends continue to show that the demands for technology savvy workers will grow. The Department through its IT Governance Framework processes which encompasses; Capital Planning and Investment Control and the Federal Enterprise Architecture Programs that have resulted in well organized processes to select, evaluate, and control technology programs that drive the business. ITC must retool its management processes to attain the level of performance to meet these goals. Five main Information Technology Service Management goals for this Statement of Work (SOW) were established:

STATEMENT OF WORK

II. Integrated process, project and investment management III. Efficient customer service, customer tracking, and response procedures IV. Effective team communications, collaboration, and reporting V. Integrating business investment and IT services Excerpts from the President's report on progress made in attaining the goals set forth in the President's Management Agenda highlight the importance of this strategic change in the management approach to IT services and processes within ITC. The urgency that lies ahead is captured in the following excerpt from the last report on PMA performance: The achievements reported established a threshold for success that must be continually met, but also must be surpassed. As the future is embraced, and concrete actions are taken, it is the quality of decisions made today that will produce the anticipated value that is reported below in the PMA report. To be successful in attaining these goals, OSDI has two major areas of operational responsibility; IT Governance and Business and Solutions Development and Support) that fulfill:

1.3.1

IT Governance:

4.1

Scope of Work
Objective

For both core areas of operational responsibility in the OSDI program, the vendor will be required to develop and apply approved performance measurement standards with metrics, including earned value management. Software metrics are a centerpiece of ensuring that resources are correctly aligned with the ITC business processes. OMB requires projects to remain within 10 percent of overrun thresholds. As such, if ITC and OSDI cannot properly measure performance and use the data to improve future work estimates. Today's data becomes tomorrow's historical data for reference and decision making. The vendor shall integrate their time management process with the ITC project resource management environment, so that resources and effort are aligned with an actual approved project in OSDI or ITC, if such resource support requires work beyond OSDI. The process will answer some of the following questions: How much is the software maintenance program costing over reporting periods determined by the government? What fraction of maintenance is attributed to specific systems? How much is spent on adaptive, perfective, and corrective maintenance? To answer these questions, particularly the last, ITC will require recording and tracking in an environment that can be integrated with the ITC project and resource management systems, the hours spent on each of the three activity types above. The vendor shall ensure that systems and reports aligned with this scope do not create a monopoly position, if and when contract re-compete occurs. The results will allow government management to set periodic performance standards for quality and efficiency, such as reduction of corrective costs, ergo a reduction in product defects. The vendor's proposal shall describe how past experience prepares them for this responsibility and how it's been applied in other engagements. Product development shall comprise software and business development activities. Both shall use the DOL SDLCM and DOL IT Project Management practices as foundations for realizing high-quality deliverables. The timeframe covered by this scope will be one base and four option years from contract award. Consulting services for this contract will be requested by task order, to be billed and paid by the Department of Labor. The vendor shall provide Information Technology consulting services to OSDI according to the tasks issued against the awarded contract. Services will span the following IT Project Management process areas: Concept, Planning, Execution, Control, and Closeout. Tasks will include strategic business planning, enterprise architecture development and management, investment portfolio management, custom software development, project management, and other services consistent with the ITIL Services framework.
