solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that
--

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(1) Listed End Product

(2) Certification.  (If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then
the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.)

(  )(i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in
the corresponding country as listed for that product.

(  ) (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the

the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for
the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));

(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for
these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

(1) Goals, expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars, for the use of small business, veteran-owned small
business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business

disadvantaged, and women-owned small business trade associations). A firm may rely on the information contained in CCR as an accurate
representation of a concern's size and ownership characteristics for the purposes of maintaining a small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled
veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business source list. Use of CCR as its source list does not
relieve a firm of its responsibilities (e.g., outreach, assistance, counseling, or publicizing subcontracting opportunities) in this clause.

used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be incurred with --

following functions:

(1) Assist small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small
disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities,
specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate the participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor’s lists of potential small
business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and
women-owned small business subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business concerns an
opportunity to compete over a period of time.

(2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-
owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in all “make-or-buy”
decisions.

(3) Counsel and discuss subcontracting opportunities with representatives of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled
veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business firms.

(4) Confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a HUBZone small business concern is identified as a certified HUBZone small business
concern by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database or by contacting SBA.

(5) Provide notice to subcontractors concerning penalties and remedies for misrepresentations of business status as small, veteran-owned small
business, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged or women-owned small business for the purpose of obtaining a subcontract that is to be included as
part or all of a goal contained in the Contractor’s subcontracting plan.

(f) A master plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements required by paragraph (d) of this clause, except goals, may
be incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of the offeror by this clause; provided --

(1) The master plan has been approved;

(2) The offeror ensures that the master plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved master plan, including evidence of its
approval, to the Contracting Officer; and

(3) Goals and any deviations from the master plan deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are
set forth in the individual subcontracting plan.

(g) A commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. The commercial plan shall relate
to the offeror's planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and Government business, rather than solely to the Government contract.
Once the Contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government will not require another subcontracting plan from the same Contractor
while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the Contractor continues to meet the definition of a
commercial item. A Contractor with a commercial plan shall comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (d)(10) of this clause by
submitting one SSR in eSRS for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report shall be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the
Contracting Officer who approved the plan. This report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government's fiscal year.

(h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer
in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.

associated with the modification or option shall be added to those in the existing subcontract plan.

(j) Subcontracting plans are not required from subcontractors when the prime contract contains the clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and
Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, or when the subcontractor provides a commercial item subject to
the clause at 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Items, under a prime contract.

(k) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with --

(1) The clause of this contract entitled “Utilization Of Small Business Concerns;” or

(2) An approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract.

(l) The Contractor shall submit ISRs and SSRs using the web-based eSRS at http://www.esrs.gov. Purchases from a corporation, company, or
subdivision that is an affiliate of the prime Contractor or subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract award data reported by
prime Contractors and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for
awards made to lower tier subcontractors, unless the Contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small
disadvantaged business credit from an ANC or Indian tribe.

(1) ISR. This report is not required for commercial plans. The report is required for each contract containing an individual subcontract plan
and shall be submitted to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or Contracting Officer, if no ACO is assigned.

(i) The report shall be submitted semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ending March 31 and September 30. A report is also
required for each contract within 30 days of contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless
otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity
since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period.

(ii) When a subcontracting plan contains separate goals for the basic contract and each option, as prescribed by FAR 19.704(c), the dollar goal
inserted on this report shall be the sum of the base period through the current option; for example, for a report submitted after the second
option is exercised, the dollar goal would be the sum of the goals for the basic contract, the first option, and the second option.

(iii) The authority to acknowledge receipt or reject the ISR resides--

(A) In the case of the prime Contractor, with the Contracting Officer; and

(B) In the case of a subcontract with a subcontracting plan, with the entity that awarded the subcontract.

(2) SSR.

(i) Reports submitted under individual contract plans--

(A) This report encompasses all subcontracting under prime contracts and subcontracts with the awarding agency, regardless of the dollar value
of the subcontracts.

(B) The report may be submitted on a corporate, company or subdivision (e.g. plant or division operating as a separate profit center) basis,
unless otherwise directed by the agency.

(C) If a prime Contractor and/or subcontractor is performing work for more than one executive agency, a separate report shall be submitted to
each executive agency covering only that agency's contracts, provided at least one of that agency's contracts is over $550,000 (over $1,000,000
for construction of a public facility) and contains a subcontracting plan. For DoD, a consolidated report shall be submitted for all contracts
awarded by military departments/agencies and/or subcontracts awarded by DoD prime Contractors. However, for construction and related maintenance
and repair, a separate report shall be submitted for each DoD component.

(D) For DoD and NASA, the report shall be submitted semi-annually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30.
For civilian agencies, except NASA, it shall be submitted annually for the twelve month period ending September 30. Reports are due 30 days
after the close of each reporting period.

(E) Subcontract awards that are related to work for more than one executive agency shall be appropriately allocated.

(F) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs in eSRS, including SSRs submitted by subcontractors with subcontracting plans, resides with the
Government agency awarding the prime contracts.

(ii) Reports submitted under a commercial plan--

(A) The report shall include all subcontract awards under the commercial plan in effect during the Government's fiscal year.

(B) The report shall be submitted annually, within thirty days after the end of the Government's fiscal year.

(C) If a Contractor has a commercial plan and is performing work for more than one executive agency, the Contractor shall specify the percentage
of dollars attributable to each agency from which contracts for commercial items were received.

(D) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs for commercial plans resides with the Contracting Officer who approved the commercial plan.

(iii) All reports submitted at the close of each fiscal year (both individual and commercial plans) shall include a Year-End Supplementary
Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses. The report shall include subcontract awards, in whole dollars, to small disadvantaged business
concerns by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector. If the data are not available when the year-end SSR is
submitted, the prime Contractor and/or subcontractor shall submit the Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses within 90
days of submitting the year-end SSR. For a commercial plan, the Contractor may obtain from each of its subcontractors a predominant NAICS
Industry Subsector and report all awards to that subcontractor under its predominant NAICS Industry Subsector.

M.2.1.4.  Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify any aspect of their proposal or to resolve minor or clerical errors.

M.3.  BASIS FOR AWARD

M.3.1.  The Government intends to conduct the acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12.

M.3.2. The Government will select the offer representing the best value to the Government based upon an assessment of (1) Technical Capability,
(2) Past Performance, and (3) Cost/Price.  Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition, in the Government’s estimation, provides the
greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement (FAR Section 2.101).

M.3.3.   For a proposal to be eligible for award the offeror must either demonstrate a relevant and recent past performance record that provides
confidence in the offeror’s ability to successfully perform as proposed or achieve a Neutral rating; meet all technical requirements of the
solicitation; and conform to all required terms and conditions at a reasonable price.

M.3.4.  An evaluation will be made of each offeror’s proposal.  Throughout the evaluation, the Government will consider “corrective potential”
when a deficiency, weakness, or proposal inadequacy is identified.  Proposals unrealistic in terms of Technical Capability, cost/price, or
schedule commitments will be deemed indicative of an inherent lack of comprehension of the complexity and risks of the requirements and may be
rejected.  While the Government evaluation teams and the Contracting Officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process,
by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.

M.3.5. The successful offeror shall be actively registered in the CCR Database in order to be eligible for award.  Registration shall be
accomplished via http://www.ccr.gov/.

M.3.6. The order award decisions will be based on the Government’s evaluation of each Offeror’s complete proposal against the evaluation
criteria identified in Addendum M.4, below.

M.4. Evaluation Criteria.


M.4.1. The Evaluation Criteria the Government will consider in evaluating the offeror’s capabilities and the proposals submitted in response to
the solicitation.  The Evaluation Criteria are intended to show the scope of the evaluation to be performed on proposals submitted in response
to the Request for Quote (RFQ).  Information gathered from the evaluation will be provided to the source selection authority for use in making a
source selection decision in accordance with the paragraphs below.  Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information, in the format
specified in the Instructions to Offerors, to enable the evaluator(s) to fully ascertain each offeror’s capability to perform all the
requirements contemplated by this solicitation.   Offerors may be asked, at the discretion of the Government, to provide additional information
for clarification.


M.5. Proposal Evaluation Process.

M.5.1. Written Proposals. Offerors shall submit written proposals in an electronic format.   The Technical Capability, Past Performance, and
Cost/Price factors shall be discussed in separate Parts.   The information contained in the written proposals will be used to evaluate specific
factors/subfactors identified below.  The past performance Part will contain points of contact for a up to 3 recent, relevant contracts.
Telephone or email questionnaires will be used to gather customer input to assess the past performance factor.  The Past Performance information
shall be within the last three years from the date of the solicitation release, of having requirements similar in scope to the requirements of
this solicitation.


M.5.2.   Determination of the Competitive Range.  A competitive range determination may be made based on the evaluation of the written proposals
submitted electronically.  If made, it will include the most highly rated proposals, unless further reduced for the purposes of economy and
efficiency.

M.6.  Factors and Sub factors.

M.6.1. General.  The Government will apply evaluation criteria to identify the best value proposal.  The evaluation criteria represent key areas
of importance to be considered in the source selection decision.  The factors and sub factors have been chosen to support a meaningful
discrimination between and among competing proposals.


M.6.2. Relative Importance.  The Technical/Management Approach Factor is more important than Past Performance, and when combined
Technical/Management and Past Performance, are significantly more important than Cost/Price.  The Technical/Management sub factors are listed in
descending order of importance.  Cost/price proposals will not be rated or scored, but will be evaluated based upon the Discounted Life Cycle
Cost (DLCC).

M.6.3. Factor 1 - Technical Management Approach Factor.
 Specify importance:  Most Important Evaluation Factor with sub-factors being equal.

            Sub factor 1:  Demonstrated ability to  provide  COTS  software  for  purchase  (not  licensed/leased)  that  does  not  require  the
installation or download of software for individual desktops and that meets the requirements of the PWS.

            Sub factor 2:  Demonstrated ability to provide user guidance and training necessary to ensure effective DOD implementation of CMTS.


                         Sub factor 3:  Demonstrated ability to provide a solution that meets the functional requirements of the PRD.

                         Sub factor 4:  Demonstrated ability to meet the security requirements of the PWS.

                 Sub factor 5:  Demonstrated ability to provide a solution that utilizes an Oracle database.

 In addition to other proposal risk issues as described in Section M.8 below, the technical/management evaluation will include an assessment of
 the risk associated with any necessary software changes or development necessary to meet the solicitation requirements.




M.6.4. Factor 2 - Past Performance Factor. Past Performance is less important than Technical/Management


              (1) Past Performance information shall include either commercial or government contracts performed within three (3) years prior to
the date of release of the solicitation, and having requirements/objectives similar in size and scope to the requirements of the PRD and
performance work statement.   The past performance may be the prime vendor’s efforts and/or the teaming/subcontracting efforts.  No more than
two task orders can be from the same contract.  The offeror and its subcontractors shall each provide no more than three (3) past performance
references using the Past Performance Form (provided in Attachment J-1).

              (2) In conducting this assessment, the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by the offeror and data obtained
from other sources.  If an offeror does not have a record of past performance or where information on past performance is not available, it will
not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably.


             (3) The Past Performance evaluation will consider recent and relevant past performance within the last two years for either
 commercial or government contracts similar in size, scope and work to the requirements identified in the solicitation.

M.6.5. Factor 3 – Price Factor

(1)  The proposed prices will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.

Completeness:  The team verifies that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented
in an adequate format.

Reasonableness:  The reasonableness of the proposed prices will be determined by adequate price competition and/or comparison to the Independent
Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).

The government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis to determine whether an offeror’s proposed prices are realistic for the
work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and are consistent with the various elements of the technical proposal.

(2) Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) - The price evaluation for all Offerors will be based on the total Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) for
each proposal using the discount factors identified below.

Evaluation Year (EY)   1     2    3     4    5
Evaluation Month (EM)  1-12  13-24      25-36      37-48 49-60
Discount Factor        0.984 0.952      0.922 0.893 0.864


(3)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the price for all options to the price for the base period
requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of
options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).



M.7 Color Code Rating Table for All Non-Cost Factors and Sub factors:  Each proposal will be assigned a risk and a color code rating in
accordance with the tables below for the evaluation criteria’s.

                                                                    25 Jun 09

1.  Task Order Title.  The Case Management and Tracking System (CMTS)

2.  Background.  The Department of Defense (DoD) has identified a need for better management, tracking and reporting of DoD Labor and Employee
Relations (LER) Cases at both the Department and Component levels.  Currently, each Component tracks cases through a variety of means, and all
Department-level reporting is done through just-in-time data calls.  This is labor intensive and results in data that is often not viable.   In
addition, one of the strategic goals of the Department is to design, develop and implement human resources policies, strategies, systems and
tools to ensure a mission-ready civilian workforce.

   3. Objectives:  The objective of this requirement is to acquire a Case Management and Tracking System (CMTS) that shall be a significant
      improvement to the management and administration of both the labor and employee relations programs within the Department.  The CMTS shall
      be an enterprise-wide, web-based tracking application that will provide an effective mechanism for all Components and Defense Agencies to
      manage and track all types of cases, a comprehensive repository for case information, on-line filing, electronic file management, and a
      full-featured report generation module to meet a variety of reporting requirements and program evaluation needs.  The CMTS will also be
      configurable to support current and future case management business rules and to accommodate changes in law, rule, or regulations.  The
      CMTS shall:


         • Enabling management of LER cases more efficiently;
         • Automating the process of obtaining required reports, eliminating the time consuming task of data calls and ensure better quality of
           data;
         • Providing management with a meaningful report capability that can identify LER program trends, individual or group training and
           performance improvement needs; and
         • Eliminate the duplication of cost and effort to maintain numerous tracking and/or management systems currently in place.
         • Deployment of an enterprise wide CMTS for labor and employee relations cases aligns with the CPMS Strategic Plan, Goal 4, "DoD had
           consistent, Enterprise-wide Human Resource (HR) Management Support," objective 4.3, "Develop and Implement HR Solutions."


4.  Scope.  The scope of the CMTS is to acquire Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software that will be purchased (not licensed/leased) by CPMS
with minimal configuration, software support services, including system maintenance.  The contractor shall propose a timeline for implementation
for the base year.

5.  Performance Requirements.

5.1. Task 1 - Integrated Solution

           (one server for primary and one for failover)
         • Database servers with easy and efficient expansion capability and internal failover/recovery capability, such as a Storage Area
           Network System, with enough initial storage space for 1-2 years of anticipated case information.  Note:  The Department of Defense
           has 1500 bargaining units, each with a collective bargaining agreement from 60-150 pages.  It is planned that the current and
           previous collective bargaining agreements will be kept in the database.  In addition, case files can vary from 10 to 200 pages each,
           and at an estimated 2% filing rate this would represent approximately 16,000 cases.
         • Fiber switches to serve as primary and backup switches for the purpose of failover protection between the application servers

5.4.  Task 4 – Contractor Supplied User Guidance and System Training

The Contractor shall provide a user guide in the form of a web linked document and/or appropriate “Help” screens embedded in the CMTS solution’s

7.  Incentives.  No incentives are anticipated at this time; however, a major failure on the part of the vendor, of more than 3 failures to meet
established timeframe for technical support/system correction, missed delivery deadlines by more than 5 workdays, may result in a 10% reduction
of invoice.

8.  Place of Performance   Meetings with the Government team will normally take place at CPMS, 1400 Key Blvd, Arlington, VA.  All other work,
i.e., configuration of the hardware/software, preparation of written materials can take place at either the vendor's location or in CPMS space,
as necessary, appropriate and mutually agreed upon.  User training will be conducted in the Metropolitan Washington Area, and two other
locations, most likely San Antonio, TX, and San Diego, CA.  Actual travel and per diem costs will be paid for instructor travel using government
authorized rates.

9.  Period of Performance.  The period of performance for this purchase order is one (1) year from Date of Award with an additional four (4) 1-
year options.  The option years will be for maintenance, software upgrades, and technical support.

       Summary of Principal Capabilities

The principal capabilities of the CMTS ate identified through an evaluation of user benefits and the related CMTS supporting features.  Sections
4 and 5 document the specific requirements related to these features.

The initial release of the CMTS will support the following case types:
      Employee Relations
            ✓ Adverse Actions/Appeals
            ✓ Administrative Grievances
            ✓ Challenging Rating of Record
      Labor Relations
            ✓ Negotiated Grievances
            ✓ Negotiations/Consultations
            ✓ Consultations
            ✓ Information Requests
            ✓ National Consultation Rights
      Federal Labor Relations Authority   Deleted reference to NSLRB
            ✓ Unfair Labor Practices (ULP)
            ✓ Negotiability
            ✓ Arbitration Exceptions
            ✓ Impasses
            ✓ Requests for Advisory Opinions

The CMTS will only be utilized for tracking cases with a start date after the initial release of the system to users.  It will not involve any
data conversion of existing case data, nor is it intended as a repository for case data from cases that are in progress or closed at the time
the system is operational.

|            |                   |3) activities (e.g., list cases where ADR was attempted)        |                 |
|            |                   |4) case status  (e.g., list all open cases within an            |                 |

|            |                   |due date in the next three months)                              |                 |
|            |                   |7) historical (e.g., list all cases involving a particular      |                 |
|            |                   |employee as the grievance)                                      |                 |

|            |                   |1) trends (e.g., quarterly count of negotiated grievance cases  |                 |
|            |                   |that went to the Board, number of “Challenging the Rating of    |                 |
|            |                   |Record” cases that involved the Pay Pool Panel).                |                 |
|            |                   |2) comparative analysis (e.g., compare count and outcomes of    |                 |
|            |                   |negotiations cases across installations within a component)     |                 |
|            |                   |3) case load (e.g.,  number of open cases by practitioners and  |                 |
|            |                   |by case type within an installation)                            |                 |
|            |                   |4) timeliness (e.g., number of Adverse Action cases completed   |                 |
|            |                   |within 3 months, 6 months, etc.,)                               |                 |
|            |                   |5) performance (e.g., count of cases by installation and type   |                 |
|            |                   |where ADR resulted in case closure).                            |                 |
|            |                   |6) effectiveness (e.g., number of extensions requested for      |                 |
|            |                   |specific deadlines)                                             |                 |

APPENDIX A – Case Type Event Diagrams


The NSPS case types are illustrated in this Appendix in the format of “Case Tracking Milestones & Requirements” diagrams.  These diagrams
illustrate the milestones or events that are significant in the life of a particular type of case.  The diagrams also document timers and
deadlines that are tracked as the case progresses, and suggest data requirements for each milestone.  Both the timers and data requirements may
be denoted as “(Optional)” if they are not required for every case of this type.

The following case types are included:

   1. Employee Relations - Administrative Grievances
   2. Employee Relations - Adverse Actions/Appeals
   3. Employee Relations - Challenging  the Rating of Record
   4. Employee Relations - Suitability
   5. Labor Relations - Negotiated Grievances
   6. Labor Relations - Negotiations/Consultations
   7. Labor Relations - Consultations
   8. Labor Relations - Information Requests
   9. Labor Relations - National Consultation Rights
  10. Labor Relations – Collective Bargaining Agreements
  11. National Security Labor Relations Board (NSLRB or the “Board”) or Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA)  Note:  The NSLRB will not be
      implemented, but the diagram is applicable to FLRA cases as well.
