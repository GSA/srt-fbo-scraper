This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for
Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement
constitutes the only solicitation; fixed price quotations are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number
is NAMA-10-Q-0119 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ), and quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does not commit the
government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or services.  Any
representations and/or certifications attached to this RFQ must be completed by the vendor.  The solicitation document and incorporated
provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-43 effective August 2, 2010.  COMPETITION, EVALUATION, AND
CONTRACT TYPE: This is an unrestricted procurement, subject to full and open competition.  The Government reserves the right to make an award on
the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106,
Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.  Award will be made to the vendor whose conforming
quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this award will be obtained through a lowest
priced technically acceptable evaluation.  For evaluation purposes, the firm-fixed price for each contract line item (CLIN) will be determined
by multiplying the Unit Price by the Maximum Quantity of units, and the Total firm fixed price will be determined by totaling the firm-fixed
price of each CLIN.  Vendors must provide pricing for each CLIN.  The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-shelf items.  In order to
facilitate a comprehensive Government evaluation, itemized technical specifications—that address each enumerated requirement of Attachment 2,
Salient Characteristics—MUST be submitted for CLINs 0001 and 0002 with quotations by ALL vendors.  The National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) intends to award an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract.  This anticipated contract shall be comprised of an
indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) CLIN that utilizes firm fixed unit prices for the purpose of effectuating orders.  The Government
guarantees that it will place orders for, at the very least, the Minimum Quantity for each CLIN with the successful vendor.  The initial order
will be placed immediately following award.  NARA may issue additional orders to the successful vendor for 12 consecutive months from date of
the IDIQ contract, up to the Maximum Quantity listed.  AFFIRMATION STATEMENTS: Vendors must confirm in their quote that all products quoted meet
the Energy Star® or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) energy use requirements.  All items quoted must be IPv6 compliant.  These products
comprising this requirement are required to be compliant with Section 508.  Supplies furnished under this RFQ are of domestic origin unless
otherwise indicated by vendor.  Vendors must include the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) Country of Production (for each CLIN) in their quotation
submissions in order to assist with verification of TAA compliance.  Vendors must complete and return Enclosure 2, RFQ Information Sheet, in
order for their quotations to be considered.  REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination pricing is requested for each CLIN, all delivery costs must be
included in total firm fixed price.  See Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  Submit pricing in accordance with the directions and tables in the
Schedule of Prices.  See Attachment 2, Salient Characteristics for specifications.  DELIVERY: Packaging must be in a manner that prevents damage
to the equipment during shipment.  Delivery must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon
by NARA and the Contractor.  Deliveries will be made in accordance with Attachment 1, Delivery Schedule.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 12 consecutive
months from date of contract.   SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS: Two copies of each quotation should be mailed to National Archives and Records
