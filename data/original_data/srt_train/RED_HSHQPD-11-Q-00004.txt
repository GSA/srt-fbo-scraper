United States Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Office of Research and Development Plum Island Animal Disease Center Request for Quotes HSHQPD-11-Q-00004 Statement of Work for the Select Agent Inventory FileMaker Pro Consultant/Developer 1.0 BACKGROUND The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) has been protecting America's livestock from foreign animal diseases since 1954. Dedicated to the advancement of knowledge related to and technology for the control and eradication of foreign animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, PIADC is a unique research facility whose mission includes the development of vaccines, performance of diagnostic testing, education, and implementation of various applied research projects. Located approximately 1.5 miles from the eastern end of Long Island's North Fork in New York, operational responsibility for PIADC was transferred from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to DHS in June 2003. Plum Island is a secure United States Government facility. DHS is committed to using cutting-edge technologies and scientific talent in its quest to make our nation safer. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland. An electronic Select Agent Inventory (SAI) program at PIADC is mandated by DHS and USDA. In order to support this program, a FileMaker Pro database has been developed to meet the requirements of both agencies and ensure that PIADC's Biosurety, Biosecurity and SAI procedures are implemented properly. Three groups on Plum Island, DHS, USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), will share and leverage a custom configuration of the FileMaker Pro application. Each of these groups of users has their own very distinct requirements. The current FileMaker Server 11 database consists of three files. The inventory, which is growing, contains in excess of one million records. Furthermore, there are 50 clients, each with a variety of security privileges for user access and reporting. The Government is seeking consulting and development assistance to improve the existing database. This FileMaker consultant/developer would be expected to complete an initial evaluation, and initiate some development under the oversight of an on-site FileMaker Pro developer/administrator. The principle place of performance will be at the DHS PIADC facility on Plum Island with the address 40550 Route 25 in Orient Point, New York, 11957. Title and ownership of the SAI FileMaker Pro database and any and all of its current and future configurations are and will remain property of the United States Government. Any and all deliverables also will become property of the United States Government and may not be disseminated without prior written approval from DHS.

2.0 OBJECTIVE The objective of the SAI FileMaker Pro Consultant/Developer project is to contract an experienced FileMaker Pro expert consultant and developer to improve the efficiency and usability of the SAI database. Furthermore, this work should not compromise the existing SAI system's intent to meet 9CFR121 record keeping requirements. 3.0 QUALIFICATIONS Technical Qualifications The individual performing this FileMaker Pro development work must be an expert FileMaker Pro version 11 Platinum Level certified consultant and an active member of the FileMaker Business Alliance (FBA) and TechNet with experience evaluating complex and large inventory system covering areas such as: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ FileMaker server configuration; User interface and interaction relating to workflow efficiency; Data modeling/structures; Programming quality and integrity; System security; and Deployment planning.

Clearance Qualifications The individual consultant/developer, considered to be key personnel, must have or be able to pass/obtain the requisite background investigation(s), suitability determination, security risk assessment and successfully complete required training that are consistent for individuals working for DHS at PIADC handling/importing select agent data. A confidentiality agreement also will be required. Work cannot commence until all of these clearance requirements have been satisfied. 4.0 SCOPE The scope of work is based on one (1) expert-level FileMaker consultant/developer utilized for an approximate potential total of between 240 and 280 man-hours. Advancement from CLIN 0001 to CLIN 0002 through CLIN 0006, which is set up as an exercisable option, is predicated upon the successful completion of CLIN 0001. CLIN 0007 is specifically for travel in support of CLINs 0001 through 0006. 4.1. CLIN 0001 ­ Evaluation of Existing Database and Recommendation of Improvements The objectives of firm fixed priced CLIN 0001 are to evaluate the existing database for efficiency and recommend corrective actions. During this evaluation process, the following aspects are of particular importance: 1. Server configuration. The current server configuration needs to be improved.

ATTACHMENT 1
event that some setting(s) or aspect(s) of the current configuration do not comply with FileMaker Pro Best Practices, then the contractor must identify any inconsistencies and recommend some corrective action(s). 2. Storage of inventory items. The current user interface is cumbersome. The contractor shall examine the current database architecture, which includes multiple layers of options for storage locations, and comment on the logic of the design for the purposes of developing a more user-friendly and intuitive interface that would provide end-users with a simpler method of and greater flexibility for placing inventory. 3. System performance. The database, as a tool, needs to perform faster. The contractor shall examine the database for the purposes of optimizing and increasing the performance speed of the tool. The contractor must review the current design then describe options that will improve general functionality. 4. Security. The database needs to have high-security and efficient user-access settings, including dual (two-factor) authentication, password complexity, and encryption. Use of the Scodigo Smart Pill is acceptable to meet the requirements listed above. Most users only have access to their own storage areas and data, which requires intricate privilege sets. 5. The contractor shall assess, provide recommendations, then provide a solution regarding Certification and Accreditation (C&A) that is compliant with federal regulations and policies to include: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ DHS Management Directive 0007.1 (http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/foia/mgmt_directive_0007_1_information_technolog y_integration_and_management.pdf): DHS Management Directive 4010.2 (http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/foia/mgmt_directive_40102_section_508_program_ management_office_and_information_technology_accessibility.pdf) DHS Management Directive 4300A (http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/nais/RFP/SectionJ/dhs-4300A-handbook.pdf); National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-37 Revision 1, "Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems" (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-37); and NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 3, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations" (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-53-Rev3/sp800-53-rev3-final_updatederrata_05-01-2010.pdf).

6. Auditing function. The database needs to be able to provide accurate and detailed audit reports along with easy access to the history of a record. The contractor shall review the performance of the current design and suggest possible restructuring. 7. Migration of existing data. The contractor shall review the existing data to be migrated and provide recommendations on completing the migration. Services for this CLIN are expected to take approximately 80 man-hours.

Contractors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore, all items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked. However, marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure. All FOIA requests for procurement material will be handled according to agency procedures at 6 CFR Part 5, Subpart B. Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this task order and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the task order. In performance of this task order, the Contractor assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and must ensure that all work performed by its subcontractors shall be under the supervision of the Contractor or the Contractor's responsible employees. Each officer or employee of the Contractor or any of its subcontractors to whom any Government record may be made available or disclosed must be notified in writing by the Contractor that information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for a purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and that further disclosure of any such information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 18 U.S.C. 641.

SECURITY FOR SENSITIVE REQUIREMENTS a. General

Performance of this task order requires the Contractor to gain access to Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) information. SBU is unclassified information for official use only. Contractor employees who do not have a security clearance and require access to SBU information will be given a suitability determination. Requirements for suitability determination are defined below in paragraph H.4.c. b. Contractor Personnel (i) Employment Eligibility

The Contractor will ensure that each employee and potential employee provides his/her name and social security number (not card) so that the Government may verify the validity of the number. If the number is not valid that employee will not be allowed to work on the task order until the problem is resolved. The Contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts and omissions of his employees as well as Subcontractor(s) and their employees. Subject to existing law, regulations and/or other provisions of this task order, illegal or undocumented aliens shall not be employed by the Contractor or perform on this task order. The Contractor shall ensure this provision is expressly incorporated into any and all subcontracts or subordinate agreements issued in support of this task order. (ii) Continued Eligibility

DHS reserves the right to deny and/or restrict entrance to government facilities, prohibit employees from assigned work under the task order, deny and/or restrict handling of classified documents/material to any Contractor employee who DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information. The Contractor shall report to the DHS Security Office any and all adverse information brought to their attention concerning employees performing under this task order. Reports based on rumor or innuendo shall not be included. The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported. (iii) Termination

The DHS Security Office shall be notified of all terminations/resignations within five (5) days of occurrence. The Contractor shall return to the COTR all DHS issued identification cards and building passes that have either expired or have been collected from terminated employees.

The individual shall interface with the DHS Security Office through the COTR on all security matters, to include physical, personnel, and protection of all sensitive documents/material handled by the Contractor. The COTR and DHS Security Office will have the right to inspect procedures, methods and facilities utilized by the Contractor to comply with the security requirements under this task order. Should the COTR or DHS Security Office determine the Contractor is not in compliance with the security requirements of the task order, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor, in writing, of the appropriate action that will be taken to rectify any non-compliance to the task order security requirements. c. Suitability Determination

DHS shall exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility and/or access to or handling of both classified and sensitive Government information to Contractor employees based upon the results of a background investigation. DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant a favorable Entry on Duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof. The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the task order. No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Security Office. Contract employees assigned to the task order not requiring access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening. Contract employees waiting for an EOD decision may begin work on the task order provided they do not access sensitive Government information. Limited access to Government buildings is allowable prior to the EOD decision if the Contractor is escorted by a Government employee. This limited access is to allow Contractors to attend briefings, non-recurring meetings and begin transition work. d. Background Investigations

All Contractor staff performing work at PIADC must submit applications for suitability screening based upon a Limited Background Investigation (LBI) for employment at PIADC. Prior to commencing work, results with no adverse findings from the Special Agency Check (SAC) or National Agency Check (NACI) investigation must be provided to the PIADC security department. Exceptions to this requirement may be granted by the PIADC Deputy Director of Operations. Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the task order, requiring access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the task order. The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted. All background investigations will be processed through the DHS Security Office. Prospective Contractor employees shall submit the following completed forms to the DHS Security Office. The Standard Form 85P will be completed electronically, through the Office of Personnel Management's e-QIP SYSTEM. The completed forms

HSHQPD-11-Q-00004 Page 24 of 50

ATTACHMENT 2
must be given to the DHS Security Office no less than thirty (30) days before the start date of the task order or thirty (30) days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Standard Form 85P, "Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions;" FD Form 258, "Fingerprint Card" (2 copies); Conditional Access To Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement; and Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the task order. Only complete packages will be accepted by the DHS Security Office. Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the task order. Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the United States for three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation. In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information. The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this task order for any position that involves access to or development of any DHS Information Technology (IT) systems. DHS will consider only U.S. Citizens and LPRs for employment on this task order. DHS will not approve LPRs for employment on this task order in any position that requires the LPR to access or assist in the development operation, management or maintenance of DHS IT systems. By signing this task order, the Contractor agrees to this restriction. In those instances where other non-IT requirements contained in the task order can be met by using LPRs, those requirements shall be clearly described.

ATTACHMENT 2
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

HSHQPD-11-Q-00004 Page 49 of 50

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
