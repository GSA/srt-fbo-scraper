52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Management, Technical, Past Performance and Price.

Management, Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important when combined, when compared to price.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision)
ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

   Competitive, Best Value Source Selection

This source selection is a best-value competitive source selection conducted in accordance with (IAW) the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)
15.3, as supplemented by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acquisition Regulations HSAM 3015.606-2 guidance.  The Government will select
the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Management, Technical, Past Performance, and Cost/Price factors.  To be eligible
for award, the Offeror must be deemed responsible IAW FAR 9.1; meet all requirements of the solicitation; conform to all required terms and
conditions; and include all required certifications, unless a proposed exception is accepted by the Government.  The Government seeks to award
to the Offeror who provides the best value in meeting and/or exceeding the requirements.  Even though price is a substantial factor in source
selection, best value trade-off may result in an award to a higher-rated, higher-priced Offeror, where the decision is consistent with the
evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical superiority and/or overall business
approach and/or superior past performance of the higher price Offeror outweighs the price difference.  While the Government source selection
evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore,
professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. Offerors who have a deficiency identified will not be considered for award.
Offerors with identified deficiency(ies) will not be considered for award. Proposals with unbalanced pricing may be determined to be ineligible
for award.

The Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not evaluated. The subcontracting plan will be reviewed and determined acceptable or not acceptable
(Go/No Go).

IAW HSAR 3052.209-72 Organizational Conflict of Interest, if an Offeror represents that it has included information in its proposal, providing
all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation
plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision and submits a proposed Mitigation Plan, the proposed plan shall be evaluated and may or
may not be approved. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of
the mitigation plan. 


   Factors Overview

In evaluating proposals, the Government will make tradeoffs among the factors, and select the proposal that is most advantageous to the
Government.  The SSA will select the Offeror whose proposal is considered the best value to the Government consistent with the factors listed
below.  When combined, non-cost/price factors are significantly more important than the cost/price factor.

   Factor Rating Information

Each proposal will be measured against the solicitation and its stated evaluation factors for award.  Proposals will not be compared or measured
against each other during the evaluation.  The evaluation focuses on compliance with solicitation requirements, objectives, considerations,
constraints and the proposal strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and other factors identified in the solicitation.  For the factors Management
and Technical, evaluators will evaluate risks associated with each factor.  Evaluators will assess the potential for disruption of schedule,
increased cost, degradation of performance, and the need for increased Government oversight, as well as the likelihood of unsuccessful contract
performance.  Each of the technical and management subfactors will receive one of the Proposal Risk ratings defined in the table below.

The Government will use specific evaluation discriminators in assessing the Offeror’s proposal for meeting ITFO requirements as stated in the
Statement of Work (SOW).  These discriminators are captured in table titled: Proposal Evaluation Definitions.

The Government will assign color ratings to Technical and Management factors.
The evaluators will use four (4) color codes to assign a color rating to each evaluation factor that results from applying the evaluation
criteria to each Offeror’s proposal.  The following definitions for color ratings will apply:

Technical and Management Color Rating Definitions

   EVALUATION


   Management Factor

Management IDIQ Approach.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s management approach to determine the degree to which the information
provided by the Offeror demonstrated the Offeror’s ability to efficiently describe how its management approach will lead to and control the
successful execution of this contract; the full range of business and technical management services that assist in the development,
implementation, and continuous improvement of procedures to the ITFO IDIQ.  These services encompass all areas of program management office
support. The evaluation will focus on compliance with solicitation requirements, proposal strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and performance
confidence.  The color ratings will be based on the evaluated strengths, weaknesses, and/or deficiencies of each Offeror’s proposal as they
relate to each of the Management elements.  Each Management element is of equal importance.

   MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Management Approach. The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s management approach to determine the degree to which the information provided by
the Offeror demonstrated the Offeror’s ability to provide management functions to perform ITFO Support Services at multiple locations through
out CONUS and OCONUS concurrently in accordance with the contract requirements and the following:

Organizational Structure.  Demonstrated managerial and supervisory ability to provide required Field Operations and related program management
support services IAW the contract SOW and Attachment 1 – Special Contract Requirements, including management control and supervision of the
organization; operational control; cost control methods (identify, monitor, and report contract costs); lines of authority for coordination;
interface/communication with the Government for performance of the requirements; manage an integrated team, inclusive of
subcontractors/teammates, staffing to perform multiple requirements concurrently, resumes for key personnel.

Management Plan and Capability.  Demonstrated management capability to efficiently deliver ITFO services and support across ICE; support
increasing workload; ability to temporarily increase staffing to respond to emergent or technically challenging assignment(s); adherence to
compliance with DHS and OCIO regulations, instructions.

TECHNICAL
The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the overall technical capability of each Offeror.  The evaluation will focus on
compliance with solicitation requirements and the SOW, proposal strengths, problems, deficiencies, and performance confidence.  Each technical
element is of equal importance.

The Contract Management and Operations Plan and all elements of that plan shall be evaluated to assess the Offeror’s overall approach to the
ITFO program, for consistency and overall logic.
The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror’s proposed Technical Approach demonstrates understanding of, and the ability to
efficiently meet ITFO requirements, objectives, considerations, constraints, and incorporation of phased requirements. Leverages existing Tools
(i.e. SharePoint, web-based applications, etc.) and executability of the Offeror’s proposed Technical Approach. The extent the Quality Control
Plan provides for appropriate Contractor oversight and surveillance, conducting internal reviews of deliverables, services and other work
products. Approach and plan for managing, controlling and continuing to provide high quality deliverables/services to meet the relevant
performance and quality standards that encompass the scope of requirements in the IDIQ SOW and subsequent task orders. Identification of
performance measures, and corrective actions.

An assessment of the Staffing, Records Management, Communications, Security, and Training Plans will include the following:
The logic of the Staffing Plan, how well it correlates with the work requirements to demonstrate an acute understanding of the contract
requirements, recruitment and retention of contractor personnel and  Key Personnel Resumes.

The offerors approach to training, retraining and refresher training of personnel in the Training Plan. The Offeror’s approach to ensuring
effective communication of program requirements to all of the program’s stakeholders and participants.

The logic and executiability of the proposed Emergency Readiness Plan to maintain continuity of operations.

The Government will conduct an over all assessment of the Offeror’s Transition Plan to ensure the proposed strategy provides a logical process
and methodology to provide adequate and timely training of contractor personnel, obtain required personnel security clearances and/or cleared
personnel and deploy personnel in a manner that provides an orderly transition from the incumbent within 60 days from date of award without
degradation of services.

   Past Performance Factor

The Past Performance evaluation assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an Offeror’s ability to perform. The Government will
conduct an overall assessment of confidence in the Offeror’s ability to fulfill the solicitation requirements while meeting budget, schedule,
and performance requirements.  Both the prime Offeror and teammate’s/subcontractor’s past performance will be evaluated.  The Government will
evaluate each Offeror's past performance conducting projects of similar dollar value, scope and complexity, as proven by the successful
management of current and previous contracts of a similar scope, magnitude, and complexity during the last three (3) years.  In performing this
evaluation, the Government will consider the Offeror's past performance information provided by the Offeror (3 – 5 past performance references)
and may consider information obtained from other sources.

Past performance will be assessed for recency, relevancy, and scope. Evaluators may augment questionnaire responses through dialogue with
contact persons completing the questionnaires.  Assessment may include Government site visit(s) and surveys of identified sources to validate
performance information.

If there is no relevant past performance information, past performance will be rated as neutral.

The Performance Confidence will receive one of the following ratings:

   Recency Assessment

The Government will assess past performance information to determine if it is recent.  For evaluation purposes, “recent” is defined as an effort
that is ongoing or being performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  If any part of the
performance falls within the above timeframe, the contract in its entirety may be evaluated for past performance.  For example, for a contract
completed two years ago, the Government may also consider the Phase-In portion of that contract that occurred more than three (3) years ago.
Past performance information that does not meet the above conditions will be considered not recent and will not be considered for evaluation.

Relevancy Assessment
The Government will evaluate recent performance information, including but not limited to past performance information and past performance
questionnaires data, to determine how closely the services performed under those contracts relate to the Technical, Management, and Cost/Price
factors.  In assessing relevancy, consideration will be given to, but not limited by, such items as similarity of the size, scope, complexity,
and contract type.  Additionally, the Government will consider the Offeror’s cited contract’s magnitude in terms of contract value, technical
content and complexity, problem resolution, lessons learned, and customer satisfaction.  The Government is not bound by the Offeror’s opinion of
relevancy.  The Government may consider as relevant, efforts performed for other agencies of federal, state, or local governments, and
commercial customers.

More relevant performance will have a greater impact on the performance confidence rating than less relevant efforts.  A strong record of
relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than a neutral/unknown confidence rating.  Likewise, a more
relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of
favorable performance.

   Adverse Findings

The assessment of past performance information may result in positive or adverse findings.  Adverse is defined as past performance information
that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received for which the Offeror has not had an
opportunity to respond.  The Offeror will be given an opportunity to respond to any adverse past performance information obtained by the
Government, which the Offeror did not previously have an opportunity to address.  Any adverse information identified, the evaluation will
consider the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in
sustained improvements.  Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated.
 If the Offeror clearly demonstrates management actions employed to overcome problems and the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements
achieved or problems rectified, this may allow the Offeror to be rated higher than might otherwise be indicated.

   Cost/Price Factor

The Cost/Price proposal will be reviewed for compliance with the requirements specified in the Instructions to Offerors (Addendum to 52.212-1)
of the solicitation.  The Offeror’s price proposal will be assessed, as appropriate, for completeness, affordability, price reasonableness, and
realism using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404.  This will include an evaluation of the extent to which proposed prices
indicate a clear understanding of the solicitation requirements, reflect a sound approach to satisfying those requirements, and are consistent
with the various methods of performance and materials described in the Offeror’s overall proposal.  If the reasonableness assessment indicates
the proposed price is excessively high or low, the Government may consider the Offeror to have a lack of understanding of the technical
requirements and the proposal may be considered unreasonable and/or unrealistic and may be excluded from further consideration for award.  The
Government reserves the right to make award based upon price in the event that the technical, management, and past performance factors and
subfactors of all the Offeror’s proposals are substantially the same.

Price proposals submitted by the Offeror will be evaluated for completeness based upon the submission requirements contained in the solicitation
instructions.  In addition, the Offeror’s price proposal including subcontractor(s) data will be evaluated based on the traceability to the
performance of the requirements addressed in the technical and management proposals.

The CO will make a determination of price reasonableness based upon receiving adequate competition in response to this solicitation.  In the
case that a determination of reasonableness cannot be made based upon competition, other procedures as defined in FAR 15.4 will be utilized.

When the Government evaluates an offer as unrealistically low and the Offeror fails to adequately explain these underestimated prices, the
Government will consider, under the Proposal Risk evaluation, the Offeror’s possible lack of understanding of the technical requirements of the
applicable Technical and/or Management factors.  The Offeror is advised to clearly show justification for unique practices that significantly
lower prices.

Compensation for Professional Employees:
The Government will evaluate Compensation for Professional Employees IAW FAR 52.222-46, - Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees,
offerors are required to submit for evaluation a total compensation plan setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional
employees working on the contract. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and
studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating
unrealistically low professional employee’s compensation may be assessed adversely as one of the factors considered in making an award.

Additional Definitions:
|Advantage                                |An advantage describes some element of a response that notably enhances an aspect of the   |
|                                         |Offeror’s ability to perform the effort or that represents a significant benefit to the    |
|                                         |Government which could be described a substantial monetary or time savings.                |
|Clarifications                           |Limited exchanges, between the Government and offerors that may occur when award without   |
|                                         |discussions is contemplated.  These limited exchanges may be used to clarify certain       |
|                                         |aspects of proposals (e.g., the relevance of an Offeror’s past performance information and |
|                                         |adverse past performance information to which the Offeror has not previously had an        |
|                                         |opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors.                            |
|DEFICIENCY                               |A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of      |
|                                         |significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract      |
|                                         |performance to an unacceptable level.  Examples of deficiencies include a statement by the |
|                                         |Offeror that it cannot or will not meet a requirement, an approach that clearly does not   |
|                                         |meet a requirement, or omission of data required to assess compliance with the requirement.|
|                                         |Offerors with identified deficiency(ies) will not be considered for award                  |
|UNCERTAINTIES OR APPARENT MISTAKES       |Includes any suspected errors, minor irregularities, apparent clerical mistakes,           |
|                                         |significant omissions, or uncertainties that make it difficult to understand what is being |
|                                         |offered and form a conclusion.  Examples include a mistake in a calculation or measurement |
|                                         |and contradictory statements.                                                              |
|Weakness                                 |A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A    |
|                                         |“significant weakness” in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of    |
|                                         |unsuccessful contract performance.                                                         |

                                                         SENSITIVE /UNCLASSIFED CONTRACTS

General
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of the task as described in ITFO Statement of Work, requires that the
Offeror, SubOfferor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Offeror) have access to sensitive ICE information.

The Offeror shall adhere to the following requirements.

Suitability Determination
DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding, or terminating unescorted Government facility and/or sensitive
Government information access for Offeror employees, based upon the results of a background investigation.  DHS may, as it deems appropriate,
authorize and make a favorable Entry On Duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks.  The favorable EOD decision would allow the
employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation.   The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not
be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof.  The granting of a favorable EOD
decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such
access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract.  No employee of the Offeror shall be allowed to EOD and/or access sensitive
information or systems without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Professional Responsibility, Personnel
Security Unit (OPR-PSU).  No employee of the Offeror shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD
decision or suitability determination by OPR-PSU.  Contract employees assigned to the contract not needing access to sensitive DHS information
or recurring access to DHS’ facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.

Background Investigations
Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive
information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract. The results of the
position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted.  Background investigations will be
processed through the Personnel Security Unit.  Prospective Offeror employees with adequate security clearances issued by the Defense Industrial
Security Clearance Office (DISCO) may not be required to submit complete security packages, as the clearance issued by DISCO may be accepted.
Perspective Offeror employees without adequate security clearances issued by DISCO shall submit the following completed forms to the Personnel
Security Unit through the COTR no less than 5 days before the starting date of the contract or 5 days prior to expected entry on duty of any
employees, whether a replacement, additional, Sub-Offeror employee, or vendor:

      Standard Form 86P, “Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions”. Form will be submitted via e-QIP (electronic Questionnaires for
      Investigation Processing)   (2 copies)


      FD Form 258, “Fingerprint Card” (2 copies)


      Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement


      DHS 11000-9, “Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act”


      Optional Form 306 Declaration for Federal Employment (applies to Offerors as well)


      Authorization for Release of Medical Information

Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract.  Only complete packages will be accepted by OPR-PSU.  Specific
instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract.

Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the U.S. for three of the past five years, the
Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation.  In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as
ineligible due to insufficient background information.

The use of Non-U.S. Citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position
that involves access to, development of, or maintenance to any DHS IT System.

Continued Eligibility
If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government facilities or
information, the COTR will advise the Offeror that the employee shall not continue to
work or to be assigned to work under the contract.

The OPR-PSU may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the Offeror independently identifies, circumstances where
probable cause exists.  The OPR-PSU may require reinvestigations when derogatory information is received and/or every 5 years.

DHS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict the facility and information access of any Offeror employee whose actions are in
conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government
information to which he or she would have access under this contract.

The Offeror shall report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to the OPR-PSU
through the COTR.  Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made.  The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not
obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employees’ name and social security number, along with the adverse
information being reported.

To avoid or mitigate a potential conflict, the CO will impose appropriate constraints, such as the following.
 
      (1) The Offeror agrees that if it provides, under a contract or TO, systems engineering and technical guidance for systems and programs,
but does not have overall contractual responsibility, it will not be allowed to be awarded a contract or TO to supply the system or any of its
major components or be a SubOfferor or consultant to a supplier of the system or any of its major components (FAR 9.505-1).
 
      (2)  The Offeror agrees that if it prepares specifications for non-developmental items or assists in the preparation of work statements
for a system or services under a contract or TO, it will not be allowed to furnish these items, either as a prime Offeror, a SubOfferor or as a
consultant (FAR 9.505-2).
 
      (3)  The Offeror agrees that if it gains access to proprietary data of other companies, it will protect such data and it will not use such
proprietary data in supplying systems or components in future competitive procurements (FAR 9.505-4).  In addition, the Offeror agrees to
protect the proprietary data and rights of other organizations disclosed to the Offeror during performance of any TO with the same caution that
a reasonably prudent Offeror would use to safeguard highly valuable property.  The Offeror also agrees that if it gains access to the
proprietary information of other companies, it will enter into an agreement with the other companies to protect their information from
unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for
which it was furnished.
 
      (4)  The Offeror agrees that it will not distribute reports, data or information of any nature arising from its performance under this
contract, except as provided by the TO or as may be directed by the TO CO.
 
      (5)   The Offeror agrees that it will neither evaluate nor advise the Government with regard to its own products or activities.  The
Offeror will objectively evaluate or advise the Government concerning products or activities of any prospective competitors.

      (6) The Offeror agrees that it will include the above provisions, including this paragraph, in agreements with teaming partners,
consultants or SubOfferors at any tier which involve access to information covered above.  The use of this clause in such agreements shall be
read by substituting the word "consultant" or "SubOfferor" for the word "Offeror" whenever the latter appears.
 
(f)  The Offeror shall effectively educate its employees, through formal training, company policy, information directives and procedures, in an
awareness of the legal provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5 and its underlying policy and principles so that each employee will know and understand the
provisions of that Subpart and the absolute necessity of safeguarding information under a TO from anyone other than the Offeror's employees who
have a need to know, and the U.S. Government.
 
(g)  The term Offeror herein used means: (1) the organization (hereinafter referred to as "it" or "its") entering into this agreement with the
Government; (2) all business organizations with which it may merge, join or affiliate now or in the future and in any manner whatsoever, or
which hold or may obtain, by purchase or otherwise, direct or indirect control of it; (3) its parent organization if any and any of its present
or future subsidiaries, associates, affiliates, or holding companies, and; (4) any organization or enterprise over which it has direct or
indirect control now or in the future.
 
(h)  In connection with a particular constraint, the Offeror may submit a response to the TO CO for the purpose of indicating potential measures
to avoid or mitigate a conflict.  In the event the TO CO determines that a conflict exists which cannot be effectively mitigated the provision
in FAR 9.5 must be followed.


Reporting an Accident with a Government-Owned Vehicle
Standard Form 91 (Rev 2-93), entitled “Motor Vehicle Accident Report” will be placed in the glove compartment of any Government vehicle (GOV).
Any contractor employee who has an accident while responsible for the GOV must fill out Standard Form 91 and submit a copy to the Government
Office that issued the vehicle.  The Site Manager for the site from which the vehicle was issued should be informed simultaneously.  In
addition, the contract employee must report the accident to his/her Manager to ensure the appropriate reports are completed.
If the vehicle can be driven without further injury to it and without danger to the driver, it should be returned to the Government Office from
which it was issued, along with the accident report.  Otherwise, the issuing Government office shall be contacted for direction related to
proper procedures for delivering the vehicle to a place of safekeeping (e.g., towed to a service station).
If the contractor personnel’s driving the vehicle is injured and unable to properly dispose of the vehicle or complete Standard Form 91, the
contractor manager will complete these actions and coordinate matters relating to the accident with the Government.

STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1   Background
The Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will provide the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) Information
Technology Field Operations (ITFO) Branch with information technology services and support for evolving needs in both the Continental United
States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  The (ITFO) Branch, within the OCIO, Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), provides world-wide enterprise level Information Technology (IT) Operations & Maintenance (O&M)
services for over 900 offices and over 26,000 users which includes the mobile workforce.  Currently, services are provided to ICE Programs and
administrative offices.  ITFO may be required to coordinate (when necessary) with other DHS components as well as with other Government agencies
outside of DHS to include, but not limited to, the Department of Treasury, Department of State, and state and local entities both within the
CONUS and OCONUS.  However, the ITFO Branch may have additional requirements and optional tasks that require support services.  The ITFO
organizational structure breaks down IT responsibilities into geographic areas, including OCONUS locations. (Appendix A) The Program Management
and ITFO O&M IT support are comprised of some or all components described within this statement of work and may be tailored to meet the agency’s
mission needs. Work shall be performed at headquarters and/or field offices located throughout the world, as specified in each Task Order (TO).

C.2   Scope
The Contractor shall provide technical and program management support services to ICE end users and ITFO. The majority of the support will be by
resolution of Tier II tickets, occasional telephone requests or by providing support to ITFO Information System Security Officer (ISSO), the
Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative(s) (COTR) and the Government Technical Task Monitor(s) (TTM).  Tier II tickets are any issues
that the Service Desk is unable to resolve. Tier II Tickets are generally received via BMC Remedy. The current BMC Remedy version is Version
7.1.0, patch 3.  Either a COTR or TTM may be assigned and identified to monitor Contractor performance on individual TO(s).

The Contractor shall closely monitor the activities and performance to prevent deviation(s) from the statement of work or increase of the cost
estimates as identified in the individual TO(s).  All anticipated increases in costs and/or deviations from the statement of work shall be
coordinated with the Contracting Officer (CO), in writing, and approved by the CO prior to any deviations.

The Contractor shall establish surge resources and staffing procedures to ensure its capacity to provide additional staffing and resources on
short notice.  The Contractor shall identify, schedule, and utilize resources, as coordinated with the Government, to minimize or limit
disruptions in the performance of the TOs issued under this contract.  At no time, shall the availability of the Contractor staff impede the
normal day to day operations as described in the individual TO(s).

The Contractor shall continue to perform this contract during abnormal site conditions caused by any emergency, event, or incident on a national
or local scale.  Whereas this contract is not intended to replace, mimic, or fulfill a Disaster Recovery requirement, the scope of the contract
is comprehensive and is intended to establish sufficient flexibility to support the full complement of IT services required to fulfill the ITFO
mission.  Therefore, the Contractor may be required and shall support DHS-ICE-OCIO from remote areas, such as other DHS components, state or
alternate local facilities, in the event that the ICE normal work areas are inaccessible for any reason.  As coordinated by the Government, the
Contractor shall pre-deploy or pre-stage its staff to assist local staff prepare for an emergency, event, or incident prior to its onset as
timely predicted.  In the same manner, the Contractor shall also deploy its staff in the wake of or after the impact of an emergency, event, or
incident.  The Contractor shall report to the COTR and TTM the status and location of all Contractor staff located in specified areas during
deployments.

All support and services provided under this contract will be of the highest standard.  World class customer service will be expected and can be
measured by the lack of complaints and the frequency of positive comments from ICE customers.

All resources required for this contract shall be available according to the Government’s required hours of operation.  If these hours of
operation change the Contractor shall adhere to the changes.  The Government will provide as much advance notifications as is possible.
