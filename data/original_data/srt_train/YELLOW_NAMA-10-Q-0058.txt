College Park, MD 20740-6001



Microsoft Enterprise Agreement 



IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF THE DOCUMENT AS A "LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION."



See Page 1



NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED.



NARA requires approval of the use of other than full and open competition procedures in order to limit the competition to Vendors able to provide brand name only items, specifically for Microsoft Enterprise Software Assurance with True Up, Premier Support Services, and Risk Assessment Programs.  The Vendors must be certified authorized resellers of Microsoft Products and Services.  These brand name requirements are the only items that can meet 's need.  



III.	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY’S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE).



 needs the (a) desktop operating system, (b) business productivity tools such as Microsoft Office, (c) business diagramming tools such as Visio and finally (d) a low-cost yet highly scaleable relational database such as SQL Server to satisfy the desktop, server and applications requirements at .  The Software Assurance on the enterprise software package will include the following products: 4409 copies of Office Professional Licenses, 4609 copies of Windows XP Professional, 4609 copies of Windows Server CAL, 300 copies of Project Pro, 66 copies of  Project Standard, 278 copies of Visio Standard, 20 copies of Visio Pro, 15 copies of SQL Server, 1 copy of Project server, 23 copies of Microsoft Enterprise Server, and 188 copies of Window Standard Server.  Also included are three Risk Assessment Programs and Microsoft Premier Support hours.  The estimated value of the forthcoming order for the Software Assurance, Support Service hours, and Risk Assessment Programs for the next three years is approximately $948,000 per year, with a three year total of approximately $2.84 million.



AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN   OPEN COMPETITION.



Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as prescribed by FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii).



V.	A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED VENDOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED.



The primary reasons NARA seeks to limit competition to the Microsoft brand are: 1) NARA currently owns the aforementioned software which means the pricing will be far less to continue Software Assurance rather than select a new product and have to repurchase it;  2) the avoidance of the exorbitant costs associated with training the user base of 4609 individuals on new software; 3) the IT support helpdesk would likely have to handle more trouble tickets related to issues arising from the deployment of new products thereby incurring increased costs on that particular task order; 4) the lost productivity of NARA staff during transition; and 5) the costs associated with converting the data NARA has maintained via Microsoft products for the past eighteen years in the case of some data types.  Furthermore, a piecemeal solution would likely require integration services to incorporate the various products used to create the total solution.  



Benefits for NARA include: 1) the cost savings garnered from reduced annual license costs via Software Assurance; 2) maintaining one agency baseline as opposed to a plethora; 3) decreased legal risk exposure derived from juggling a litany of license agreements; and 4) the ability to overcome the trouble associated with either buying OEM software or software on a just-in-time basis.



The above mentioned costs and commensurate benefits are extreme when compared with potential savings obtained from purchasing a lesser priced product from another manufacturer.  



VI.	A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS  SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 , IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES.



This requirement will be posted on FedBizOpps using a combined synopsis solicitation as enumerated in FAR Part 12 in order to maximize potential competition.  Furthermore, this will provide other than brand name Vendors notice of the requirement.



.	A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED  TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR  REASONABLE.



A firm-fixed price purchase order will be issued and since two or more vendors are likely to submit quotations, adequate competition will render the resultant purchase order price fair and reasonable.  A purchase order will be issued to the vendor that provides the lowest price technically acceptable quotation. 



VIII.	A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED ( PART 10)  THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED



Market research was conducted and NARA has determined that there is no combination of operating system, business productivity software, diagramming software, project management software, and low-cost scaleable relational database on open market that matches those proposed here for price and performance.  Since NARA currently owns the above mentioned Microsoft products, it would be cost prohibitive for them to seek a new solution compared to using the existing software and continuing on maintenance using Software Assurance.  The benefit of the Software Assurance is that the initial expenditure was made in years 07-09.  For years 10-12 the only other viable option is to replace the Office software with a product like WordPerfect Office X5.  On both GSA schedule and open market WordPerfect is more expensive than SA for the next 3 years. 



NARA has investigated other potential products during the market research for this procurement; however, many of the lesser priced products did not offer comparable software capability.  The more expensive products may have had increased capability, but the need for the increased capability does not exist, and when considering the fact that NARA would not only pay more for the product but, would also have the transition costs to consider, obtaining these more expensive products at an Enterprise level becomes untenable.



IX.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN   OPEN COMPETITION.   FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)	



This represents the renewal of Software Assurance and there is an understanding that this is not a software purchase, but a continuance of maintenance on software already purchased by NARA.  Software Assurance will apply to the products that NARA now owns (Office, Visio, etc) from the previous contract and can only be provided by Microsoft through their partners.  

The benefits of software Assurance include not only the version upgrades to like products (I.E. Visio Standard 2007 to Visio Standard 2010), but access to professional support hours, Risk Assessment Programs, E-Learning, training hours, and the Employee Home Use program.  If a decision was made to terminate Software Assurance, in addition to the losses of the above mentioned benefits, NARA would then incur the burden of training and lost productivity.  The loss of productivity and additional needed training needed to move users to new software significantly adds to replacement cost of software. 



X.	A LISTING OF THE SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION


N/A



XI.	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY  TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED



Operating systems and business productivity tools, in general, cannot be easily replaced without adding significant costs for training, transition, and transferring or converting existing files and data.  There is also a time factor involved, as the conversion of more than a decade's worth of files and data into a different format would take years.  



NARA continues to conduct market research in an effort to improve service and meet agency goals.


XII.	CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION THAT THE JUSTIFICATION IS ACCURATE  COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER’S KNOWLEDGE  BELIEF
