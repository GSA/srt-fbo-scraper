Introduction

Introduction
Summary
The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Manual provides a formal, integrated and streamlined approach to managing system development projects within the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This manual serves as a guidance tool, outlining OCC governance, policies, standards and procedures as they pertain to the SDLC. The SDLC emphasizes best practices and decision processes that enhance the effectiveness of system development projects and the systems delivered by Information Technology Services (ITS) working jointly with OCC Business Units. The SDLC Process is comprised of an introductory SDLC Tailoring sub-process followed by eight distinct life cycle phases:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

Planning Phase Requirements Definition Phase Design Phase Development Phase Test Phase Implementation Phase Operations and Maintenance Phase Disposition Phase

SDLC v.3.1.1 incorporates strong control mechanisms and reference tools at key decision points in the SDLC Process, including: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Deliverables representing key technical documents Formal deliverable reviews and approvals Formal technical reviews and approvals Defined phase entry and exit criteria

This progression ensures that sound decisions are made during the systems development life cycle process to result in the creation of effective information technology (IT) systems.

Scope
The SDLC process is suitable for all IT environments, with applicability to both contractually developed and internally developed systems within OCC. This includes custom developed systems as well as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) system implementations. Additionally, SDLC applies to projects including new systems as well as enhancements to existing systems in operation requiring capital fund expenditures. SDLC Tailoring offers systems development project managers the capability to modify the SDLC process to

Introduction

accommodate specific project needs. It is imperative that a development project receives proper approval from the project sponsor or Investment Review Board (IRB), as applicable, before system development activities are initiated.

Authority
OCC's SDLC is governed by several statutes that focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of federal agencies by regulating their operational and management practices. These laws include: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The Federal Records Act of 1950 (FRA) The Freedom of Information Act of 1966 (FOIA) The Privacy Act of 1974 (PA) The Financial Officer Act of 1990 (CFOA) The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (CCA) The Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998 (GPEA) The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) The E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347)

Background
OCC, like most federal organizations, finds itself increasingly reliant on IT as an effective tool to help meet customer needs and remain in compliance with federal eGovernment legislative mandates. Due to the proliferation of IT usage and escalating costs within the federal government, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for increased accountability relative to planning and use of IT investments. The Capital Planning Investment Control (CPIC) process is OMB's mandate to federal agencies to ensure positive returns on IT investments. In response, OCC has established internal IT accountability standards by employing systems development methods such as the SDLC that introduce control mechanisms for development projects. The OCC SDLC process was first developed in 2004, based on industry best practices and standards that enhance the effectiveness of system development projects. All system development projects initiated within the OCC since April 1, 2005 have been recommended to employ the SDLC. Since then, various revisions to the OCC SDLC process have enhanced formal oversight, governance and change controls. The release of v.3.1 represents a streamlined approach to the OCC SDLC process. ITS executives identified the streamlining of the SDLC process as a priority activity that will improve the efficiency of systems delivery at OCC. In producing v.3.1.1, the SDLC Program Office conducted a thorough analysis of existing processes and worked closely with an SDLC Working Group - established to represent the collective interest and expertise of ITS and key Program Management Offices - to

Introduction

prioritize and implement process improvements. The following objectives guided SDLC streamlining: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Streamline processes to improve efficiency and reduce potential time, resource and cost burdens on project managers Remove redundant, conflicting and erroneous information to improve the quality of process documentation Fill process gaps to ensure that all desired outcomes are accounted for Reduce volume of documentation to aid expert users Improve the clarity of procedures used throughout the process Improve the usability of forms, checklists and deliverables aiding the process Align and document processes according to industry best practices and peer benchmarks

As a result of the SDLC streamlining effort, the SDLC Manual v.3.1.1 represents an improvement of existing content, rather than the creation of a new SDLC process. This is intended to enhance the ability of stakeholders to apply standard practices in order to efficiently manage system development projects to completion.

IT Governance, Policy, Standards, and Procedures
The OCC SDLC is a guideline. As defined by the IT Policies, Standards and Procedures Framework, a guideline is a recommendation intended to facilitate the adoption and successful fulfillment of a specific policy, standard or procedure. A guideline clarifies a course of action in order to achieve objectives set out in policy. To that end, the OCC SDLC is a recommended guideline to achieve the OCC's IT objectives while remaining in compliance with both internal and external policies, standards and procedures. Although compliance with the OCC SDLC is not mandatory, all system development projects are subject to compliance reviews and audits, which assess system alignment with ITS objectives and the OCC governance, policies, standards and procedures. SDLC Program Office The SDLC Program Office, a division of the ITS Business Services Delivery organization, provides ongoing support to the agency with the objective of delivering high quality IT products and services to OCC's internal and external customers and stakeholders. The SDLC Program Office provides the enterprise framework necessary to establish and implement best practices and processes for the agency which will ensure that OCC's systems are developed securely, effectively, on time and within budget. Specific functions of the SDLC Program Office include: supporting and managing the SDLC process, maintaining SDLC documentation, training stakeholders on SDLCrelated activities and providing direct support to SDLC end users.

The SDLC Program Office maintains SDLC documentation online within the OCC Microsoft SharePoint environment and provides an email address for end user support. Stakeholders can access these resources via the following links: ˇ ˇ SharePoint site: http://share/sites/CIO/SDLC/default.aspx Email: SDLCHelp@occ.treas.gov

Complementary Program Areas The SDLC process relies heavily on a number of standards, policies and procedures under the purview of other program offices, both within and outside of ITS. For an up-to-date inventory of these policies, standards and procedures, please contact the offices directly (see listing below), or the Office of IT Governance, Policy and Procedures. Below is a brief description of each complementary program area. Generally technical Subject Matter Expects (SME) from each of these program areas participate in activities throughout the SDLC. Capital Planning Investment and Control Program Office: The objective of the CPIC Program Office is to facilitate the decision-making process that ensures IT investments integrate strategic planning, budgeting, procurement and IT management in support of the OCC's mission, goals, objectives and business needs. During the SDLC process, CPIC acts as a control gate through which system development projects must pass in order receive continued funding. Data Management Services Program Office: The objective of the Data Management Services Program Office is to establish and support enterprise data standards for quality, security, usability, availability, consistency and sharing capabilities. During the SDLC process, the Data Management Services Program Office ensures that the system is in compliance with data management standards and monitors data management-related activities. Enterprise Architecture Program Office: The objective of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Program Office is to ensure that projects address the relationship between the IT investment and the business, performance, data, services, application and technology layers of the agency's enterprise architecture.

Introduction

OCC SDLC Process Overview
Key SDLC Principles The OCC SDLC process is founded on the following key principles: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Consistency with accepted industry best practices and standards A comprehensive technical Project Management Plan to track, measure and control the progress of each system development project SDLC tailoring options for alternative system development project work patterns to ensure flexibility in responding quickly to meet business needs Accountability through work product and progress reviews at key decision points in the SDLC Process Clear, accurate and thorough documentation of activity results and decisions throughout the SDLC Process Formal review, concurrence and approval of all SDLC deliverables by stakeholders across the agency based on their predefined SDLC roles and responsibilities.

SDLC Overview The SDLC Process is comprised of an introductory SDLC Tailoring sub-process followed by eight distinct life cycle phases. High-level objectives of the phases are shown in the diagram below.

Introduction

Notably, the precise sequence of SDLC phases may vary between projects. Factors such as business needs and constraints, technical needs and constraints, and contractual obligations commonly lead project managers to use different system development methodologies for different projects. OCC SDLC guidance provides a standard, structured foundation for all projects, regardless of the technical development approach selected, such as custom software development as well as COTS/GOTS software implementation. An SDLC work pattern can be established to suit individual project needs through SDLC Tailoring. Additionally, system development plans, standards and procedures can be established during SDLC Planning activities. The flexibility inherent in the OCC SDLC accommodates a variety of system development methodologies including: waterfall ­ with each phase following in sequence; iterative ­ with multiple small releases each delivering a portion of the planned system capabilities; and spiral ­ with multiple small releases, but when user needs are not fully known at the outset and each iterative release serves to refine system requirements (e.g., prototyping a system concept and then refining the prototype through successive iterations). As shown in Figure 1 above, if an SDLC work pattern is planned with multiple releases, each release would involve a sub-cycle of Requirements Definition, Design, Development, Testing, and Implementation activities. Following the first release, the system would be in a mixed life cycle state (i.e., partially in operation and partially under development) until all planned releases are complete. In this regard, SDLC guidance on key process elements for each phase is applicable to all projects, regardless of the chosen business or technical approach. SDLC Deliverables SDLC deliverables are technical artifacts that document the results of activities and decisions throughout the system development process. Deliverables may be initiated and completed in a single phase or may require regular updates throughout several phases of the project. They are referenced throughout the description of SDLC phases, in order to identify when the outcomes of technical activities should be documented. Sixteen deliverables are identified in SDLC v.3.1.1. Predefined templates for these deliverables are published together with SDLC guidance in the Appendix C of this manual. In a few instances, as noted in SDLC guidance, deliverable content as well as deliverable templates is defined and maintained by complementary program areas. Once a development project is underway, and deliverables as well as other project documentation begin to be produced, those artifacts should be maintained in an electronic library specific to the project (see SA procedures). This should be conducted in accordance with relevant project management, records management and configuration management policies, standards, procedures and guidelines. In addition, access control for the electronic library should be configured to permit access to all project stakeholders who may need to review project documentation over the life of the project.

Introduction

SDLC Reviews Throughout the SDLC process, reviews are conducted as a quality assurance mechanism to effectively monitor both the technical aspects of system development and the documentation of the technical work. Two types of formal reviews ­ Technical Reviews and Deliverable Reviews ­ are discussed in greater detail below. Technical Reviews The SDLC Process includes three Technical Reviews. These are live reviews, with stakeholders gathered in person, placed at key decision points in the SDLC. Project artifacts are reviewed and progress is discussed in a format conducive to the exchange of technical ideas and the identification and reduction of risk. They also serve to ensure that all technical aspects of the system are traceable back to original project objectives and requirements. Below is a brief description of the three Technical Reviews within the SDLC Process. These reviews are identified in the context of the SDLC process in the phase descriptions that follow. In addition, detailed procedures for each review are provided in Appendix B of this manual: ˇ Requirements Review ­ This review occurs during the Requirements Definition Phase and is conducted to verify that requirements are complete according to SDLC guidelines. Requirements are evaluated to ensure that they are necessary and sufficient, and that they adequately balance stakeholder needs and constraints. Critical Design Review ­ This review occurs during the Design Phase and is conducted to formally evaluate the technical adequacy of the system architecture and design before formal development begins. Release Readiness Review ­ This review, also referred to as "Go / No Go," occurs at the end of the Test Phase and is meant to ensure that the system is ready for implementation. The review verifies that the system has passed all testing, implementation planning is adequate and deployment risks are within an acceptable range.

ˇ ˇ

Deliverable Reviews Once a deliverable is completed, it requires formal review, concurrence and approval from various technical stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs) in order to validate and verify its content. The Deliverable Review process by which deliverables are approved is governed by quality assurance procedures maintained by the QM Program Office. For SDLC process verification, a Deliverable Review Report template is provided in SDLC v.3.1.1, to be completed by the project manager at the conclusion of each Deliverable Review. In addition, a deliverable checklist for each deliverable is provided in SDLC v.3.1.1 to aid reviewers when evaluating technical documentation. The Deliverable Review Report template and deliverable checklists are provided in Appendix C of this document.

Introduction

Timing of Deliverables and Reviews Deliverables in the SDLC Process may be initiated and completed in a single phase or may require update and elaboration throughout several phases of the process. Once a deliverable has been completed, it should be finalized and approved by means of a formal Deliverable Review. Unlike deliverables, Technical Reviews are conducted and finalized within a single phase. Technical Reviews generally serve as phase gates to help project managers verify completeness of SDLC artifacts before proceeding into successive phases.

SDLC Document Structure The SDLC process is presented in this manual using a process documentation framework that has been adapted from methods published by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) 1. This framework provides a structured pattern to effectively describe the process and procedure components of a business process. Eight critical process elements are covered in detail for the primary aspects of the SDLC process. The definitions of the critical process elements are shown in the figure below.

* Note: If a Project Management Plan was initiated prior to this stage, the existing plan should be updated with system development planning details. If a Project Management Plan does not yet exist for the project, it should be initiated at this stage. 1.4.2. Refine system concept (WBS 1.2) This step ensures that the system concept established during project initiation is refined in a manner that enables upcoming requirements generation and preliminary design. The project team translates high level business needs and system concepts into a description of how the system will operate from a user's perspective. In conjunction, initial technical attributes of the system are also documented at this stage, and preliminary work can be conducted to support organizational change management objectives. The PMO PM and ITS PM collaborate to conduct the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Examine Planning Phase inputs to verify the business process to be supported, the proposed system concept and the benefits sought Develop concepts for the proposed system, including how users will interact with the proposed system and the initial logical overview of system components and the support environment

1.4.3. Develop system security approach (WBS 1.3) In this step, personnel evaluate the scope of the planned system to determine whether the project requires formal Certification and Accreditation (C&A), and begin planning the information security approach for the project*. This activity is informed by the system inventory placement determined during SDLC tailoring as well as system concept refinements made in parallel during this phase. * Note: Not all projects will follow C&A procedures. The specific security approach for each system may differ based on a number of factors as documented in policies, standards and procedures maintained by IRM. The PMO PM and ITS PM collaborate with representatives from IRM to conduct the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Establish points of contact between project team and IRM Review existing information security policies, guidelines and standards published by IRM Begin developing project-specific security plan Begin executing tasks according to IRM policies, standards, procedures and guidelines Establish calendar for C&A activities Update draft Project Management Plan with aspects of security approach

1.4.4.

Activities
This section provides detail on each activity in the Requirements Definition Phase, including a brief description of its purpose, a summary of roles involved, a list of tasks and references to supporting artifacts. 2.4.1. Develop functional requirements (WBS 2.1) The first step in the Requirements Definition Phase is to translate business needs and preliminary requirements into detailed functional requirements. Specifically, a comprehensive description of system functionality is developed based on the end users' standpoint. Note: Beginning at this stage, requirements should be managed according to procedures associated with the system development methodology selected. For example, a system development project may choose to describe functional requirements in terms of use cases. Additionally, projects may build disposable prototypes for discussion with end users, in order to reduce the ambiguity of difficult functional requirements. SDLC activities should be structured according to the methodology selected. Requirements analysts on the development team interact directly with business users and/or their representatives to conduct the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Define hierarchy of requirement types and establish framework for requirements traceability Configure requirements tracking system, if one is being used; for example, several organizations within OCC utilize software from the Rational Team Unifying Platform COTS product suite to support

software development workflow ­ this and other technologies may be leveraged to increase SDLC efficiency and support quality objectives Verify OCC and applicable business unit(s) strategic objectives, business problems and opportunities, stakeholder needs and high-level system features Identify applicable business processes and user classes Establish functional requirements for each user class Establish initial data requirements Update draft Requirements Document and populate the requirements tracking system

2.4.2. Validate functional requirements (WBS 2.2) This activity confirms that the functional requirements accurately define how end users will use the system. This step should be conducted with the participation of technical personnel so that there is a collective understanding of functional requirements by the development team before detailed operational and technical requirements are generated. Note: If prototypes have been developed to aid requirements definition, they should be disposed once functional requirements are validated and should not become part of the final system. The PMO PM and ITS PM lead requirements analysts and technical stakeholders through the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Conduct a meeting to review completeness and accuracy of individual functional requirements; leverage process inputs during the evaluation Identify the sequencing of time-critical functions Determine key requirements which will be used to track progress Update draft Requirements Document and requirements tracking system

2.4.3. Develop functional architecture and system requirements (WBS 2.3) This activity serves to further refine functional requirements into systemlevel requirements expressed in technical terms. Initial design concepts and logic begin to take shape. All requirements developed in this step should be traced to the functional requirements defined previously. The ITS PM leads the development team and applicable technical stakeholders through the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Group requirements logically based on established criteria (e.g., similar functionality, performance needs, etc.) Allocate user requirements to functional groupings

2.4.4. Allocate system component requirements (WBS 2.4) This step results in the allocation of system performance, design constraints and fit, form and function for all system components previously identified. The activity should be repeated until all components have been addressed. This activity can be conducted in parallel with development of system interface requirements. The ITS PM leads the development team and technical stakeholders, as needed, through the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Allocate functional and performance requirements to system components Allocate design constraints to system components* Document relationships among allocated requirements Document requirements traceability Update draft Requirements Document, draft Design Document and requirements tracking system

*Note: In some instances, an "Accessibility Plan" will be required. This occurs primarily when COTS solutions and services are being acquired. If the solution involves this type of purchase, consultation with the Section 508 Program is needed. The Section 508 Program should be included in the solicitation, evaluation and selection process. 2.4.5. Develop interface requirements (WBS 2.5) This step establishes the functionality of external interfaces, including identification of data to be transferred, data volume, frequency of transfer and overarching performance requirements. This activity should be repeated for each interface. This activity can be conducted in parallel with allocation of system component requirements. The ITS PM leads the development team and applicable technical stakeholders through the following tasks: ˇ Develop the functional requirements for the identified interfaces

2.4.6. Conduct Requirements Review (WBS 2.6) This activity is a formal Technical Review conducted to verify the adequacy of documented requirements and validate whether a system developed according to them will meet the business need. This review should be conducted according to Technical Review process guidelines (see SDLC 3.1.1 Technical Reviews). The ITS PM appoints a Review Leader to oversee and coordinate the review, and directs the project team as follows: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Follow Requirements Review process Continue activities according to review decision--Proceed or Revise Requirements and Re-Inspect Revise requirements as required, in order to resolve all issues and defects identified during the review Update deliverables as necessary Review and complete revisions to IT cost estimates which include detailed estimates for the Design through Implementation phases (see CEM guidance) Outputs ­ Requirements Review Action Log and Requirements Review Report

When initiating the Requirements Review process, the Review Leader is advised to develop custom review objectives and criteria. A recommended set of criteria from which to draw includes: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Are the requirements necessary? Are the requirements sufficient to address stated business problems, opportunities or needs? Do the requirements demonstrate an organizational benefit that is traceable to OCC business objectives and processes? Are the requirements complete, to include specifications for: processes, data, interfaces, operations and security? Are the requirements complete and representative of all user classes and stakeholders?

Verify that IRM representatives have sufficient information to establish methods and procedures for security assessments

4.4.2. Establish development environments (WBS 4.2) This step establishes physical environments according to detailed specifications and plans specified in the Requirements Document and Test Plan deliverables. These environments consist of the services, connections, database and application servers, infrastructure and/or desktop computers required to support system development and system development testing. Developers on the project team conduct the following tasks according to documented specifications: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Coordinate with TI and ETT personnel, as needed, to install and configure environments for system development and system development testing Coordinate with ITS Data Management Services to configure database environments as planned Coordinate with SA to initiate build documentation Update draft Test Plan with configuration information for the system development and system development testing environments, as needed

4.4.3. Develop system components and interfaces (WBS 4.3) Typically systems have multiple components and/or interfaces. This step should be repeated for each system component and interface in the design. Once one or more components have been successfully developed, the project team should establish physical connections between components and external systems to support the business logic specified in the system design. Note that depending on the system development methodology being used, the exact sequence of development activities may vary between projects. The ITS PM arranges assistance from technical SMEs and leads the project team through the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Develop software code, configure COTS software products, and/or configure hardware according to the approved system design Compile software to produce operational components, as needed Develop and/or implement database software Implement component or external system interfaces Implement applicable information system security controls Execute relevant aspects of draft System Conversion Plan, if applicable Update draft Test Plan with new or revised development testing scripts, as needed

Coordinate with IRM to update security test plans, as needed Document notes to support implementation planning and the production of draft operations, maintenance and user documentation Update configuration items in configuration management repository

4.4.4. Perform system development testing (WBS 4.4) This activity is conducted for each component and interface built or configured, to exercise all system functions and logical paths. For example, after a component or interface has been coded and compiled or configured without error, it is tested as a standalone entity. When all components and interfaces have been successfully developed and connected, additional tests are conducted to verify that the components and interfaces function together as one unified system. All software defects uncovered should be fixed and re-tested to verify acceptable performance for each component and interface. The ITS PM leads the project team and applicable technical stakeholders, as needed, through the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Install developed components in system development test environment Execute tests according to specifications in the draft Test Plan Produce Test Analysis Report to document development test results Correct defects and re-test using planned defect tracking methods Update Requirements Traceability Matrix or requirements tracking system, if applicable Update configuration items in configuration management repository Coordinate with IRM to validate that software code addresses security controls Interact with Section 508 Program Office for clarification in Accessibility testing or interpretation of results when necessary Output ­ Test Analysis Report for system development testing (see SA)

4.4.5. Plan for system integration and acceptance testing (WBS 4.5) This step can be conducted in parallel with system development and system development testing activities. As the project team develops and tests system components during the Development Phase, details emerge that will influence the testing approach for the Test Phase. The objective of this activity is to finalize all remaining test plans. The ITS PM works with assigned representatives from the ETT to conduct the following tasks: ˇ Review development notes and test reports as information evolves during the phase

4.4.6. Establish Test Phase environments (WBS 4.6) This step can be conducted in parallel with development and development testing activities, and after Test Phase plans are finalized. This step establishes physical environments according to detailed specifications and plans identified in the Test Plan. These environments consist of the services, connections, database and application servers, infrastructure and/or desktop computers required to support system integration and system acceptance testing. Project teams should note the increasing need at this stage to maintain consistency between engineering environments. The project team collaborates with ETT personnel, as appropriate, to conduct the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Install and configure environments for system integration testing and system acceptance testing Coordinate with ITS Data Management Services to configure database environments as planned Coordinate with IRM to verify security configuration of the Test Phase environments Update Test Plan with configuration information for the Test Phase environments, as needed Coordinate with SA to update and finalize build documentation

4.4.7. Plan for implementation (WBS 4.7) This step can be conducted in parallel with development and development testing activities. As the project team systematically develops and tests system components during the Development Phase, details become known which provide clarity to personnel who will eventually support installation. The objective of this activity is to document technical and logistical aspects of how to implement the system in the production environment. Additionally, the ITS PM should take preliminary steps to coordinate the system release within ITS. He or she should determine whether the project should be presented to the Engineering Review Group

(ERG) and whether Enterprise Configuration Control Board (ECCB) approval is needed. Throughout this activity, the project team should determine what adjustments to the implementation schedule may be needed to align with the ITS enterprise release schedule. The ITS PM leads the following tasks, consulting technical stakeholders from SA and TI, as needed: ˇ ˇ Review development notes and test reports as information evolves during the phase Submit preliminary Request for Change (RFC) following SA procedures, and receive assignment of a Release/Change Manager. Once the RFC is approved, no additional changes to the release schedule or scope should be made. Conduct an impact analysis that includes an assessment of human resources required and the cycle time to build, test and implement the system Interact with IRM representatives, as needed, to support C&A Package development Meet with ITS TS to determine O&M Phase application support model Coordinate with Business Unit to verify O&M Phase system administration procedures and transition plan Initiate draft Implementation Plan by documenting major implementation tasks, estimated release schedule, security requirements and implementation support requirements (e.g., hardware, software, facilities, materials and personnel). Note that the final implementation release schedule must be detailed down to the hour to fit within specific ITS release windows. Initiate draft Version Description Document to describe the primary components and configuration of the developed system

4.6.2. Finalized System Security Plan The System Security Plan (SSP) documents the information security controls in place to protect the system commensurate with its Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 security categorization. The project team works with ITS IRM personnel to produce this plan as its security controls are constructed. This plan then becomes the key document supporting the design of security control testing for the system as it moves through its certification phase (i.e., throughout SDLC Test and Implementation phases). This deliverable should be initiated in the Design Phase. It is updated and finalized during the Development Phase. This deliverable is also typically updated with the most current status of security controls whenever maintenance and enhancement releases are published during the SDLC Operations and Maintenance Phase. *Note: The SSP is unique in that an SDLC Deliverable Review does not need to be completed for this deliverable. IRM procedures dictate how to create, review, and maintain an SSP over its lifetime. 4.6.3. Development Phase Reports One report documents outcomes from the formal review conducted during this phase.

Requirements Review Process

1

Purpose of the Process
The Requirements Review is conducted to verify that requirements are complete according to SDLC guidelines. Requirements are evaluated to ensure that they are necessary and sufficient, that they are traceable to higher level requirements and defined functionality, and that they adequately balance stakeholder needs and constraints. The focus of the process is a review meeting conducted live before a panel of IT subject matter experts (SMEs) in order to uncover and address issues not sufficiently addressed in the system development project documentation up to that point.

1.1

Scope of the Process
The Requirements Review is defined as a formal SDLC Technical Review. Technical reviews are applicable to all system development projects at OCC, but can be tailored out of the project plan based on business needs and constraints, on the recommendation of the ITS Project Manager (ITS PM) with the approval of the PMO Program Manager (PMO PM). It is useful to note some additional characteristics of the Requirements Review process, and about SDLC technical reviews, in general: ˇ The duration of a technical review will generally be several hours. A technical review should be concise and targeted. The focus among participants should be on achieving consensus on the action items that are needed to address the technical issues and risks that were identified during the meeting. The Requirements Review process itself can be tailored by a project manager to suit business needs/constraints. Additional tailoring flexibilities include: ˇ Modifying what materials will serve as inputs to the process ˇ Modifying what content will be presented during a review ˇ Changing the activities that will be conducted before, during, and after the review meeting ˇ Changing the roles and assigning the participants for the review.

ˇ

1.2

Preconditions
A high degree of advance planning and coordination is required to attain quality results. The following conditions should be established for a project before any Technical Review is conducted: ˇ The ITS PM and PMO PM should complete SDLC tailoring in order to formally verify whether the Requirements Review will be included in the project's work plan.

Information Technology Services

Requirements Review Process

ˇ ˇ

ˇ

The ITS PM and PMO PM should include time and resource requirements for the full technical review process when estimating the project schedule. When the baseline work plan is complete, the ITS PM should have a kick-off meeting with stakeholders in ITS. The ITS PM should provide estimated dates for the Requirements Review if it is tailored into the plan. The ITS PM should work with the ITS Quality Management (ITS QM) department to communicate and/or train ITS personnel on how to provide effective feedback, before and during the technical review process.

Requirements Review Process

5.1

Plan Review (WBS 2.6.1)

This step ensures that the objectives and agenda for the Requirements Review meeting are established, the participants are identified and confirmed, and the inputs are prepared for distribution. This activity should be conducted well in advance (e.g., at least two weeks before the desired meeting date) to allow adequate time for preparation and scheduling. The review leader fills the primary role, performing the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Collect review inputs from development project team members and prepare artifacts to facilitate examination by reviewers Develop and document review objectives and procedures, including criteria for examining inputs and logging issues and risks Determine individual review participants and assign to review roles; if a conflict prevents an individual from participating, he or she should assign an alternative representative or proxy Schedule meeting and announce details to participants Distribute inputs and supporting artifacts to participants for examination.

5.2

Examine Inputs Prior to Review Meeting (WBS 2.6.2)

This step establishes a common understanding of the documented requirements among participants, and serves to capture issues and risks that reviewers want to discuss during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted with enough lead-time before the review to give reviewers adequate time to go through inputs and formulate topics for discussion. The following roles perform these tasks: ˇ ˇ Technical SMEs individually examine review inputs, record issues and risks based on their area of technical expertise, and return feedback to the review leader The review leader consolidates the examination results, using the Action Log template.

5.3

Create Review Materials (WBS 2.6.3)

This step accounts for the organization of material for the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the review meeting. The review leader performs these tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ Prepare review briefing by leveraging meeting objectives, inputs, and examination results from technical SMEs Meet to examine review materials and finalize meeting procedures with individual assigned to decision maker role Provide project team members with review materials, allowing them to address or develop responses to issues and risks raised by technical SMEs when they examined the inputs.

Requirements Review Process

5.4

Conduct Requirements Review (WBS 2.6.4)

This step ensures that requirements are presented to technical SMEs, in order to elicit concurrence with the requirements, system development test plan, or other attributes of the project. Participants perform the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Review leader and decision maker call meeting to order and present procedures plus meeting objectives Review leader coordinates the presentation of the requirements briefing Review leader presents artifacts from requirements definition and validation activities (e.g. disposable prototypes, use case documents, etc) Technical SMEs analyze requirements to determine whether they satisfy the objectives of higher level requirements; to ensure that they are complete, feasible, attainable, and verifiable; and to identify validation issues and expose unstated needs and customer requirements Technical SMEs provide comment and feedback, elaborating on existing issues and risks, as well as identifying additional ones Review participants collaborate to identify key requirements that have a strong influence on cost, schedule, functionality, risk, or performance Review leader and decision maker provide guidance, as necessary, while the meeting is in progress; any topics needing closure before the meeting ends are reviewed before the meeting is adjourned Review leader or an assigned recorder record meeting minutes Review leader or recorder populate the Action Log with issues and risks raised during the discussion Review leader obtains clarification from technical SMEs as needed.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

5.5

Determine Issue Resolution Plan (WBS 2.6.5)

This step establishes actionable plans for resolving requirements issues and risks that are recorded during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the meeting is adjourned. Participants collaborate on these tasks as follows: ˇ Review leader leads attendees through a review of items documented in the Action Log; for each item classified as a risk (meaning it is an event that has not yet occurred), the group will prioritize each risk by impact and probability; resolution actions, action owners, and target completion dates should be assigned to each line item Decision maker provides concurrence ­ and authority if needed ­ for risk categorization/prioritization and resolution planning If necessary, review leader postpones resolution planning for any issues or risks on which the audience concurs more information is required from members of staff not present; relevant follow-up actions must be noted

If necessary, review leader identifies any issues or risks needing to be deferred to senior management for resolution Review leader or recorder documents the discussion by populating the Action Log and Review Report Review leader determines the conclusion of the meeting and cedes the floor to the decision maker Decision maker formally closes the meeting by reviewing the Review Report with attendees, soliciting concurrence on the final disposition of the outcome, and signing the report.

5.6

Distribute Review Results (WBS 2.6.6)

This step accounts for the distribution of meeting outputs to project stakeholders. It ensures there is a common understanding of action items and key milestones needed to complete Requirements Definition Phase activities, in order to proceed into the next life cycle phase, Design. This activity should be conducted after the review meeting is adjourned. Note that it is the responsibility of the review leader, working with the project manager(s) as necessary, to track all action items on the completed Action Log through to completion after the review process concludes. The review leader, with the assistance of recorder, completes the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Finalizes the meeting minutes and Action Log Distributes review outputs and verifies receipt by all participants.

Critical Design Review Process

1

Purpose of the Process
The Critical Design Review (CDR) is a formal review that evaluates the technical adequacy of the architecture and design of a system under development. The CDR is conducted live before a panel of IT subject matter experts (SMEs) who determine whether the system design can be implemented on the selected platform, accounts for all functional and technical requirements, and is consistent with the OCC Enterprise Architecture (EA).

1.1

Scope of the Process
The Critical Design Review is defined as a formal SDLC Technical Review. Technical reviews are applicable to all system development projects at OCC, but it can be tailored out of the project plan based on business needs and constraints, on the recommendation of the ITS Project Manager (ITS PM) with the approval of the PMO Program Manager (PMO PM). It is useful to note some additional characteristics of the CDR process, and about SDLC technical reviews, in general: ˇ The duration of a technical review will generally be several hours (two hours is ideal). A technical review should be concise and targeted. The focus among participants should be on achieving consensus on the action items that are needed to address the technical issues and risks that were identified during the meeting. The CDR process itself can be tailored by a project manager to suit business needs/constraints. Additional tailoring flexibilities include: ˇ Modifying what materials will serve as inputs to the process ˇ Modifying what content will be presented during a review ˇ Changing the activities that will be conducted before, during, and after the review meeting ˇ Changing the roles and assigning the participants for the review The CDR can be structured as a prototype demonstration, if the project approach involves iterative refinement of the design through a working prototype.

ˇ

ˇ

1.2

Key Definitions
ˇ Design Risk: A condition wherein the system design will fail to adequately address a requirement from a technical perspective. All design risks identified through the CDR process must be resolved, and any rework may be formally reviewed at the discretion of the Review Leader or ITS PM of the system under review.

1.3

Preconditions
A high degree of advance planning and coordination is required to attain quality results. The following conditions should be established for a project before the CDR is conducted: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The ITS PM and PMO PM should complete SDLC tailoring in order to formally verify whether the CDR will be included in the project's work plan. The ITS PM and PMO PM should include time and resource requirements for the full CDR process when estimating the project schedule. When the baseline work plan is complete, the ITS PM should have a kick-off meeting with stakeholders in ITS. The ITS PM should provide estimated dates for the CDR if it is tailored into the plan. The ITS PM should work with the ITS Quality Management (ITS QM) department to communicate and/or train ITS personnel on how to provide effective feedback, before and during the technical review process.

Activities
The CDR process consists of three general stages, with activities conducted before, during, and after the review. This section provides detail about each activity including a brief description of its purpose, a summary of roles, a list of tasks, and references to artifacts supporting the activity.

5.1

Plan Review (WBS 3.6.1)

This step ensures that the objectives and agenda for the CDR meeting are established, the participants are identified and confirmed, and the inputs are prepared for distribution. This activity should be conducted well in advance (e.g. at least two weeks before the desired meeting date) to allow adequate time for preparation and scheduling. The review leader fills the primary role, performing the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Collect CDR inputs from development project team members and prepare artifacts to facilitate examination by reviewers Develop and document CDR objectives and review procedures, including criteria for examining inputs and logging design issues and risks Determine individual review participants and assign to CDR roles; if a conflict prevents an individual from participating, he or she should assign an alternative representative or proxy Schedule meeting and announce details to participants Distribute CDR inputs and supporting artifacts to participants for examination.

5.2

Examine Inputs Prior to Review Meeting (WBS 3.6.2)

This step establishes a common understanding of the system design among participants, and serves to document issues and risks that reviewers want to discuss during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted with enough lead-time before the review to give reviewers adequate time to go through inputs and formulate topics for discussion. The following roles perform these tasks: ˇ ˇ Technical SMEs individually examine CDR inputs, record issues and risks based on their area of technical expertise, and return feedback to the review leader The review leader consolidates the examination results, using the Action Log template.

5.3

Create Review Materials (WBS 3.6.3)

This step accounts for the organization of material for the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the review meeting. The review leader performs these tasks:

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Prepare CDR briefing by leveraging meeting objectives, CDR inputs, and examination results from technical SMEs Meet to examine review materials and finalize meeting procedures with individual assigned to decision maker role Provide project team members with review materials, allowing them to address or develop responses to issues and risks raised by technical SMEs when they examined the inputs.

5.4

Conduct Critical Design Review (WBS 3.6.4)

This step ensures that system design details are presented to technical SMEs, in order to elicit issues and risks with the design, development plan, or other attributes of the project. Participants perform the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Review leader and decision maker call meeting to order and present procedures plus meeting objectives Review leader coordinates the presentation of the system design briefing, highlighting topics raised by technical SMEs during pre-examination of inputs Technical SMEs provide comment and feedback, elaborating on existing issues and risks, as well as identifying additional ones Review leader and decision maker provide guidance, as necessary, while the meeting is in progress; any topics needing closure before the meeting ends are reviewed before the meeting is adjourned Review leader or an assigned recorder records meeting minutes Review leader or recorder populates the Action Log with issues and risks raised during the discussion Review leader obtains clarification from technical SMEs as needed.

5.5

Determine Issue Resolution Plan (WBS 3.6.5)

This step establishes actionable plans for resolving system design issues and risks that are recorded during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the meeting is adjourned. Participants collaborate on these tasks as follows: ˇ Review leader leads attendees through a review of items documented in the Action Log; for each item classified as a design risk (meaning it is an event that has not yet occurred), the group will prioritize each risk by impact and probability; resolution actions, action owners, and target completion dates should be assigned to each line item Review leader references "significant design risk" criteria in order to help determine if any issues qualify* Decision maker provides concurrence ­ and authority if needed ­ for risk categorization/prioritization and resolution planning

If necessary, review leader postpones resolution planning for any issues or risks on which the audience concurs more information is required from members of staff not present; relevant follow-up actions must be noted If necessary, review leader identifies any issues or risks needing to be deferred to senior management for resolution Review leader or recorder documents the discussion by populating the Action Log and CDR Report Review leader determines the conclusion of the meeting and cedes the floor to the decision maker Decision maker formally closes the meeting by reviewing the CDR Report with attendees, soliciting concurrence on the final disposition of the outcome, and signing the report.

* Note: If any risks raised pose a "significant design risk," then the decision maker can choose to recommend that the project team halt its progress in order to fix the design flaws and re-validate the design before proceeding. This condition requires the project team to redo the CDR process, once the design adjustments have been made and documented.

Distribute Review Results (WBS 3.6.6)

This step accounts for the distribution of meeting outputs to project stakeholders. It ensures there is a common understanding of action items and key milestones needed to conclude Design Phase activities, in order to proceed into the next life cycle phase, Development. This activity should be conducted after the review meeting is adjourned. Note that it is the responsibility of the review leader, working with the project manager(s) as necessary, to track all action items on the completed Action Log through to completion after the CDR process concludes. The review leader, with the assistance of recorder, completes the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Finalizes the meeting minutes and Action Log Distributes review outputs and verifies receipt by all participants.

Release Readiness Review Process

1

Purpose of the Process
The Release Readiness Review (RRR), also referred to as "Go/No Go," ensures that the system is ready for deployment. Specifically, it verifies that the system has passed all testing, implementation planning is adequate, and deployment risks are within an acceptable range. The focus of the process is a review meeting conducted live before a panel of IT subject matter experts (SME) in order to uncover and address issues not sufficiently addressed in the systems development project documentation up to that point. The RRR must take place before a release can be moved to production.

1.1

Scope of the Process
The RRR is defined as a formal SDLC Technical Review. Technical Reviews are applicable to all system development projects at OCC, but can be tailored out of the project plan based on business needs and constraints, on the recommendation of the ITS Project Manager (ITS PM) with the approval of the PMO Program Manager (PMO PM) and ITS Solutions Assurance (SA). It is useful to note some additional characteristics of the RRR process, and about SDLC technical reviews, in general: ˇ While ITS SA has published detailed procedures for the RRR milestone, the SDLC program provides this document as a complement to SA governance. The SDLC view is an end-to-end process description that ties together procedures from multiple IT disciplines that intersect at the RRR milestone. There are three stages to a Technical Review process ­ planning the review, conducting the review meeting, and concluding the review. While the duration of the technical review meeting may be an hour or more, the end-to-end process may take a week or more to complete successfully with a high level of quality. A Technical Review should be concise and targeted. The focus among participants should be on achieving consensus on the action items that are needed to address the technical issues and risks that were identified during the meeting. The RRR process itself can be tailored to some degree by a project manager to suit business needs/constraints. However, because of process efficiency goals within SA, any tailoring to the RRR meeting must be verified and agreed to with SA representatives, in advance. If agreed to, additional tailoring flexibilities include: ˇ Modifying what materials will serve as inputs to the process ˇ Modifying what content will be presented during a review ˇ Changing the activities that will be conducted before, during, and after the review meeting ˇ Changing the roles and assigning the participants for the review.

1.2

Preconditions
A high degree of advance planning and coordination is required to attain quality results. The following conditions should be established for a project before any Technical Review is conducted: ˇ ˇ Before the SDLC Planning phase, the ITS PM and PMO PM should complete SDLC tailoring in order to formally verify whether the RRR will be included in the project's work plan. When conducting SDLC tailoring as well as when updating project plans, the ITS PM and PMO PM should include time and resource requirements for the full technical review process when estimating the project schedule. When the baseline work plan is complete, the ITS PM should have a kick-off meeting with stakeholders in ITS. The ITS PM should provide estimated dates for the RRR if it is tailored into the plan. The ITS PM should work with the ITS Quality Management (ITS QM) department to communicate and/or train ITS personnel on how to provide effective feedback, before and during the technical review process.

Comptroller of the Currency

SDLC Manual 3.1.1

Release Readiness Review Process

each activity in the RRR process including a brief description of its purpose, a summary of roles, a list of tasks, and references to artifacts supporting the activity.

5.1

Plan Review (WBS 5.5.1)

This step ensures that the process entry criteria have been met, objectives and agenda for the RRR meeting are established, the participants are identified and confirmed, and the inputs are prepared for distribution. This activity should be conducted well in advance (e.g., at least two weeks before the desired meeting date) to allow adequate time for preparation and scheduling. The review leader fills the primary role, performing the following tasks: ˇ Confirm that testing objectives have been met and all required parties are ready to review results for acceptance; if any outstanding test problem reports are deemed unacceptable, cancel or postpone the RRR until fixes are in place and tested with the desired results If applicable, confirm that system certification and accreditation is complete, and that a signed "Authority to Operate" (ATO) decision is on file with IRM Collect review inputs from development and test team members, and prepare artifacts to facilitate examination by reviewers Develop and document review objectives and procedures, including criteria for examining inputs and logging issues and risks Determine individual review participants and assign to review roles; if a conflict prevents an individual from participating, he or she should assign an alternative representative or proxy Schedule meeting and announce details to participants Distribute inputs and supporting artifacts to participants for examination.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

5.2

Examine Inputs Prior to Review Meeting (WBS 5.5.2)

This step establishes a common understanding of the system test results and implementation plan among participants, and serves to capture issues and risks that reviewers will discuss during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted with enough lead-time before the review to give reviewers adequate time to go through inputs and formulate topics for discussion. The following roles perform these tasks: ˇ ˇ Technical SMEs individually examine review inputs, record issues and risks based on their area of technical expertise, and return feedback to the review leader The review leader consolidates the examination results, using the Action Log template if necessary.

SDLC Manual 3.1.1

Release Readiness Review Process

5.3

Create Review Materials (WBS 5.5.3)

This step accounts for the organization of material for the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the review meeting. The review leader performs these tasks: ˇ ˇ Populate RRR Checklist with meeting information, list of reviewers, list of inputs provided to reviewers, and list of review objectives Prepare review package to include RRR Checklist, a Review Action Log highlighting any issues raised by technical SMEs when examining review inputs, and any additional material needed to facilitate discussion of test results and implementation plan Meet to examine review materials and finalize meeting procedures with individual assigned to decision maker role Provide project team members with review materials, allowing them to address or develop responses to issues and risks raised by technical SMEs when they examined the inputs.

ˇ ˇ

5.4

Conduct Release Readiness Review (WBS 5.5.4)

This step ensures that review materials are presented to technical SMEs, in order to elicit concurrence with test results, implementation plan, or other attributes of the project. See SA for detailed guidance on conducting RRR meetings. Participants perform the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ Review leader and decision maker call meeting to order and present procedures plus meeting objectives Review leader coordinates the presentation of the review package Technical SMEs analyze review materials to assess whether testing was successful and reflective of the system's performance in the production environment; to determine the adequacy of implementation plan and system conversion procedures; and to concur that the system has met security requirements. Technical SMEs provide comment and feedback, elaborating on existing issues and risks, as well as identifying additional ones Review leader and decision maker provide guidance, as necessary, while the meeting is in progress; any topics needing closure before the meeting ends are reviewed before the meeting is adjourned Review leader or an assigned recorder record meeting minutes Review leader or recorder populate the Action Log with issues and risks raised during the discussion Review leader obtains clarification from technical SMEs as needed.

5.5

Determine Issue Resolution Plan (WBS 5.5.5)

This step establishes actionable plans for resolving issues and risks that are recorded during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the meeting is adjourned. Participants collaborate on these tasks as follows: ˇ Review leader leads attendees through a review of items documented in the Action Log, including any added during the course of the meeting; for each item classified as a risk (meaning it is an event that has not yet occurred), the group will prioritize each risk by impact and probability; resolution actions, action owners, and target completion dates should be assigned to each line item Decision Maker provides concurrence ­ and authority if needed ­ for risk categorization/prioritization and resolution planning If necessary, review leader postpones resolution planning for any issues or risks on which the audience concurs more information is required from members of staff not present; relevant follow-up actions must be noted If necessary, review leader identifies any issues or risks needing to be deferred to senior management for resolution Review leader or recorder documents the discussion by populating the Action Log and RRR Checklist Review leader determines the conclusion of the meeting and cedes the floor to the decision maker Decision maker formally closes the meeting by reviewing the RRR Checklist with attendees, soliciting concurrence on the final disposition of the outcome (i.e., "Go/No Go" decision), and signing the RRR Checklist.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

5.6

Distribute Review Results (WBS 5.5.6)

This step accounts for the distribution of meeting outputs to project stakeholders. It ensures there is a common understanding of action items and key milestones needed to complete Test Phase activities, in order to proceed into the next life cycle phase, Implementation. This activity should be conducted after the review meeting is adjourned. Note that it is the responsibility of the review leader, working with the project manager(s) as necessary, to track all action items on the completed Action Log through to completion after the review process concludes. The review leader, with the assistance of recorder, completes the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Finalize the meeting minutes and Action Log Distribute review outputs and verify receipt by all participants.

Attachment A--Quality Definitions
Term Quality Management Definition Quality Management is the OCC umbrella program that encompasses quality assurance (QA), independent verification and validation (IV&V), and IT policies, standards, and procedures. QA refers to the processes used to verify that deliverables are of acceptable quality and that they meet the completeness and correctness criteria established. QA does not refer to specific deliverables.

Quality Assurance

 The preparation of a QA plan for a project is part of QA.  The development of standards is part of QA.  The execution of a "Quality Event" is part of QA.
Quality Materials The artifacts used within OCC to assist the project manager in improving quality in the project (e.g., templates, standards, checklists, etc.). These materials are used in "Quality Events." The activities undertaken using "Quality Materials" to validate the quality of the project. Examples of quality events: Expert Review Review of a deliverable by a person who is considered an expert in the area. For example, a review of a data model by a senior DBA. The person may not currently hold a position (e.g., currently be a DBA) but has expert knowledge in the area. This type of review is good when the focus is on accuracy of content rather than of structure. Review of deliverables by one's peers. Peer reviews are better suited where the emphasis is on structure rather than content. A peer review will focus on ensuring the deliverable is well designed and developed. Neither an "Expert Review" nor a "Peer Review" is exclusively focused on content or structure. They each however, have different emphasis. A walk-through is a useful technique to validate both the content and structure of a deliverable. Material should be circulated in advance. A formal inspection is a review of a deliverable by an inspector who would typically be external to the project team. The inspector captures statistics on suspected defects. It is a useful technique for use with documentation. An independent examination of a work product or process to determine compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other preestablished criteria. Process audits and configuration audits are two types of audits. Review of a business process to ensure all necessary

CM-PROC-09 Change Request Procedure Purpose The purpose of this procedure is to provide a consistent and repeatable process for a Request for Change (RFC) to be entered, maintained, tracked, approved, and prioritized, and updated until completion, Scheduling the RFC to be reviewed by the Engineering Review Group (ERG), obtaining appropriate approval, and tracking the RFC through completion of the RFC lifecycle. Procedure Anyone may request a proposed change. Submission of a request for change (RFC) is limited to members of the ITS team that have access to the Enterprise Change Control System (ECCS). Change Management (CM) tracks and controls submitted RFCs using a single CM tracking tool (Rational Clear Quest ECCS). An impact analysis is completed and attached to the actual Change Request before it is presented to the ERG for review. The ERG reviews the RFC to determine impact and provides a recommendation for disposition that is forwarded to the Enterprise Change Control Board (ECCB), or other approval authority as defined in the process for approval if necessary. CM uses the CM tracking tool to assign, prioritize, monitor, and report the status of RFCs. The Change Control Procedure also ensures adherence to Change Management/Release Management Process Flow. ERG convenes with the authority to: ˇ ˇ ˇ Review Impact Assessments and the Technical Aspects of an RFC Provides Guidance as to the type of CI(s) being Changed Provides consensus as to disposition of an RFC (i.e., deferred for lack of information, or sent the ECCB, or the Project Manager for approval.) Review Approve/disapprove Categorize changes Prioritize changes

ECCB convenes with the authority to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

As a RFC progresses through Change Management/Release Management, and SDLC process flow, its status is tracked and updated. CM updates the RFC status with the appropriate status each time the RFC advances to the next step in the life cycle. CM also uses this information to prepare the Forward Schedule of Change (FSC), and weekly release reports.

RFC STATUS TYPE Submitted SA Review

DESCRIPTION Submitted RFC, initial change information being filled out by Change Submitter. RFC analysis being performed by SA (Change Manager) to ensure completeness and accuracy of RFC. Non Enterprise RFCs waiting for review by submitter manager, and/or software control board (SCCB). Enterprise RFCs waiting for review by the Engineering Review Group (ERG). Enterprise RFCs that have been reviewed by the ERG waiting for ECCB approval. The ECCB, SCCB, or Submitter Manager agrees on the classification (type) and prioritization of the change request. The RFC is placed on the Forward Schedule of Change (FSC) and handed off to Release Management for coordination and implementation. The RFC found to be impractical or the solution is not technically sound. The Change Submitter is informed of the decision and the rationale. The Change Submitter may resubmit the change request at a later date. The RFC requires further analysis or more information is needed to make an informed decision. The RFC is marked as deferred until the requirements for more information and analysis are satisfied. The SA change manager will monitor the RFC to ensure the contingencies are satisfied and the change is re-presented for approval. The approval may be facilitated through email or the RFC may be placed on the agenda for a future ECCB meeting. An RFC may be marked as canceled if a duplicate change is already in progress or the need for the change is overcome by other events

Initiating Release Activities

All RFCs that have received approval and have been handed off the Release Management for coordination and implementation. RFCs that have utilized the Enterprise Test Lab (ETL) for testing and test plans are under review. ETL testing in progress ETT review of all testing results All RFC undergoing release review. Release Reviews should occur no later than 2 business days before schedule release. If a no-go decision is made the RFC will be documented and returned to Initiating Release Activities RFCs that have received a GO decision during the RRR and are waiting for deployment RFCs that have been implemented successfully. RFCs that implementation is unsuccessful and whose end state did not change as a result of the backout plan being initiated RFCs waiting a post implementation review (PIR). All Major, and Emergency RFCs require a PIR before the RFC can be closed. Any RFC in which the implementation was unsuccessful also requires a PIR before it can be closed or marked as failed. RFC which was unsuccessful or did not achieve the desired end results of the change, and requiring the backout plan being implemented returning the CI to the pervious baseline. RFCs that were implemented successfully and all required documentation and artifacts have been completed and attached to the RFC

Type Of Change Proposed Standard

Description Initial RFC requesting consideration for approval of a standard change ­ requires documented procedures for implementation that can be followed ever time change is implemented. A standard change is a change that follows an established path (procedure), is relatively common, and is the pre-approved solution to a specific set of requirements.

Standard

Major

A major change is a complex change to a system, system component, application, database structure, or service that has broad impact with substantial resource and risk implications. Major changes are assigned high priority and should be presented to the ECCB as projects with an approved strategy and detailed project plan A minor change is a change to a system, system component, application, database structure, or service that poses low risk and does not require significant funding or resources to implement. Urgent or High priority changes that address actual or imminent degradation or loss of service. Emergency changes are considered when there is no interim workaround to handle bugs or crises. All Emergency change requests must include written justification in the description section of the RFC; the circumstances warranting emergency changes will be evaluated by the ECCB.

Minor

Emergency

1.3.

Change Submitter will identify the priority of the change Priority Urgent Description Condition is causing loss of service or severe usability problems to a significant number of users or a mission critical system. Urgent business need dictates the change. Infrastructure security is

7

compromised and immediate action is required. An Urgent priority is used to restore service of a production incident, with a temporary or permanent fix and is implemented immediately. The Release Coordinator is notified of the emergency and initial approval occurs via email to the Release Mgmt Update mailbox from the manager-level person responsible for the application or service affected and is included in the RFC. An Emergency RFC with an Urgent priority can be opened after the change is implemented, however, the RFC must o Be opened within 1 business day following implementation o Include appropriate documentation (approvals, CI's changed, attachments, etc.) provided Be marked `completed' within one business day following implementation High Condition severely affecting an application or impacting a significant number of users. The enterprise infrastructure is unstable or the work around is inefficient and system/application performance is compromised. The change should be given high priority for building, testing, and implementation resources. An Emergency RFC with a priority of High is used when implementation of a change is required before the next regularly scheduled ECCB meeting. Other change types (Standard, Major, Minor) may also have a priority of High, but are subject to the normal review and approval cycle. Regardless of the change type, approval from the ECCB is required prior to implementing the change. All approvals must be obtained prior to the start of implementation, or the change is considered unauthorized. Electronic approval must be documented in the change record before the change is implemented. Medium The change causes no severe impact but it cannot be deferred until the next scheduled release or upgrade. An efficient work around is available. The problem or condition is a rare occurrence. The change should

8

be allocated medium priority for resources.

Low

The change is justified and necessary but it can wait until the next scheduled release or upgrade. Not a priority for building, testing, and implementation resources

If Change Submitter determines the Change is an Emergency change with Urgent priority. 1.4.1. The change submitter will obtain written approval to implement the change from their manager. 1.4.2. Implement the change 1.4.3. Open an RFC within 24 hours of implementation following the normal RFC creation process

1.5. 1.6. 1.7. 1.8. 1.9.

Change Submitter will provide a title for the RFC ECCS will automatically assign a Submitted Date. Change Submitter will fill out the Submitter Name, Submitter Phone Number, Manager Name, Managers Phone Number and off Hours Phone Number. Change submitter will refer to ASI to identify the Change Manager. Change Submitter will identify the Primary Functional Area: Infrastructure, or Application depending on type of change being requested.

1.10. Change Submitter will provide a full description of the change being requested along with identifying the CI(s) being requested for change. Refer to Identify the Configuration Items and Placing Them Under CM Control ­ CM-Proc-04 v1.0. 1.11. Change Submitter will provide a description of the business value of making the change 1.12. 1.13. 1.14. 1.15. Change Submitter will identify the business unit being affected by the change. Change Submitter will identify if the change will require ASI to be updated. Change Submitter will identify if a server reboot is required. Change Submitter will identify for an SMS push is required.

1.16. Change Submitter will complete an Impact Assessment identifying all impact information (to include a list of other CI(s) that may be affected, what will be affected, user group's impacted, and possible down time). The Change Manager will assist the submitter in filling out the Impact Assessment. Refer to Identify the Configuration Items and Placing Them Under CM Control ­ CM-Proc-04 v1.0. 1.17.

1.19. Change Submitter will change the state of the RFC to SA Review. At this time, the CM Tracking tool will notify Solutions Assurance of a new RFC for review. 2. SA Analysis 2.1. 2.2. CM Tracking tool will notify Solutions Assurance and ETT (Enterprise Test Team) of a new RFC for review via e-mail. Change Manager identifies the Release Type: 2.2.1. A release type of Scheduled is assigned to Changes that are planned to take place during one of the two monthly release weekends posted on the release calendar. 2.2.2. A Release type of Unscheduled is assigned to Changes taking place any other time. All Emergency changes by definition will be unscheduled. 2.3. ETT will assign an ETT POC and identify the POC in the RFC. If ETT services will be used for testing a Test Tailoring Work Sheet (TTW) will be completed and attached to the RFC. The Change Manager will review the RFC and Impact Assessment for completeness and accuracy. If any additional information is required the Change Manager will work with the Change Submitter to gather the required information. If it is determined that the change is being implemented in a phased approach, the change manager will review the Impact Assessment to determine the following: 2.5.1. If the same work is being performed on different CI's in multiple release windows then the change can be recorded in a single RFC. 2.5.2. If different work is performed in multiple release windows then a separate RFC will be required for the work being performed during each release window. 2.6. The Change Manager will verify and confirm the priority, type of change and the type of CI(s) being changed. Depending on type of CI and type of change the following 4 paths will be taken: 2.6.1.1. Change Manager will review the RFC, check the ECCS database and verify there is an existing approved proposed standard matching the description of the change. 2.6.1.2. If Standard Change requested has an ECCB approved proposed standard , the Change Manager will update the RFC approved by field with "Approved by ECCB" and attach the approved proposed standard in the parent child relationship field. If change has not received ECCB pre approval proceed to 2.6.4) Changes Requiring ERG Review. 2.6.1.3. Fill in the CBB approval date. 2.6.1.4.

ensure that the proposed change meets the definition of an Emergency Change. The Change Manager will also ensure that a written justification in the description section of the RFC is provided. 2.6.4.2. The Change Manager will initiate an E-mail to the voting members of ECCB requesting a review and approval of the Emergency Change. The Change Manager will include the RFC, Impact Assessment, and a description of the change in the E-mail. 2.6.4.3. Voting members of the ECCB will review and provide reply to the Emergency Change Notification with a written approval or disapproval of the change. 2.6.4.4. Upon receiving written replies with approval status from the voting members of the ECCB, the change manager will ensure that 3 of the 4 votes approve the change before proceeding. All replies from the ECCB voting members will be attached to the RFC. 2.6.4.5. If Emergency Change requested has received ECCB approval from 3 of the 4 voting members of the ECCB, the Change Manager will update the RFC approved by field with "Approved by ECCB" Fill in the CBB approval date. 2.6.4.6.

that all changes are reviewed by ERG in a timely manner to ensure ECCB review can be completed within 30 days of the scheduled maintenance window. 2.6.5.6. Change Manager will review all candidates for ERG review and communicate with Change submitters to verify if they are ready to present their change to the ERG. If change is ready for presentation it will be included on the ERG schedule. If change is not ready for presentation change will remain in same state for consideration for the following weeks ERG review. 2.6.5.7. Change Manager will compile the ERG schedule every Wednesday and provide the schedule to all members of the ERG, Change Submitters, and Stakeholders. 2.6.5.8. Change Manager will facilitate the ERG meeting and capture all comments regarding the change in the ERG comments field in the ERG. If ERG recommends the change to be forwarded to the ECCB for review the Change Manager will ensure the security scan required, and firewall changes needed fields are completed. Change the state of the RFC to ECCB Review. The ECCB review date will be set for the next scheduled ECCB review date. If more information is required by the ERG the change will be set to Deferred and the Change Control Tool will automatically change the state of the RFC to SA Review. 2.6.5.9. 2.6.5.10. 2.6.5.11. 3.1.

3. Review & Approval Every Friday the Change Manager will compile a schedule of all changes that have been reviewed by the ERG that are waiting for ECCB approval. The schedule will be sent to the ECCB members as well as to the Change Submitters. All changes scheduled for the ECCB will be reviewed. The Change Manager will capture minutes from the ECCB. The ECCB will vote on each change with a vote of "Approved, Deferred, or Canceled" 3.2.1. If the proposed change is canceled by the ECCB the Change Manager will update the RFC Status field to "Canceled" so the proposed change will be closed. 3.2.2. It the proposed change is deferred by the ECCB the Change Manager will update the RFC Status field to "Deferred" and the Change Control Tool will set the state of the change to SA Review. The Change Manager will assist the Change Submitter in attainting the information requested by the ECCB. 3.2.3. If the ERG determines the change being requested is a change to a Non-Enterprise CI, the Change Manager will change the RFC state to Project Level Review. The Non-Enterprise Change Knowledge Base will be updated with the change information, and proceed back to step 2 E 2) d above. 3.2.4. If the proposed change is approved by the ECCB the Change Manager will update 13

the RFC Approved by field to "ECCB" and ensure the approved "Scheduled Start Date and End Date and Times are recorded, as well as ensure the Release Type is set to "Scheduled or Unscheduled" depending on the scheduled date of change. 3.2.5. The Change Manager will change the state of the RFC to Approved 3.3. Once a Change is approved by the ECCB it will be considered a baseline. If there are any additions to the work being performed or if the date is being changed the RFC will be brought to the ECCB for reconsideration. Record Change in FSC. Refer to Procedure Performing Release Management. (Link will be updated once Procedure is signed and posted in the documentation library). Upon completion of Release Implementation the Change submitter will ensure that the Implementation of the release was successful. If validation is successful the Change submitter will change the state of the RFC to Validation Successful which will move the RFC to a completed state. If change was unsuccessful the Change Submitter will change the RFC state to Validation unsuccessful which will move the RFC to a Back out plan initiated state. Change Submitter will enter an implementation start time and completion time. It the change type is minor or standard the change manager will verify the change was successful and change the RFC state to closed All major, emergency, and any change that required the back out plan being implemented will be scheduled for a Post Implementation Review (PIR). A PIR will be scheduled no sooner then two weeks after the completion date of the RFC. All RFCs that are unsuccessful resulting in the backout plan being initiated will be changed to a state of Failed by the Change Manager. All other RFCs will be changed to a state of closed by the Change Manager. FSC will be updated.

Enhancement and Maintenance Definitions
Enhancements (Non-Maintenance) An enhancement effort shall be one categorized as possessing one of the following characteristics: 1. New system development in support of business functions that are not currently augmented with information technology 2. Functional changes or modifications to existing systems that are outside the scope of the of the original business case. ˇ Include major changes to existing design patterns and application solution framework to implement new customer requirements that are not traceable to the project's current functional or technical requirements baseline. Could include adding a new functional module or integrating a new hardware/software component to the current architecture.

ˇ

3. Significant reengineering/modernization of an existing system to improve capability or performance through the implementation of new system architecture components, which could result in risks to the organization due to the introduction of new/unproven technologies or due to the magnitude of the planned modifications themselves. ˇ ˇ Planned replacement of multiple system components system due to hardware and/or software obsolescence. Planned replacement of the system based on an operational analysis determination of its inability to meet current business needs.

Maintenance Categories

Description Change to a system, after delivery, to correct identified defects that is related to an existing requirement or function allocated to the production baseline. Includes modifications to systems or programs that fix application problems caused by design, logic, or coding errors. Change to a system, after delivery, to keep it functioning properly in a changed or changing system, technical or business environments. Includes minor enhancements to existing design patterns and the existing application solution framework to keep the system viable in production to meet customer requirements.

Corrective Maintenance

Adaptive Maintenance

Also includes modifications mandated in response to laws or regulations that govern OCC programs and support for changing business requirements within scope of the original business case. These modifications result in hardware or software changes and/or updates to the system within OCC's technical architecture that are approved by the Enterprise Architecture Program.

                                                             Non-Disclosure Agreement
                                                            Contract # _______________


I, ________________________________________, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted conditional
access to certain United States Government documents or material containing sensitive but unclassified information.

I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions:

1.    By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence
and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

2.    As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information, the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or
modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are
entitled under Title 5 U.S.C. 552a, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of
Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.

3.    I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of (Contract #     ). This
approval will permit me conditional access to certain information.  This Agreement will not allow me access to materials which the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency has predetermined, in its sole discretion, are inappropriate for disclosure pursuant to this Agreement.  This may
include sensitive but unclassified information provided to Treasury by other agencies of the United States Government.

4.    I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information, which is provided to me pursuant to this Agreement to anyone, unless I
have been advised in writing by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that the individual is authorized to receive it.  Should I desire
to make use of any sensitive but unclassified information, I will do so in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Agreement. I will submit to the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for security review, prior to any submission for publication, any book, article, column or other
written work for general publication that is based upon any knowledge I obtained during the course of my work on this (Contract #   ) in order
for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed.


5.    I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result
from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.


6.    If I am permitted, at the sole discretion of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to review any official documents containing
sensitive but unclassified information, such review will be conducted at a secure facility or under circumstances, which will maintain the
security protection of such material.  I will not be permitted to and will not make any copies of documents or parts of documents to which
conditional access is granted to me.

7.    If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified
information could compromise the security of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

8.    If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to
sensitive but unclassified information.  This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency information, both classified and sensitive but unclassified information in the future. If I violate the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief. The willful disclosure of information to
which I have agreed therein not to divulge may constitute a criminal offence.

9.    Unless and until I am provided a written release by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency from this Agreement or any portions of
it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the
conclusion of my work on the assigned (Contract #          ), and at all times thereafter.

10.   Each provision of this Agreement is severable.  If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.


11.   I understand that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement.

12.   By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law
evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive but unclassified
information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.

   13. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights or
       liabilities created by Executive Order 12356; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section
       1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by
       members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing
       disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982
       (50 U.S.C. 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); Sections 7213, 7213A, and 7431 of Title
       26, United States Code (governing disclosures of Federal tax returns and return information); and the statutes which protect against
       disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and
       Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Section 783 (b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights,
       sanctions and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling.

   14.  Nature of work to be performed and associated security/disclosure issues: (As outlined in the contract)

   15. All confidential information will be accounted for upon receipt and properly stored before, during, and after processing.  In addition,

14

CC-10-HQ-R-0050 Lotus Notes Support Services

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.

G.5. 52.232-7 PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABORHOUR CONTRACTS (AUG 2005)

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of invoices or vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer: (a) Hourly rate. (1) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor hours performed. The rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting Officer or designee. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers by evidence of actual payment and by individual daily job timecards, or other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer. Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject to the terms of (e) below, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer. (2) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a), but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (f) of this clause. (3) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the

15

CC-10-HQ-R-0050 Lotus Notes Support Services

premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (b) Materials and subcontracts. (1) The Contracting Officer will determine allowable costs of direct materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract. Direct materials, as used in this clause, are those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product. (2) The Contractor may include reasonable and allocable material handling costs in the charge for material to the extent they are clearly excluded from the hourly rate. Material handling costs are comprised of indirect costs, including, when appropriate, general and administrative expense allocated to direct materials in accordance with the Contractor's usual accounting practices consistent with Subpart 31.2 of the FAR. (3) The Government will reimburse the Contractor for supplies and services purchased directly for the contract when the Contractor-(i) Has made payments of cash, checks, or other forms of payment for these purchased supplies or services; or Will make these payments determined due-(A) In accordance with the terms and conditions of a subcontract or invoice; and (B) Ordinarily within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government. (4) (i) The Government will reimburse the Contractor for costs of subcontracts that are authorized under the subcontracts clause of this contract, provided that the costs are consistent with paragraph (b)(5) of this clause. (ii) The Government will limit reimbursable costs in connection with subcontracts to the amounts paid for supplies and services purchased directly for the contract when the Contractor has made or will make payments determined due of cash, checks, or other forms of payment to the subcontractor-(A) In accordance with the terms and conditions of a subcontract or invoice; and

(ii)

16

CC-10-HQ-R-0050 Lotus Notes Support Services

(B) Ordinarily within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government. (iii) The Government will not reimburse the Contractor for any costs arising from the letting, administration, or supervision of performance of the subcontract, if the costs are included in the hourly rates payable under paragraph (a)(1) of this clause. (5) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-(i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government.

(ii)

(c) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the

17

CC-10-HQ-R-0050 Lotus Notes Support Services

total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (d) Ceiling price. The Government shall not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer shall have notified the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and shall have specified in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (e) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract the Contracting Officer may request audit of the invoices or vouchers and substantiating material. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices or vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher or invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion voucher" or "completion invoice" and substantiating material, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms of (f) and (g)) of this section, the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion invoice or voucher, and substantiating material, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. (f) Assignment. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions: (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor. (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the

18

CC-10-HQ-R-0050 Lotus Notes Support Services

execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. (g) Refunds. The Contractor agrees that any refunds, rebates, or credits (including any related interest) accruing to or received by the Contractor or any assignee, that arise under the materials portion of this contract and for which the Contractor has received reimbursement, shall be paid by the Contractor to the Government. The Contractor and each assignee, under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, an assignment to the Government of such refunds, rebates, or credits (including any interest) in form and substance satisfactory to the Contracting Officer. (h) Interim payments. (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act. The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due date.

The Contracting Officer (CO) designated for administration of this contract(s) is Deirdre Eischens. The CO, in accordance with Subpart 1.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and notwithstanding any clauses contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the CO. In the event the Contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the CO, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.

______________ _________________ [List as necessary] (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of

42

CC-10-HQ-R-0050 Lotus Notes Support Services

the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

M.1

52.212-2 EVALUATION ­ COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1: Technical Capability Factor 2: Key Personnel/ Management Approach Factor 3: Past Performance Factor 4: Price When all of the non-price factors (1-3) are combined, they are significantly more important than price (4). (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. M.2 ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 ­EVALUATION ­COMMERCIAL ITEMS

As stated in 52.212-2, entitled Evaluation ­ Commercial Item, the factors that shall be used to evaluate the offers are technical capability, key personnel/management approach, past performance, and price with award being made to the Offeror who provide the best overall value to the Government. This addendum serves to further define both the evaluation process and evaluation factors. M.2.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA Evaluation of Proposals Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth below to determine the Offeror's demonstrated ability to provide the required services.

CC-10-HQ-R-0050 Lotus Notes Support Services

address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. Proposals that require substantial revisions because of significant omissions of information requested in the RFP, restate the requirements or statements from the RFP, or simply state that the Offeror's proposal is compliant with the RFP, without providing a description of the approaches, techniques, methodology or solutions may not be considered among the most highly rated proposals within the competitive range, if a competitive range is established. Proposals that fail to address all solicitation requirements may be considered deficient or unacceptable and may be excluded from further evaluation. M.2.2 BASIS FOR AWARD This is a best value acquisition as described in FAR 15.101-1. Offerors are cautioned that award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced Offeror. Rather, in accordance with the concept of "best value", the government reserves the right to pay a price premium for a proposal that is superior under the non-price factors. However, as Offerors approach parity under the non-price factors, price may become a determinative factor in the award decision. The Government may incorporate various portions of the winning Offeror's proposal into the resulting contract. The Government reserves the right to make one award or no award, depending upon the quality of the proposal submitted, the availability of funds, and the estimated number of tasks. OCC will not, in any case, make award to an Offeror it considers to have substandard capabilities or unreasonable prices. Following the evaluation of the final revised proposal, the Government will make an award to the responsible Offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria. M.2.3 COMPETITIVE RANGE The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of the initial offers received, without conducting discussion, in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(f), Contract Award. Therefore, initial offers should contain the Offeror's best terms from both a technical and pricing perspective. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by Contracting Officer to be necessary. Following the evaluation of the technical and price/business proposals, a competitive range determination may be made. This range will be comprised of the most highly rated Offerors. The Government may also reduce the number of highly rated proposals within the competitive range for purposes of efficiency in accordance with FAR 15.306. Discussions will be conducted with all vendors within the competitive range. All Offerors still within the competitive range, following discussions, may be requested to submit a written Final Revised Proposal. Offerors may be eliminated from the competitive range at any time if they are found unacceptable in one or more evaluation factors.

M.2.4 EVALUATION FACTORS The following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance, will be used to assess each proposal: Factor 1: Technical Capability Technical Capability shall be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror clearly demonstrated technical experience, technical understanding, and approach to this project as it relate to the PWS tasks. The Government will evaluate the suitability of the Offeror's proposed solution for the tasks and assess the quality of the solution, likelihood of the solution's success, inherent risk, methodology for approaching the solution, and overall understanding of the requirement. The Government will assess the Offeror's ability to provide a complete and integrated solution to the full scope and breadth of the PWS requirements and the adequacy of the Offeror's quality control plan to ensure quality controls are in place, which will result in tasks completed in a timely and satisfactory manner. Factor 2: Key Personnel/Management Approach The Government will assess the Offeror's key personnel qualifications, experience related to the PWS and suitability of the Offeror's management approach. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's approach for accomplishing, administering and managing the various tasks to accomplish the objectives and requirements identified in this RFP. Resource information such as assignment of labor hours to labor categories, etc., will be evaluated for its appropriateness to the overall requirement. The Government will assess the Offeror's ability to provide qualified staff in a timely fashion to execute the work. Factor 3: Past Performance The contractor's ability to perform will be evaluated based on demonstrated experience and performance, on both past and current contracts, involving tasks as closely related as possible to those set forth here. The OCC will contact a selection of the references provided during the evaluation process to verify relevant experience and level of performance. This evaluation will take into account the contractor's management and technical performance; quality assurance of deliverables; the utilization of appropriate types of resources and expertise; and the utilization and management of subcontractors, if any. If the Offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance or does not have any past performance information available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral. The Government reserves the right to utilize information from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Contractor Performance System (CPS), OCC's experience, if any, with the contractor; and any other source determined appropriate by the OCC. Factor 4: Price Price will be evaluated, but will not receive an adjectival rating. The Government will evaluate the total price proposed for each performance period (i.e. base and all option

years) to determine price reasonableness as it relates to the technical requirements and to assist in the best value determination. The Price Proposal will be evaluated for accuracy, completeness and reasonableness. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing pursuant to FAR 15.404-1 (g) (3). The Offeror's responses will be evaluated for technical adequacy of the response in conjunction with the total price and to determine whether it is fair and reasonable. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's use of the proposed labor categories and rates in its response. The Government will evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the labor rates as compared to industry norms such as the GSA Federal Supply Schedule or other government wide acquisition contracts.
