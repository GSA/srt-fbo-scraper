DG1330-11-RP-0009

SECTION E INSPECTION & ACCEPTANCE

E.1

STANDARD OF PERFORMANCE AND ACCEPTANCE OF SYSTEM(S)
In addition to the tests specified below or identified in any Government-provided SOWs, acceptance is contingent upon compliance with all requirements described in Section C and any additional requirements in the task orders including, but not limited to, adherence to Governance processes (e.g. Configuration Management) and IT Security Requirements. Acceptance is also contingent upon the delivery and correct functioning of any features offered beyond the requirements. During acceptance testing, to assure performance, the Government may exercise any component or service, confirm the functionality, or confirm the configuration. Acceptance is contingent upon successful completion of system certification and accreditation. E.1.1 General

This clause establishes a standard of performance which must be met before any equipment or software delivered under this contract is accepted by the Government. As solutions may be delivered at different times and potentially to different locations, all applicable tests will be applied to each component after delivery is complete. At the Government's discretion, at any time any component of the solution may be put back through all phases of acceptance to confirm performance is at proposed levels. All tests will be performed at the discretion of the Government. Acceptance testing is applicable to all solutions delivered or supported under this contract. These tests may also be applied to replacement equipment, equipment upgrades, substituted equipment, modified equipment, and equipment supplied as remediation of any contractual shortfall. If any software upgrades are unable to meet test criteria, then the Contractor is required to continue support for the existing software complement until such time as the upgraded software can meet test criteria. All portions of the acceptance tests, unless indicated differently by the Government, will be done during the same 30 consecutive day period within a ninety (90) day window. The ninety (90) day window starts from the commencement of acceptance testing. Should the Contractor fail to meet any of the tests, the contract may be terminated at the Government's discretion, or the Government may negotiate alternative remedies at its discretion. At the discretion of the Government, failure to meet a performance target may be remedied by providing additional or substitute hardware and software (any source code modifications to the benchmarks other than Class A must be approved by the Government).

8

Section E

DG1330-11-RP-0009

Class A modifications are those required to allow a benchmark to run to completion correctly if, without such changes to source code, the benchmark will "fail" either by exiting prior to completion or producing incorrect answers. Class A modifications do not include any changes to source code solely for performance. Since there may be many causes for such changes (e.g. existing non-standard language usage within the application, workarounds required for compiler bugs, etc.), the Government cannot state categorically that such modifications will not be evaluated without some sort of risk factor assigned. Still, it is the Government's desire to consider such changes as "essentially unmodified" code with no negative impact on evaluation. Among the types of "changes" that are deemed Class A modifications include but are not limited to: ˇ Use of commercially supported libraries that require no changes to benchmark source code or introduction of wrapper subroutines; ˇ Compiler command lines with performance-specific options including, but not limited to, automatic parallelization; ˇ Automatic parallelization and multitasking mediated through the operating system; and ˇ pre-processors. Use of commercially available and supported source

If additional or substitute hardware causes a facility impact, the Contractor shall be required to remedy the facility impact. The Government reserves the right to waive testing or change the testing window (either longer or shorter) before accepting a solution. E.1.2 Areas of Testing

The following describes a non-exhaustive description of some of the areas that may be tested during Inspection and Acceptance. The Government may identify additional areas of testing and any additional specific testing requirements at the task order level. E.1.2.1 Availability Each solution shall meet or exceed the

E.1.2.1.1 proposed availability.

E.1.2.1.2 The Government, at its discretion, may provide a series of carefully monitored tests that may include up to twenty-five (25) individual batch jobs (complete with input data) to run on a Contractor-provided HPCS. These tests will be monitored for end-to-end success. Complete or partial failure of any intermediate step will result in declaring the test to have failed. Success will be determined as the number of successful tests divided by the number of attempted tests in a thirty (30) day period per subsystem. This ratio 9

Section E

DG1330-11-RP-0009

must be equal or greater than the proposed availability during the acceptance test period as well as during the life of the contract. Failures due to null time, application errors, or data errors will not be included in either the numerator or denominator of the above ratio. E.1.2.2 Performance

Each solution shall meet all proposed performance specifications. The Government reserves the right to verify that performance is being met anytime, even after acceptance. Remedies as described in Section F apply to these post-acceptance performance tests. E.1.2.2.1 Benchmark Performance

E.1.2.2.1.1 All of the benchmarks, provided by the Government, must meet the performance criteria proposed by the Contractor. Failure to meet the performance criteria may not be remedied by performing any code modifications other than Class A to the benchmark codes unless these modifications have been approved by the Government. Other remedies include substitution of hardware that is approved by the Government or by providing additional hardware as described in Section F. E.1.2.2.1.2 The benchmark performance will be tested during the initial acceptance test period and at each periodic upgrade. E.1.2.2.2 Disk I/O Performance

When possible, all performance specifications indicated in the Contractor's proposal will be verified. Any failures to meet the specifications shall be remedied or result in failure of the acceptance test. Consistent disk I/O performance is required to meet the run time variability standard. E.1.2.3 Reproducibility

E.1.2.3.1 Codes that are known to provide bit reproducible results may be run at the Government's discretion. If the codes fail to produce the same results for repeated runs in an environment where bit reproducibility is expected on the same type of hardware/software, then the acceptance test is deemed to be failed until the Contractor can provide a remedy. Should the first instance of the test not be performed within twenty (20) days of the first instance of the bit reproducibility error, the Government will extend the acceptance test period one day for each day of delay or forego the test entirely. E.1.2.3.2 The Government requires the Contractor deliver bit reproducible results. The Government requires the Contractor deliver bit reproducible results, for the entire duration of the contract. 10

Section E

DG1330-11-RP-0009

E.1.2.3.3 In the event that a bit reproducibility error is found, a root cause and remedy is required in order to complete acceptance. E.1.2.4 Data Integrity

E.1.2.4.1 In the event that a data integrity problem is found, the Contractor shall identify and demonstrate root cause to the Government. The Contractor shall provide a remedy in order to complete acceptance. E.1.2.5 Run Time Variability

E.1.2.5.1 Benchmark and/or test codes will be monitored for run-time variability. The wall clock execution time for each code will be monitored and recorded over the course of acceptance. Run time variability standard requires these codes, of production quality with fixed input data, to execute within +/- 5% of average wall clock time. Codes are varied and may require access to massive data sets, thousands of processors, etc. The run time variability standard will not apply to benchmark/test codes that execute in less than thirty (30) seconds or longer than four (4) hours. A sample size of not less than thirty (30) runs is required to establish statistical significance. E.1.2.5.2 The run time variability standard for application codes using "live" data sets will be 5% for codes within one standard deviation of the mean. A sample size of not less than thirty (30) runs is required to establish statistical significance. The live data run time variability standard will not apply to codes that execute in less than thirty (30) seconds or longer than eight (8) hours. E.1.2.6 Acceptance Test Spreadsheet

The COTR, or an appropriate designee, will construct and maintain during the acceptance tests a spreadsheet that shows all metrics designated by the acceptance test criteria and record all events, and the diagnosed causes contributing to these results. This spreadsheet will be provided at the task order level. The Contractor will maintain complete and accurate records indicating component (hardware/software/infrastructure) failures, degraded performance, repair/maintenance service and a record of any Government direction influencing acceptance tests. The COTR, selected NOAA staff (including affiliates and contract staff) involved in the acceptance testing, and Contractor representatives shall meet routinely during the acceptance test period to agree on event categorizations and descriptions, and to validate the acceptance test criteria metrics. Should the Contractor fail to meet Government requirements the contract may be terminated for default.

E.2.3.1 The system must be in use, with a minimum 90% of resources engaged at any time. E.2.3.2 During the first fifteen (15) days of acceptance the Government may elect to restrict system use to benchmark codes. Multiple copies of these codes will be run in a random manner so as to employ all resources in an unpredictable manner. E.2.3.3 During the second fifteen (15) days of acceptance, NCEP will be able to run benchmark and development workloads on the system. The Contractor shall not be held responsible for user-caused system faults. The Government will terminate user access during acceptance should there be more than two system-wide user-caused faults or other disruption that causes utilization to fall below 90%. E.2.3.4 Unless indicated differently by the Government, acceptance testing will be done during the same thirty (30) consecutive day period within a ninety (90) day window. The ninety (90) day window starts from the commencement of acceptance testing. E.2.3.5 During the thirty (30) consecutive day period all contractual and proposed performance and availability measures will be met. E.2.3.6 The Contractor shall be required to monitor performance and provide documentation on results. E.2.4 Exiting Acceptance

E.2.4.1 All documentation, logs, scripts, programs, and output relevant to the acceptance test is captured and archived. E.2.4.2 All performance and availability requirements have been met or exceeded and have been confirmed by the COTR to the Contracting Officer. E.2.4.3 The Contracting Officer will lead and complete negotiations with regards to any issues during the acceptance tests.

Section F

DG1330-11-RP-0009

SECTION F DELIVERIES OR PERFORMANCE F.1 CONSIDERATION
The integrated components of the High Performance Computing Systems (HPCS) and facilities shall meet the performance requirements cited in Section C.3 and additional requirements identified at the task order level. If the Contractor does not meet the performance requirements, then consideration is owed to the Government. Consideration is applied to all hardware, software, facilities and services that the Contractor delivers and/or supports, and may be applied across task and delivery orders as applicable. The Government may, at its discretion, choose new equipment as consideration at no additional cost to the Government, reduce invoice payment(s) by the amount of consideration owed, or both. F.1.1 Operational Use Time Operational Use Time requirement is defined in Section C.3.3.2 and Section C, Appendix H (glossary). Operational Use Time is determined monthly. During any month, Operational Use Time is determined by considering all primary and backup WCOSS resources in which a subset of this total resource is necessary to execute the entire NCEP Production Suite (NPS). The NPS executes on either the primary or backup WCOSS. The 30-month periodic expansions/refreshes/upgrades are defined in Section C.3.6. Within each 30-month lifecycle NPS consumes approximately 30% of the resources of one WCOSS (either primary or backup) during the start of the lifecycle and approximately 90% of the resources during the end of the lifecycle. F.1.2 Development Use Time Development Use Time requirement is defined in Section C.3.3.4 and Section C, Appendix H (glossary). Development Use Time is determined monthly. During any month, Development Use Time is determined by considering all primary and backup WCOSS resources minus the resources necessary to execute the entire NCEP Production Suite (NPS). The Transition to Operations (T2O) executes within the Development Use Time and the T2O will execute on the primary and/or backup WCOSS. F.1.3 Consideration for Not Meeting Performance Requirements If the primary and backup WCOSS components, including facilities, are inoperable or unavailable and results in performance below the Operational Use Time and Development Use Time requirements defined in 16

Section F

DG1330-11-RP-0009

Section C.3.3, and any additional requirements identified at the task order level, through no fault of the Government, then the Government is entitled to consideration. Consideration shall be calculated based on the total monthly invoice amount as described in the table below. Consideration shall be based on root cause analysis. Performance Requirement Contractor shall achieve 99.9% or greater Operational Use Time Disincentives 99.8% = Government pays 95% total invoice for the month 99.7% = Government pays 90% total invoice for the month 99.6% = Government pays 85% total invoice for the month 99.5% = Government pays 80% total invoice for the month Less than 99.5% = Government pays 75% total invoice for the month. Less than 99% = Government pays total invoice minus one half percentage(s) missed for the Development Use Time. For example, if the Contractor achieved 95% Development Use Time, the Government pays 98% total invoice for the month: 98% = 100% ­ ((99% ­ 95%) / 2).

Contractor shall achieve 99% or greater Development Use Time

(End of clause)

FAR 52.215-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION (JAN 2004)
(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-- "Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the Offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.

59

Section L

DG1330-11-RP-0009

"In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the Offeror.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-- (1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received.

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.

61

Section L

DG1330-11-RP-0009

(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an Offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the Offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.

Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (9) Offerors may submit proposals that depart from stated requirements.

62

Section L

DG1330-11-RP-0009

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the Offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-- (1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this Offeror as a result of--or in connection with--the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with Offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

63

Section L

DG1330-11-RP-0009

(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the Offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with Offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting Offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed Offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed Offeror and past performance information on the debriefed Offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all Offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful Offeror.

64

Section L

DG1330-11-RP-0009

(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed Offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. (End of provision)

(b) In the event of any conflict between the terms proposed by the Offeror and the terms in the clause at FAR 52.232-32, PerformanceBased Payments, the terms of the clause at FAR 52.232-32 shall govern. (c) The Contracting Officer will not accept the Offeror's proposed performance-based payment financing if the financing does not conform to the following limitations: (1) The Government will make delivery payments only for supplies delivered and accepted, or services rendered and accepted in accordance with the payment terms of this contract.

(f) The Government will adjust each proposed price to reflect the cost of providing the proposed performance-based payments to determine the total cost to the Government of that particular combination of price and performance-based financing. The Government will make the adjustment using the procedure described in FAR 32.205(c). (End of provision)

In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d), the Government will perform a cost realism analysis by independently reviewing and estimating the specific elements of each Offeror's proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed costs elements are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the unique methods of performance described in the Offeror's technical proposals. A cost realism analysis will be used to determine the probable cost of performance for each Offeror. The probable cost will be determined by adjusting each Offeror's proposed cost, and fee when appropriate, to reflect any additions or reductions in cost elements to realistic levels based on the results of the cost realism analysis. M.2.3 Evaluation Factors Relative Importance

Technical Approach will be weighted more important than Management Approach and Past Performance. Management Approach and Past Performance are of equal importance. The combination of Technical Approach, Management Approach, and Past Performance will be significantly more important than Cost/Price. Facilities Inspection is pass/fail only. (End of clause)

M.3

RATING SCHEME
M.3.1 Technical Approach, Management Approach and Past Performance portions of each proposal will be evaluated for its strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies. Each factor will be assigned an adjectival rating based on its subfactors. Each subfactor will be assigned an adjectival rating based on the table below. Each Offeror will then be assigned a summary adjectival rating.

Table M.3.1 ­ Technical and Management Approach The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes numerous strengths, and essentially no weaknesses, which is expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes strengths, and few relatively minor weaknesses, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has weaknesses of substance and strengths, which if they exist, are outweighed by the weaknesses. Collectively, the strengths and weaknesses are not likely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous weaknesses of substance, and strengths which, if they exist, are far outweighed by weaknesses. Collectively, the strengths and weaknesses will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement.

M.3.2

Strengths, Weaknesses and Deficiencies

The definitions of strength and weakness will be used for the evaluation of all subfactors. The definition of deficiency will be used for the evaluation of all factors. The definitions are as follows: M.3.2.1 Strength is defined as: above standards/expectations; represents a benefit to the Government. M.3.2.2 Weakness is a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. M.3.2.3 Deficiency is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. M.3.3 Past Performance Rating Scheme

The following table will be used in rating past performance in accordance with Section M.2.1.3 and Section M.2.2.3. Table M.3.3 ­ Past Performance UNSATISFACTORY/ VERY HIGH PERFORMANCE RISK MARGINAL/HIGH PERFORMANCE RISK SATISFACTORY/ MODERATE PERFORMANCE RISK VERY GOOD/LOW PERFORMANCE RISK EXCEPTIONAL/VERY LOW PERFORMANCE RISK Based on the Offeror's poor performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the requirement effort. Based on the Offeror's marginal performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's satisfactory but not otherwise exemplary performance record, some doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's very good performance record, little doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's exceptional performance record, no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. The Offeror has no experience relevant to the present requirements, or, after all reasonable efforts, the Contracting Officer was unable to obtain past performance information for relevant prior contracts. In this situation, an Offeror shall not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably for past performance and shall receive a neutral rating. Note: If an Offeror's experience is a separate factor or subfactor, then the evaluation for that factor/subfactor shall take into account the Offeror's lack of relevant experience.

SUBCONTRACTING PLAN EVALUATION
The Department of Commerce in coordination with the U.S. Small Business Administration established the following subcontracting goals for FY2010. The Government reserves the right to update its subcontracting goals. Subcontracting plans will be evaluated and negotiated to help achieve these goals. These small business subcontracting goals apply to the total contract value. Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting plan shall make the Offeror ineligible for award of a contract. Subcontracting Goals Small Business Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) 8(a) Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) HUBZone Small Business (HUBZ) Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVO) 34.50% 12.00% N/A 10.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00%

ORGANIZATION CONFLICT OF INTEREST EVALUATION
M.5.1 The Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Plan is required (if the Offeror is in the competitive range) but not rated. M.5.2 Pursuant to FAR Part 9, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's OCI Plan to determine whether the Offeror has adequately described the existence, nature and scope of potential and actual OCIs and the acceptable mitigation thereof. The Government will also evaluate the effectiveness of any processes implemented in the OCI Plan for the identification, Government notification, avoidance, and mitigation of any existing or prospective potential or actual OCIs, and the extent of Offeror's demonstrated understanding of the FAR 9.5 requirements as applied to the WCOSS Program.

1. OBJECTIVES
This program is referenced as the Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputer System (WCOSS). Operational High Performance Computing (HPC) resources are essential to support the processing of sophisticated numerical models used to predict and understand atmospheric and oceanic phenomena for weather and climate operational use. The WCOSS refers to the primary and backup supercomputers, related facilities, hardware, software and services. WCOSS refers to the total solution unless otherwise specified with the primary/backup modifier. This SOW describes those tasks required to design, develop, deliver, integrate, configure, test, validate, monitor, document, support, enhance, refresh, upgrade, fit-up and sustain the WCOSS total solution defined as the primary and backup supercomputers, related contractor provided facilities, and hardware, software and services. At the core of this mission are WCOSS capabilities that achieve NOAA's objectives and govern the intended use of WCOSS throughout the life of the contract. WCOSS supports the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) mission for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy. The Contractor shall deliver and sustain the WCOSS throughout the life of the contract: to have non-disruptive reliable 7x24x365 (see Appendix H) performance to meet schedule-sensitive production cycles and reliable dissemination of model products; to meet the highest levels of reliability in order to achieve NOAA's operational HPC mission; and to scale to meet NOAA's future demands through non-disruptive expansions, refreshes, upgrades and fitups. The objectives of the WCOSS mission include acquiring the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Primary and Backup WCOSS (two Operational HPC systems) Facilities to house the Primary and Backup WCOSS HPC related services Facilities related services Balanced HPC lifecycle technology expansions/refreshes with facilities Project Management (PM) Growth options

BACKGROUND
2.1 INTRODUCTION The DOC NOAA mission faces new urgency given the intensifying national needs of the environment, the economy, and public safety. NOAA WCOSS serves the NOAA mission by providing significant computational capability, which is the basis for modeling and simulation infrastructure support for NOAA's operational HPC applications. These applications assess and predict environmental changes to support protecting life and property; providing decision makers with reliable scientific information; managing the nation's living marine and coastal resources; and fostering global environmental stewardship. Operational environmental prediction models are coordinated, developed, and maintained by the NWS National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), Environmental Modeling Center (EMC). EMC model coordination is across numerous organizations including NOAA and NWS offices/centers; Department of Defense (DoD); international meteorological centers; and other organizations linked to environmental modeling. These operational models run on two HPC systems (Primary WCOSS and Backup WCOSS) operated by NCEP Central Operations (NCO). NOAA's current contract for WCOSS expires on September 30, 2011. This acquisition will establish a new contract to include a transition period to migrate from the old to the new contract.
The WCOSS consists of the NCEP Production Suite (NPS) and the Transition-to-Operations (T2O) capability. The NPS executes the operational production of the model runs from which the weather, climate, ocean and space weather forecasts are made. The NPS currently generates more than 14.8 million operational model products, which are disseminated each day to Government agencies, commercial interests, and the public. The NPS is currently comprised of approximately 900 applications, 40 of which utilize Message Passing Interface (MPI). The T2O consists of the processes that support model enhancements and next generation forecast models destined for NPS operations. T2O serves as a critical link in the chain from research, to development, and finally, to operations. During normal operations, the NPS runs on a subset of the Primary WCOSS and the T2O runs on both the Primary and Backup WCOSS. The WCOSS is designed to interchangeably host the NPS or T2O and provides the framework to fail over the NPS and T2O to the other HPC system. The implementation of the WCOSS is part of the NOAA's High Performance Computing Strategic Plan for FY2010-2014, which calls for computing infrastructure improvements to support Operational HPC missions, see http://www.cio.noaa.gov/HPCC/pdfs/HPC_Strategic_Plan.pdf. The WCOSS supports NOAA's strategic mission in delivering trusted, timely and accurate environmental assessments and predictions through next-generation models that are integrated, interoperable, mission-driven and accessible. WCOSS capabilities are vital in supporting NOAA's lifecycle modeling strategy which includes transition to operations, operational model production, and operations to research. NOAA utilizes HPC for operational weather forecasts, climate prediction, and the NPS / T2O that supports those forecasts and predictions. Model products are produced on-demand; on hourly,

clock-driven cycles; and on periodic calendar-driven cycles. The model products created on the WCOSS help fulfill the Government's mission to protect life and property. The two current HPC systems within the WCOSS reside in two geographically diverse locations to ensure continuity of operations. The Primary WCOSS is located in Gaithersburg, MD at the current contractor's facility. The Backup WCOSS is located in Fairmont, WV at the NASA's IV&V facility (a Government furnished facility). NOAA is recognized as a world leader in understanding and predicting the Earth's environment through advanced modeling capabilities, climate research and real time weather products. The growing concern of global climate change, weather impacts upon homeland security and aviation, hurricanes, tornadoes and other severe weather have spurred growing demand for weather, climate, ocean, and space weather information with increased accuracy, shorter lead times and greater model resolution. NOAA's aggressive modeling plans are linked to the HPC technology curve which improves price-performance ratios over time providing increased computing resources critical to meet modeling objectives. WCOSS model run start and end times are available online at the following URL: http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/nwprod/prodstat/. The WCOSS must continually provide greater computing performance to guarantee increasingly more complex environmental models are executed reliably on-time, all the time. The models must complete on time with growing amounts of input data including observational and satellite data synchronized to an external (outside of WCOSS) worldwide data collection cycle (see Appendix G). The WCOSS must be highly dependable to run operational models many times a day within a prescribed time window (see Appendix F) to reliably disseminate model guidance products on a fixed time schedule.

IT Security is led by the IT System Security Officer (ITSSO) who is a member of NCO. The ITSSO works in collaboration with a combination of Government and contractor support personnel who have responsibility for monitoring and maintaining all hardware, software, training, and policies consistent with all DOC, NOAA and other Federal requirements. The NOAA Computer Incident Response Team (N-CIRT) provides additional support, including incident response handling.

Each forecast system in the NPS runs in a fixed time window (see Appendix F). Model systems may not start early, nor may they finish late due to strict product delivery commitments and subsequent run dependencies. These circumstances produce a very high peak-to-average computational load ratio and drive platform requirements accordingly. Table 2.9-1 lists the major components of the NPS expected to be operational at the start of the proposed contract. The current WCOSS also supports National Ocean Service (NOS) and Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) mission requirements and WCOSS may support other organizations in the future at the discretion of the Government. NPS components are defined in Appendix C. Over the life of the contract the computational load will increase due to higher resolution, more sophisticated physics and data assimilation algorithms, additional ensemble members, and new observations. New components will be added to the NPS to meet expanding forecast service requirements throughout the proposed contract. T ABLE 2.9-1: M AJOR NPS COMPONENTS AT PRESENT.

The Contractor shall provide periodic upgrades using a risk reduction process. The cycle of periodic upgrades shall start with the new configurations being demonstrated with a small test machine (see C.3.4.14) and implemented in the WCOSS environments using a schedule approved by the Government.

3.6.3 PERIODIC UPGRADE PROCESS

3.6.4 WORKLOAD PROJECTIONS The Contractor shall provide periodic upgrades as described in Table 3.6-1, Section C.3.6 and Section J, Attachment 6. Table 3.6-1 summarizes the estimated cumulative x-factor increases over the life of the contract. Table 3.6-1 is based on the current WCOSS (see Appendix A). Compute performance is measured by the average of the capability benchmarks where 1x is the actual performance of the current WCOSS (see Section J, Attachment 6). Optional funding xfactor compute performance requires three times the number of copies for the capability benchmarks (see Section J, Attachment 6). Computational workload projections are derived from the NPS as it is implemented on the current WCOSS and from anticipated requirements over the life of the contract.

CONFIGURATION OF WCOSS' SYSTEMS AS OF DECEMBER, 2010

This information is provided solely as a reference for orientation by potential Offerors. It does not reflect any requirements of the WCOSS RFP, nor does it represent equipment or software preferences, functional capabilities, compatibilities, capacities, etc. As of December 2010, NCEP WCOSS consisted of two IBM Power6 Clusters. The Primary system, normally used for NWS operations, is located within the Contractor's facility in Gaithersburg, MD. The Backup system, a functional clone of the Primary, is located at NASA's IV&V facility in Fairmont, WV. The Backup typically handles a research and development workload but is designed to handle NWS operations under continuity of operations concept and as part of the quarterly WCOSS patching cycle (e.g. security and errata patches). Under the NCEP's WCOSS contract, the final upgrade during the base period of performance, termed "Phase-II," was made operational on August 2009. The two discrete HPC systems are managed independently such the Primary runs operational (time-critical) work and the Backup runs primarily development work but is immediately available for business continuity Backup functions. These two HPC systems are functionally symmetrical. The configuration presented below summarizes the WCOSS HPC systems: Primary WCOSS Gaithersburg, MD Highlights: 14 Frames 156 IBM Power6 IH nodes 144 compute/batch nodes 8 GPFS nodes 2 interactive nodes 2 DBNet (dataflow) nodes 4992 processors 4.7 GHz processors 69.7 TFLOPS (Linpak sustained) ~20TB RAM 19712GB (154 nodes @ 128GB each) 512GB (2 interactive nodes @ 256GB each) 320 TB Tier 1 GPFS disk

GLOSSARY
7x24x365 is a term to describe high-availability and defined as seven days a week, 24 hours a day, each and every day of the year.

Capability: Ability to execute a fixed number of copies of a benchmark application across multiple nodes in as short a period of wall-clock time as possible.

Capacity: Ability to simultaneously execute as many copies of a benchmark application utilizing the entire system within a specified wall-clock limit.

Development Use Time (DUT) is defined as the percentage of time development jobs can run on the WCOSS. DUT is determined by considering all WCOSS resources minus the resources necessary to execute the entire NCEP Production Suite (NPS). The Transition to Operations (T2O) executes within the DUT and the T2O will execute on the Primary and Backup WCOSS. DUT shall be computed monthly as follows:

DUT = (

TDT - DDT - NULL ) TDT - NULL

TDT = Total Development Time is the total number of processor minutes in a month not consumed by the NPS DDT = Development Down Time is the total number of processor minutes when WCOSS resources were not available to run development applications NULL = Development Down Time that the government has agreed to exclude from the monthly DUT calculation DUT calculation will be rounded as noted in the following examples: Example 1: if DUT is 98.5%, DUT will be rounded to 99%. Example 2: if DUT is 98.49%, DUT will be rounded to 98%.

Down-Time: The period of time when the WCOSS hardware, software, facilities, and/or services are unavailable. The start of Down-Time is based on root cause analysis. Down-Time ends when the WCOSS is returned to NCEP in operable condition. The WCOSS, facilities, or individual component thereof, may be declared inoperative while problem diagnosis takes place. During a period of Down-Time, NCEP may continue to use operable components of the WCOSS when such action does not interfere with maintenance of the inoperable component.

Operational Use Time: Operational Use Time (OUT) is defined as the percentage of time the NCEP Production Suite (NPS) can run on the WCOSS. OUT is determined by considering all WCOSS resources in which a subset of this total resource is necessary to execute the entire NPS. The NPS executes on either the Primary or Backup WCOSS. Within each 30-month lifecycle, see C.3.6, NPS consumes approximately 30% of the resources of one WCOSS during the start of the lifecycle and approximately 90% of the resources of one WCOSS during the end of the lifecycle. The NPS will never consume more resources than can be supplied by either the Primary or Backup WCOSS. OUT shall be computed monthly as follows:

OUT = (

TOT - ODT - NULL ) TOT - NULL

TOT = Total Operational Time is the total number of minutes in a month ODT = Operational Down Time is the total number of minutes when WCOSS resources were not available to run the entire NPS NULL = Operational Down Time that the government has agreed to exclude from the monthly OUT calculation OUT calculation will be rounded as noted in the following examples: Example 1: if OUT is 99.75%, OUT will be rounded to 99.8%. Example 2: if OUT is 99.749%, OUT will be rounded to 99.7%.

Operational Support: Multi-tiered support in which a first tier is available on a 24X7 basis and deep expertise is available during business hours that can resolve the most difficult issues. Service levels are defined and agreed to for each level of support.

Reliability: The ability of a system or component of the system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time without failure or interruption in service.

SOW DG1330-11-RP-0009
System Availability: The percentage of time the WCOSS was available to run operational (NPS) and development (T2O) jobs. System Availability is determined for the Primary WCOSS and is determined for the Backup WCOSS. Each WCOSS maintains a separate monthly System Availability metric. System Availability shall be computed as the ratio of total processor minutes available for running the operational and development suites to the total processor minutes available each month. System availability shall be calculated as follows:

SystemAvailability = (

TPT - DT - NULL ) TPT - NULL

TPT = Total Processing Time is the total number of processor minutes in a month for the Primary WCOSS and for the Backup WCOSS DT = Down Time is the total number of processor minutes when the Primary WCOSS resources and Backup WCOSS were not available to run operational and/or development applications NULL = Total number of minutes that the government has agreed to exclude from the monthly DT calculation

ATTACHMENT 6 BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS
13 December 2010 The benchmark codes, data and information are accessible from the web portal: http://rdhpcs.noaa.gov/wcossfinal. The scaling study for each of the benchmarks executed on the current Primary WCOSS system (see Section C Appendix A) is contained in each benchmark subdirectory and in Tables 2a, 2b and 2c below. Directions for building and executing each benchmark are contained in a README in each benchmark directory. The contractor shall complete tables 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 3e, and 3f related to the performance of the benchmark suite for the offered Primary and Backup WCOSS Source code optimizations made outside of Class A require the Contractor to propose an additional full set of tables. Performance projection methodology must be described in detail. The capability benchmark codes consist of the global forecast model GFS T878, the global analysis GSI T878L, the mesoscale forecast model NMM 9km, and the wave model WW3. The capacity benchmark is the GFS T382. The Contractor shall provide measurements for three distinct configurations to demonstrate scalability of the benchmark codes on a single system in Tables 1a and 1b. The Contractor shall describe the configuration of each system, with respect to architecture, number of processors and amount of memory. The capability and capacity benchmarks will make up a major portion of the Live Test Demonstration suite, see Section L.7.2. Table 1a shall contain wall clock run times in seconds for the capability benchmark codes. This table is intended to aid the government in determining the risk associated with performance projections. The scaling study for Table 1a shall include one data point at or near the proposed processor count used for the X-factor in Table 2a. Table 1b shall contain the number of forecast hours completed in a 60minute window for the capacity benchmark GFS T382. Although the GFS T382 is a capacity benchmark, the government is interested in the scalability of the GFS T382 on the proposed system under various system configurations. Table 2a (Base Funding) and Table 2d (Base + Optional Funding) for the Base Period shall contain either actual or projected system performance, and noted as actual or projected, as a guaranteed speedup X-factor relative to the previous phase baseline operational system for each individual benchmark's number of concurrent copies. The capability baseline consists of running each individual benchmark's number of concurrent copies across the compute only nodes. The speedup X-factor is computed by dividing the

Section J

DG1330-11-RP-0009

previous phase baseline operational system wall clock time by the proposed wall clock time. The initial delivery column is the speedup X-factor over the current WCOSS Baseline and the phase II column is the speedup X-factor over the initial delivery column. Table 3a (Base Funding) and Table 3d (Base + Optional Funding) are for the Option Period with the Phase III column being the speedup X-factor over the Phase II column and the Phase IV column being the speedup X-factor over the Phase III column. Table 2b (Base Funding) and Table 2e (Base + Optional Funding) for the Base Period shall contain either actual or projected system performance, and noted as actual or projected, as a guaranteed increase factor compared to the number of hours forecast in 60 wall clock minutes on the previous phase baseline WCOSS system. The current WCOSS Baseline Forecast Hours was measured on the current Primary WCOSS system. The vendor is encouraged to run as many concurrent copies as possible to maximize the throughput and increase the total number of forecast hours. The capacity baseline consists of running copies of the capacity benchmark for as many forecast hours in one wall clock hour using only the compute nodes. The speedup X-factor is computed by dividing the proposed forecast hours by the previous phase baseline operational system forecast hours. The initial delivery column is the speedup X-factor over the current WCOSS Baseline and the phase II column is the speedup X-factor over the initial delivery column. Table 3b (Base Funding) and Table 3e (Base + Optional Funding) are for the Option Period with the Phase III column being the speedup X-factor over the Phase II column and the Phase IV column being the speedup X-factor over the Phase III column. Table 2c (Base Funding) and Table 2f (Base + Optional Funding) for the Base Period shall contain either actual or projected system performance, and noted as actual or projected, as a guaranteed speedup factor relative to the previous phase baseline operational system for the Copygb IO benchmark using no more than 7% of the compute nodes. The Copygb IO baseline consists of running 320 instances on no more than 7% of the current Primary WCOSS nodes. The Copygb IO time is computed from when the first job starts to when the last job finishes. The speedup X-factor is computed by dividing the previous phase baseline operational system wall clock time by the proposed wall clock time. The initial delivery column is the speedup X-factor over the current WCOSS Baseline and the phase II column is the speedup X-factor over the initial delivery column. Similarly, Table 3c (Base Funding) and Table 3f (Base + Optional Funding) are for the Option Period with the Phase III column being the speedup X-factor over the Phase II column and the Phase IV column being the speedup X-factor over the Phase III column. The government shall determine the benchmark codes for each future upgrade beyond the initial delivery. The benchmarks will be based on the following: 1. The capability benchmark suite will consist of the operational or soon to be operational versions of the global forecast, global analysis, meso forecast, and marine model. 2. The capacity benchmark will be the operational or soon to be operational version of the global forecast model at approximately one third of the operational resolution.

Section J

DG1330-11-RP-0009

3. The Copygb IO benchmark will remain the same however the input file size will double. 4. A new baseline will be generated on the operational system for each benchmark to use for measuring the next phase speedup guarantee. The Contractor will be allowed to make benchmark improvements, subject to the requirements in Section C. All changes to the benchmarks shall be provided to the Government. The Government reserves the right to disallow source code/script changes that impairs portability or complicates the code to the extent that readability suffers and maintenance costs increase as determined by the Government. The Government will provide a detailed explanation for any source code / script changes disallowed.

TIMELY PAYMENTS TO SUBCONTRACTORS FAR 19.702 requires company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your subcontracts with small, small disadvantaged, womenowned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. Your company has established and uses such procedures: 9. DESCRIPTION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT Maximum practicable utilization of small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U. S. C. 637 (d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor. In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small, HUBZone small, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take. These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan. 10.
