1. Background
           1. EES Business Context
Introduction:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) are the
primary users of the Establishment Evaluation System (EES).  The mission of CDER is to assure that safe and effective drugs are available to the
American people.  This is accomplished through a variety of means, one of which is the evaluation of drug manufacturing practices in conjunction
with the review of applications for marketing of new and generic drugs.  The mission of ORA is to protect consumers and enhance public health by
maximizing compliance of FDA regulated products with laws and regulations and minimizing risk associated with those products.  Evaluation of
drug manufacturing establishments is a collaborative effort between CDER and ORA.
EES was implemented in 1996 as a mission important application for CDER, where it is used in support of the drug application review process
through submission and tracking of Establishment Evaluation Requests (EERs).    EER submission is a required step in the chemistry review
process that occurs after a sponsor submits a New Drug Application (NDA) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), as well as some types of
NDA and ANDA supplements, to FDA for approval.  An EER is a request for evaluation and possible inspection of an establishment that is involved
in the drug manufacturing process. Establishments that are associated with a drug application must be deemed acceptable in order for the
application to be approved by FDA.  EERs that are submitted by CDER drug application reviewers through EES are screened by the CDER Office of
Compliance.  Those EERs that require further assessment are forwarded to ORA and potentially lead to manufacturing site inspections.
Additionally, EES plays an important role in the screening of drug imports by ORA.  EES is used by ORA Import Inspectors to help verify the
acceptability for import of FDA-approved drugs that are manufactured outside the U.S.  EES supports approximately 750 users, including CDER and
ORA users in Maryland as well as ORA users in field locations across the country.  Primary users of the system are Review Chemists in the New
Drugs review divisions and in the Office of Generic Drugs, Compliance Coordinators in the Office of Compliance and Pre-Approval Managers and
Import Inspectors in ORA.

Process:

When a new NDA, ANDA or specific type of supplemental NDA/ANDA is received by CDER, the assigned review Chemist or Regulatory Project Manager
will use EES to submit EERs for all associated facilities.  These EERs are transmitted to the CDER Office of Compliance (OC) and appear in the
EES inboxes of the Compliance Coordinators.  The Compliance Coordinator is responsible for evaluating, for each EER, the status of the
associated establishment with regard to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP).  This is accomplished through reference to CGMP history
data that are viewable from within EES.  Using judgment guided by defined criteria, the Compliance Coordinator either makes an EER
recommendation of Acceptable back to the originating NDA/ANDA review division or forwards the EER to a Pre-Approval Manager (PAM) in ORA for
further evaluation.  The EER is routed to the PAM’s EES inbox.  The PAM determines whether an establishment site inspection is required and, if
so, submits an Inspection Assignment Request.  This request is transmitted to ORA’s Field Accomplishment and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS)
via an automated EES/FACTS interface.  The details of the inspection are captured within FACTS.  At various points in the process, inspection-
related information (e.g. FACTS inspection assignment ID, date inspection was scheduled, date inspection was performed) is transmitted back to
EES to enable CDER to track the progress of the inspection.  The PAM ultimately makes an EER recommendation back to the Compliance Coordinator,
either based upon a review of existing establishment history (if no inspection is required) or after an inspection is conducted and the results
documented.  The process loop is closed when the Compliance coordinator submits recommendations back to the originating NDA/ANDA review division
for each EER, and collectively at an overall application level for all EERs associated with the drug application.  Throughout the EER life
cycle, EES captures EER milestone information at designated points and disseminates “tickler” email notices of key system events, such as
“Overall OC Recommendation Issued” and “EER Cancelled” to the appropriate audience.


1.2   EES Technical Context


Architecture/Operating Environment:

The EES data are housed in approximately 50 tables that reside in an Oracle 10G databases located on a Sun Solaris server T2000.  Administration
of the database is the responsibility of the FDA Office of Information Management (OIM) database administration staff.  EES is accessed via the
user’s web browser and is comprised of 40 Oracle 10G Forms, 20 Oracle 10G Reports, 52 database stored procedures, packages, functions and
triggers and assorted Unix batch processes and SQL scripts.  (Numbers could vary slightly by the time of contract award.)

Interfaces:

EES features interfaces to several other FDA systems/databases, including:

 • FACTS - EES exchanges establishment evaluation related data with ORA’s Field Accomplishments and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS) by means
   of data staging tables, database links, database procedures and batch processes.  Triggering events within both databases result in the
   writing of data to staging tables.  Batch processes periodically monitor these tables and update the EES and FACTS databases accordingly.
 • DARRTS – EES reads and, in some cases stores, drug application data from CDER’s Document Archiving, Reporting and Regulatory Tracking System
   (DARRTS).
 • DADS – EES reads and stores establishment name and address data from CDER’s Developers and Distributors System (DADS), and also updates that
   data.  DADS is CDER’s primary repository of name and address information for entities that are involved in the drug development, manufacturing
   and distribution process.
 • EASE – EES reads and stores EES user non-confidential information (e.g., name, organization, email address) from the FDA Enterprise
   Administrative Support Environment (EASE).
 • FML – Through its interface to FACTS, EES reads and stores establishment name and address data from ORA’s Firms Master List repository of
   information on entities with which FDA conducts business related to FDA-regulated products.

4.0 Tasks to Be Performed
4.1 EES Ongoing Operations and Maintenance
The contractor shall provide all necessary IT operations support and maintenance procedures for IT systems. A sample list of the type of work to
be performed under this task area is includes but is not limited to the following:
    • IT service management
    • Operational support
    • Software support
    • Electronic software licensing services including license: deployment, management, tracking, upgrading, etc.
    • IT maintenance & enhancement
    • Technical support
    • IT operation and maintenance planning
    • Web technology
    • Client/server operations
    • System documentation support
    • Technical Writing Support
    • Training (where required)
Operations and maintenance on IT systems shall include all software and hardware associated with mainframe CPU's, PC-client/server, network-
backbone-front end processors and all networks. The Offeror shall operate and maintain IT systems at current vendor release levels or government-
off-the-shelf (GOTS) applications software upgrades.

The contractor shall provide ongoing Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the EES application.  The contractor shallensure that team members are
cross-trained on ongoing O&M responsibilities such that backup support is available on an uninterrupted basis during normal Government business
hours.


EES ongoing O&M typically includes (but is not limited to) the following core set of activities.


Routine (daily, weekly or monthly) activities:


4.1.1     EES data analysis and correction - Periodically the support team is called upon to perform administrative functions upon the EES data
to resolve data errors and issues that cannot be resolved by users through the EES application.


4.1.2     User access support for both local and field users (activate/deactivate users, resolve user access problems) – EES utilizes Oracle
role-based access whereby users access the application via individually assigned Oracle accounts to which roles have been assigned.  User access
is further controlled through tracking of users within EES-specific Oracle tables.  The FDA manages Oracle accounts and roles.  The EES support
team manages user data within the EES-specific tables.  Deactivation typically occurs automatically via a batch process that checks FDA employee
data in EASE on a daily basis.


4.1.3     Response to Customer Service Requests (CSRs) – EES includes an option for submission of CSRs.  However, since EES went into
production, new CSR submission mechanisms have been developed that are more frequently used.  These include an EES support team email box and
the FDA IT help desk.  The EES team is responsible for monitoring their mailbox and for responding to EES-related incidents that are forwarded
to the team by the help desk incident management application.  EES support team members have access to the incident management application and
are responsible for update and closure of EES incident tickets.


4.1.4    Conduct of impact analysis for EES changes that have been requested through the EES Change Control Board and for planned changes to the
IT infrastructure or to interfacing applications/databases – Such impact analysis is generally conducted at a high level for the purpose of
supporting CCB decisions or assessing rough level-of-effort and EES modifications that will be required to accommodate changes to the
infrastructure and interfacing applications.


4.1.5     Provision of EES custom data queries – The EES sponsoring office, the CDER Office of Compliance, periodically requests provision of
custom reports and data sets that cannot be obtained through the existing suite of EES reports.  These requests are typically in support of
Office of Compliance meetings, presentations and requests for information from CDER management and external entities, such as Congress.  They
often have a short turnaround time and are not initially well-defined, and therefore require someone with sharp analytical and data query skills
in order to fulfill in a timely manner.


4.1.6     Response to requests for information about EES – These requests may be for factual or advisory information, and typically pertain to
some aspect of the EES application or its associated technical or business support processes.


4.1.7     Participation in monthly EES Change Control Board (CCB) meetings, periodic (typically weekly) system status meetings with the COTR and
      other ad hoc meetings as needed – Contractor participation on the CCB is in a non-voting member capacity, in a technical advisory role.

4.1.8     Investigation and resolution of issues with external interfaces to other FDA applications/databases – Currently, most interface issues
      that arise pertain to the EES interface with FACTS.

4.1.9     Management of batch jobs, monitoring of logs, maintenance of O&M work activity statistics (e.g. number of Customer Service Requests
per unit time) – This task is primarily comprised of routine checks to ensure that backend processes are functioning properly.  As of the
writing of this SOW, these include five batch jobs associated with tickler distribution, report distribution and monitoring and processing of
EES/FACTS interface staging table data.


4.1.10   Maintenance of O&M work activity statistics – This task involves measurement and compilation of frequency statistics for various
routine O&M activities (e.g. number of Customer Service Requests per month, number of custom query requests per month).  These statistics are
utilized by the FDA to help assess EES maintenance workload.



      The following table includes average monthly O&M work requests for the most frequent types of O&M activities, for the period of January
      2008 through December 2008.




      |Work Request Category                                           |Average No. of Requests Per Month, January 2008      |

4.1.11   Management of EES configuration – Version management of EES code and artifacts is performed using Government furnished version
      management software and processes.  Problem/Change Request management is performed using Government furnished PCR tracking software and
      processes.  (See section of this Statement of Work entitled Required Software Tools.)




Less frequent activities (more typically quarterly, semi-annually or annually):



4.1.12   Support for security related activities – This support typically assumes the form of response to requests for information on EES
      security related features, and of participation in EES Contingency Plan test exercises.  Most security related activities stem from system
      Certification and Accreditation (C&A), which must be renewed every three years and after major system modifications.  C&A is conducted by
      an independent security team.  Contingency Plan testing typically occurs once per year.  There is also the potential for required security
      related modifications to EES as a result of C&A of the system.   It is currently anticipated that EES will undergo its next C&A in the
      Spring of 2009.

4.1.13   Modifications to EES programs to correct defects

4.1.14   Testing of EES compatibility with future changes in the computing environment, possibly resulting in the need for EES modification in
      order to maintain compatibility - These changes may include such things as operating system upgrades, database version upgrades, changes to
      the FDA or CDER standard desktop image and changes to interfacing applications/databases.  Standard desktop image upgrades occur once
      quarterly.  Thus far, these changes have generally required minimal EES testing and no modification.  Other types of changes do not occur
      on a regularly scheduled or frequent basis, but have a greater potential to require more intensive testing and to necessitate additional
      action/modification in order to maintain EES compatibility with the computing environment.
4.2 EES Maintenance Releases
The contractor shall perform planning, requirements analysis, design, development, testing and implementation for periodic EES maintenance
releases composed of small to medium level-of-effort changes.  In performing these activities, the contractor shall adhere to the Department of
Health and Human Services Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (HHS EPLC) Framework, or tailoring thereof as approved by the COTR.  It is
anticipated that the degree of rigor with which the EPLC is applied will be scaled as appropriate to a maintenance release of an operational
system.

4.2.1    Planning – The contractor shall plan work activities required in order to produce EES releases.  The contractor shall coordinate with
the COTR to integrate scheduling of contractor and Government release-related activities (e.g., submission of artifacts and Government QA review
of those artifacts; submission of database scripts and installation of those scripts by the Database Administrator).


4.2.2    Requirements Analysis – The contractor shall analyze, document and manage requirements for changes that are incorporated into EES
      releases. The contractor shall maintain traceability between, at a minimum, requirements/PCRs and test cases.


4.2.3    Design – The contractor shall design changes that are incorporated into EES releases.  Where appropriate, the contractor shall document
      the design through update of existing EES design documentation or development of new documentation, as agreed to by the COTR.


4.2.4    Development – The contractor shall develop all EES code for changes that are incorporated into EES releases.  This shall include both
      frontend application code (e.g. EES forms and reports) as well as backend code (e.g., batch procedures, database scripts).


4.2.5    Testing – The contractor shall perform testing of EES releases to ensure that changes satisfy functional and non-functional release
      requirements and do not adversely impact the existing application.  The contractor shall support User Acceptance Testing (UAT) through such
      activities as creation of UAT Test Cases, preparation of testing data and response to questions from testers.  Prior to deployment into the
      production environment, the contractor shall formally test each EES release in the FDA IT Research and Development Laboratory (RDL) in the
      Enterprise Integration, Test and Evaluation Environment (EIT&E).  During this testing, the contractor shall coordinate testing schedules
      and resources with other RDL users and shall adhere to all RDL standards and procedures.  Additionally, EES releases shall be subject to
      Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V).  The contractor shall provide the IV&V team with access to any project artifacts and
      information required to conduct IV&V activities, and in general shall cooperate as needed in order to support EES IV&V.


4.2.6    Implementation – The contractor shall support implementation of EES releases by providing the application build, installation
      instructions, release notes and updated user documentation, and shall in general collaborate with the Government as needed to facilitate
      deployment.  The Government shall be responsible for deploying releases to production.



Additional requirements related to EES maintenance releases are addressed in this Statement of Work under Reporting Requirement/Delivery
Schedule.
4.3 EES Project Management and Reporting

11. 9 FDA 1335 Personnel Security Clearance Requirements

1.  BACKGROUND

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that DHHS employees
and contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have access to DHHS
equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation of some type.

Contractor employees who will be in DHHS-owned or lease space for less than thirty (30) days are exempted from the background investigation
requirement.  These contractor employees must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space.

2.  GENERAL

The contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer, ten (10) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this
contract:

   a. Certification that all required security form packets and a list of contractor    employees names for whom the requisite security
      information has been provided to Division of Security Operations, Policy and Planning, Personnel Security Staff.

   b.  "Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement" forms
         signed by each employee named in paragraph a. above.

With the exception of costs associated with fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the Government
will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the contractor.  The cost of fingerprinting Contractor employees at any
location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor.

Contractor employees shall obtain security badges in order to access to DHHS-owned or leased property without an escort. (See Section 3 for
details on the badging process)  However, in the event that work must commence before security badges can be issued, contractor employees will
be allowed onto DHHS-owned or leased property, but must be escorted at all times.

All Contractor employees who undergo a background investigation are required to log onto the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM’s) Electronic
Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) system to complete the forms necessary to initiate their background investigations.  The
forms required vary with the position risk levels for the contract.

The position risk levels for this contract are 5.

There are two (2) potential position risk levels, which are:

   a. Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1) (SEE CHART A) - Positions which involve the lowest degree of adverse impact on the efficiency of the
      Agency.  The forms set forth by CHART A are required for Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1).  Contractor employees assigned to Level 1 who
      receive a security badge will be required to provide additional security information for a background investigation as specified in
      Paragraph 5 below.


   b. Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6) (SEE CHART B) - Positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public
      confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned Government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs.  The
      forms set forth by CHART B are required for Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6).  Contractor employees assigned Levels 5 or 6 must
      receive security badge as well as a background investigation.

In order to access the e-QIP system, Contractor employees must provide the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist with the following
information:  (a) full name; (b) position title; (c) social security number; (d) date of birth; (e) place of birth; (f) email address; and (g)
phone number.  The Personnel Security Specialist will use this information to initiate each Contractor employee into the e-QIP system.  Once
this is done, each Contractor employee will receive an email that contains a web link to access the e-QIP system, as well as instructions and
additional forms needed to initiate the suitability background investigation. The Project Officer for the contract will provide the name of the
appropriate Personnel Security Specialist to the Contractor.

A Contractor’s failure to comply with the e-QIP processing guidelines will result in that Contractor’s employees being denied access to FDA
property until all security processing has been completed.


3. BADGING PROCESS

The FDA Project Officer will sponsor Contractor employees on the FDA Form 3391 for the purpose of obtaining an FDA Security Access Card.  In
order to obtain one, a contractor employee must receive a “favorable” fingerprint return.  Fingerprints must be submitted to the Personnel
Security Office at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work.   Fingerprints will be submitted in one of two ways, depending on
where the contract will be performed:



   a. Contractor employees who will work in the Washington D.C. metro area will, at the direction of the FDA Project Officer or his/her designee,
      contact the Personnel Security Branch to schedule a fingerprinting appointment, or

   b. Contractor employees who will work in a field office will submit fingerprints to:
           Food and Drug Administration
           Fingerprinting and Personnel Security Office
           10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Building 1, Room 1201
           Silver Spring, MD 20993


Upon the receipt of a “favorable” fingerprint return, each Contractor employee must present two forms of identification in order to receive his
or her badge. One form of identification must be a government-issued photo identification document.  Acceptable forms of photo identification
are referenced on the FDA Form 3391.  Acceptable forms of secondary identification are listed on the back of the I-9 Form.  This form can be
obtained at http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf

An individual who receives an unfavorable report may appeal that finding by submitting a written request to the Personnel Security Staff.,

4.  BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS

The Government shall conduct an additional background investigation for those individuals named to risk Levels 1, 5 and 6 serving under this
contract.

Required background investigations may include, but not be limited to:

1. Review of prior Government/military personnel records;
2. Review of FBI records and fingerprint files;
3. Searches of credit bureaus;
4. Personal interviews; and
5. Written inquiries covering the subject's background.

Background investigations will be conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of contract performance is maintained pending completion of all appropriate
background investigations of contractor employees.

The Contractor shall submit the information required for eQIP access and other requisite forms for the risk level(s) specified. In addition, the
contractor shall provide a cover letter which includes:  the Contractor's name, the contract number, the name of the Contracting Officer
administering the contract, the names of all Contractor employees' for whom a background check is required and those employees’ social security
numbers, dates of birth, and former names. This cover letter and all completed forms shall be transmitted, in a separate sealed envelope marked,
"TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY," to:

Food and Drug Administration
Badging and Credentialing Office
10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Building 1, Room 1201
Silver Spring, MD 20993

The contractor shall send a separate letter to the Contracting Officer that includes the contract number and employee names.

The contractor shall advise its prospective employees that all standard forms submitted to the FDA will be forwarded to the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) for scheduling background investigations.

Personnel Security Staff will resolve with the contract employee any issues arising out of inaccurate or incomplete forms.

Employees who have been previously granted a Government security clearance shall advise Personnel Security Staff of the details of such
clearances to determine if a previous clearance level is suitable for the current FDA position.

At any time, if a contractor employee for whom security forms have been submitted is terminated or otherwise ceases work under the contract, the
contractor shall immediately notify Personnel Security Staff, in writing, with copies to the respective FDA Project and Contracting Officers.

The OPM background investigation will take approximately 120 days.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing if an employee
is denied a clearance.  Those individuals who have been cleared by Personnel Security Staff may continue to work under the contract.  Those who
are not cleared must cease work on the contract immediately.

If a Contractor employee changes job responsibilities under this contract, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, and the
Government will make a determination whether an additional security clearance is required.

In the event that a cleared individual is replaced, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and comply with all requirements of this
clause, as specified herein, prior to the commencement of work by the replacement individual.

The Contractor shall be responsible for the return of any Government issued security badges to the Project Officer.

6.  NON-PUBLIC DATA PROTECTION

The contractor shall protect the privacy of all information reported by or about contract employees and shall protect against unauthorized
disclosure.

                                                     CHARTS A & B ARE APPENDED TO THIS CLAUSE
