M00264-13-R-0047 Page 13 of 77 Section C - Descriptions and Specifications PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) FOR THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (EMIMS)

1.0

INTRODUCTION

The US Marine Corps (USMC) has a requirement for an internet accessible emergency management incident management system that provides coordination with civilian response and recovery partners. This application shall provide MCICOM with the ability to standardize emergency management incident coordination and to ensure compliance with Department of Defense (DoD) and USMC policies and satisfy reporting and documentation requirements. Additionally, EMIMS shall support access to important emergency management decision-making information including near real-time access to local, regional, and national weather trends, satellite images, mapping information, details of operations and resource status within the USMC and partner civilian jurisdictions, and near real-time information sharing. MCICOM will deploy the application to each of the following six (6) sites in various regions: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Marine Corps Base Quantico (Quantico, Virginia) Marine Corps Installations Command ­ Henderson Hall (Arlington, Virginia) Marine Corps Installations East ­ Camp Lejeune (Jacksonville, North Carolina) Marine Corps Installations West ­ Camp Pendleton (Oceanside, California) Marine Corps Installations Pacific ­ Camp Smedley D. Butler (Naha, Japan) Marine Corps Base Hawaii ­ Camp H. M. Smith (Aiea, Hawaii)

1.1 Scope This Performance Work Statement (PWS) sets forth the work efforts required for support and enhancements to the Emergency Management Incident Management System (EMIMS). The scope of this effort shall encompass the following: ˇ Information Assurance ˇ Web-based System Access ˇ Information Sharing ˇ Disaster Recovery ˇ Mapping Capability ˇ Maintenance and Training ˇ Program Management 1.2 Expected Outcome The Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (DC I&L) and Commander, Marine Corps Installations Command (MCICOM) expect to gain efficient, high quality, customer-oriented contractor technical support for all EMIMS users located worldwide. Contracting for these services will allow I&L and MCICOM staff to focus on providing improved emergency management services to the Commander, MCICOM, Regional Installations Commanders, Commanders at Marine Corps Installations, and Marines and their families, while at the same time, reducing cost through innovative applications by the contractor. Although these organizations have different mission structures, for purposes of this PWS the term MCICOM will be used to refer to the senior stakeholders and policy authority for the emergency management incident management system used throughout Marine Corps installations including both regional commanders and supported Training and Education Command (TECOM) installations. 1.3 Assumptions The assumptions listed below apply to this requirement:

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 14 of 77 ˇ ˇ MCICOM staff has determined that requests for assistance and problem resolution support for all installation emergency management operations customers will be sustained at current or higher levels. The current and future emergency management operations are increasing in complexity in the area of information collection and data sharing and require advanced technical skills to meet the expected high levels of customer service.

1.4 General Information ˇ A U.S. Government employee, Program Manager, shall be assigned to the contractor team to provide oversight and analysis of the effort, and the team shall include expert personnel with experience and knowledge of performing information assurance, analysis, COTS adaptation, integration, training, and testing. ˇ EMIMS is considered to be Mission Assurance Category (MAC) III system with a Confidentiality Level as described in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 8500.2 of Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU). ˇ In accordance with FAR 37.114(c): "All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials ... (Contractor personnel) must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed." 1.5 Applicable Documents Applicable documents will be listed throughout the PWS to the extent specified herein. The most recent revision of the referenced document at the time of contract shall be used unless otherwise specified or directed by the Contracting Officer. Subject to Contracting Officer direction, in the event of conflict between the applicable documents and this PWS, the PWS shall take precedence. Nothing in this document, however, supersedes applicable laws and regulations unless a specific exemption has been obtained. 2.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Current USMC emergency management incident management efforts consist of disparate systems supported and funded at the Installation level that are increasingly unable to meet expanding needs and requirements. Existing methods include commercial off the shelf (COTS) web-based applications. A uniform approach is needed to address these issues, and allow MCICOM to implement a standardized emergency management incident coordination application that provides a common incident management capability and supports interoperability with all internal and external emergency management response partners. 3.0 DELIVERABLES

Deliverables are described through-out the PWS. Where deliverable documents are required the contractor shall provide one original in hardcopy form. The contractor shall maintain an electronic copy; of each deliverable on a shared drive of the MCICOM LAN that is accessible to the MCICOM staff. This drive will contain a separate directory established as a repository for all deliverables. Deliverables must incorporate Government review comments for acceptance. The Government will have ten (10) working days to review deliverables and provide comments. The Contractor shall have five (5) working days to respond to or incorporate Government comments. For the EMIMS to be accepted, it must have successfully completed the test scenarios outlined in the Test Plan, all tasks must have been completed, all deliverables have been provided in the format and media required by the Government, all deliverables will be provided in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7020, and the system must have met the general requirements as stated herein. 4.0 INFORMATION ASSURANCE (IA)

4.1.1 Scope. The scope of this effort is to provide independent Information Assurance support for MCICOM. The scope of this activity includes the planning, review, reporting, tracking and management of Information Assurance (IA) documentation and the technical analysis of the MCICOM information system IA Certification and Accreditation (C&A) posture against DoD, US Department of Navy and Marine Corps security standards. Key

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 15 of 77 support requirements require an understanding and application of the following: DoDI 8510.01 DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), DoD 8500.2 IA control compliance requirements, Defense Information System Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), NIST IA control compliance requirements, and management of IA testing related activities consistent with program ACAT levels, milestone schedules, and overarching policy requirements. 4.1.2 Background. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in coordination with the National Security Agency (NSA) and other Department of Defense (DoD) activities has developed a standard process to minimize the risks associated with non-standard security implementation across shared infrastructures and end systems. Information Assurance is the means used to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-repudiation in accordance with DoD Directive 8500.1 Information Assurance; DoD Instruction 8500.2 Information Assurance Implementation; DoDI 8510.01 DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP); the Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/3 and Joint DoD Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS)/Cryptologic Sensitive Compartmented Information Systems Security Standards (JDCSISSS); and National Security Agency (NSA)/Central Security Service Information System Certification and Accreditation Process (NISCAP). The goal of IA is to integrate security directly into the system lifecycle and to apply it uniformly across DoD. The IA documentation package is a living document that captures and maintains security information related to the C&A of a system/application ensuring compliance in accordance with previously stated directives/processes/guides lines. The IA package captures the topology, configuration, risk assessment, vulnerability assessment, and other pertinent security related information necessary to provide the Designated Approval Authority (DAA) assurance that system security and operational risks have been mitigated. The IA package is reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and compliance. This review comprises a thorough analysis of all IA controls both technical and non-technical associated with the system/application as it relates to Federal, National, DoD, DON and Marine Corps policy and standards. 4.1.3 General Requirements. Within the scope of this effort, the Contractor provides IA documentation planning, preparation and review support, technical expertise support; and general IA process management support to MCICOM to obtain and maintain Authorization to Operate (ATO) for the MCICOM emergency management incident management system application that is proposed. 4.1.4 Information Assurance Controls. The Contractor will provide documentation of compliance with appropriate DoD 8500.2 IA controls associated with the system and information in the tasks under this Requirement. This is necessary to ensure the integrity and independence of the work performed under this contract. 4.1.5 Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI). Currently there are no known organizational conflicts of interest associated with this requirement. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) and Confidential Financial Disclosure Reports (OGE Form 450) will be required from all participants involved in the Source Selection process to identify any possible OCI's. Additionally, all interested parties shall be required to identify any/all OCI's and provide a mitigation plan as part of their proposal submission. The requiring activity shall be instructed that the Contracting Officer should be informed of any real or potential OCI once it is discovered. In accordance with FAR 9.505-4: "A contractor that gains access to proprietary information of other companies in performing advisory and assistance services for the Government must agree with the other companies to protect their information from unauthorized use of disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished." The contractor shall furnish copies of these agreements to the contracting officer, who shall confirm that they are properly executed. 4.1.6 Maintain Staff Certifications. The Contractor shall ensure that personnel accessing information systems have the proper and current information assurance certification to perform information assurance functions in accordance with DoD 8570.01-M Change 1, Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program. The Contractor shall meet the applicable information assurance certification requirements, including: ˇ DoD-approved information assurance workforce certifications appropriate for each category and level as listed in the current version of DoD 8570.01-M; and

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 16 of 77 ˇ Appropriate operating system certification for information assurance technical positions as required by DoD 8570.01-M. Upon request by the Government, the Contractor shall provide documentation supporting the information assurance certification status of personnel performing information assurance functions.

Contractor personnel who do not have proper and current certifications shall be denied access to DoD information and systems for the purpose of performing information assurance functions. In addition to the DoD 8570.01-M Change 1 requirements, the Contractor will ensure that Contractor personnel assigned to review or support tasks associated with a particular system have sufficient technical knowledge and experience to properly evaluate system compliance or perform required support on the technologies present in the system. 4.1.7 Maintain MCCAST Account. The Contractor is required to obtain and maintain an MCCAST account to support the IA process for the proposed application. 4.1.8 Specific Requirements. Specific requirements and duties for the period of performance are heavily based on DoD IA requirements, Department of Navy (DON) guidelines, and Marine Corps directives. The main effort under this contract is based primarily on the specific tasks and duties identified in the DON DIACAP handbook, version 1, dated 15 July 2008 as well as the specific IA status of the proposed application. The capability to perform all IA specific tasks identified in the DON DIACAP handbook for these systems/applications is critical. However, the scope of this effort will also include general process management support of the overall process. Process steps listed in Chapter 6 of the DON DIACAP handbook should be used as the basis for the Contractor proposal for the specific requirements. Process management and items described below should be based heavily on the process identified in Chapter 6 of the DON DIACAP handbook. 4.1.9 Certification and Accreditation (C&A). C&A support will be the primary focus of this support contract. The Contractor is expected to have the knowledge and expertise to function as key support throughout the DIACAP process, as described in the DON DIACAP handbook. The primary area of responsibility under this task is initial DIACAP planning, plan development, and approval of the DIACAP Implementation Plan (DIP). In collaboration with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) , the Contractor will be responsible for the non-inherently governmental tasks identified in section 6.2 of the DON DIACAP Handbook. The contractor shall have the necessary C&A expertise to coordinate and carry out effective DIACAP planning and development and obtain necessary approvals. 4.1.10 Independent Verification and Validation. Independent Verification and Validation will be the secondary focus of the IA process. The Contractor will be responsible for the non-inherently governmental tasks identified in section 6.3 of the DON DIACAP Handbook and the Contractor is expected to develop and maintain the capability to perform requisite test planning activities required to support explicit independent DIACAP verification and validation tasks. Primarily test planning activities will consist of the development of test scenarios, verification of qualifications for assigned evaluators, and scheduling of test events. The Contractor will review the IA Control (IAC) implementation plan, validation plan, and procedures for MCICOM IS's, as assigned by the Government. The Contractor will verify the validation plan and procedures are appropriate for the system under review and are comprehensive and complete to ensure that all assigned IACs identified in the system's DIACAP Implementation Plan (DIP) can be validated as compliant or non-compliant. The Contractor will provide verified procedures and tasks and carry out validation testing. Individual tasks and process steps for these activities are contained in 6.3.1.2 through 6.3.1.2.2 of the DoN DIACAP Handbook. To complete these tasks the contractor will receive a DIACAP package with required IA controls identified and artifacts containing detailed system information, a DIACAP Implementation Plan (DIP), and a draft validation plan with draft validation procedures prepared by the Program Manager/MCICOM Government Lead. Once validation of the validation plan and procedures are completed, the Contractor will provide a validated test plan and artifacts and proceed with IA testing. The Contractor will carry out test events and ensure proper and complete execution of test activities.

H-1.2 The Contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in the contract, the Contractor does not have any organizational conflict of interest(s) as defined in this section. It is recognized that the effort to be performed by the Contractor under this contract may create a potential organizational conflict of interest on the instant contractor or on a future acquisition. In order to avoid this potential conflict of interest, and at the same time to avoid prejudicing the best interest of the Government, the right of the Contractor to participate in future procurement of equipment and/or services that are subject of any work under this contract shall be limited as described below in accordance with the requirements of FAR 9.5. H-1.3 The Contractor agrees that it shall not release, disclose, or use in any way that would permit or result in disclosure to any party outside the Government any information provided to the Contractor by the Government during or as a result of performance of this contract. Such information includes, but is not limited to, information submitted to the Government on a confidential basis by other persons. Further, the prohibition against release of Government provided information extends to cover such information whether or not in its original form, e.g., where the information has been included in Contractor generated work order or where it is discernible from materials incorporating or based upon such information. This prohibition shall not expire after a given period of time. H-1.4 The Contractor agrees that it shall not release, disclose, or use in any way that would permit or result in disclosure to any party outside the Government any information generated, provided, or derived during or as a result of performance of this contract. This prohibition shall expire after a period of three years after completion of performance of this contract. H-1.5 The prohibitions contained within this section shall apply with equal force to any affiliate of the Contractor, any subcontractor, consultant, or employee of the Contractor, any joint venture involving the Contractor, any entity into or with which it may merge or affiliate, or any successor or assign of the Contractor. The terms of this Special Contract Requirement relating to notification shall apply to any release of information in contravention of this section. H-1.6 The Contractor further agrees that, during the performance of this contract and for a period three years after completion of performance of this contract, the Contractor agrees that it will not supply as a prime contractor, subcontractor at any tier, or consultant to a supplier to the Department of Defense, any product, service, or major component of an item or service, which was the subject of the specifications and/or work statements furnished under this contract. This exclusion does not apply to any re-competition for those systems, components or services furnished pursuant to this contract. The Contractor shall, within 15 days after the effective date of this contract, provide, in writing, the Contracting Officer, a representation that all employees, agents, and subcontractors involved in the performance of this contract have been informed of the provisions of this clause. Any subcontractor that performs any work relative to this contract shall be subject to this clause. The Contractor agrees to place in each subcontract affected by these provisions the necessary language contained in this clause. H-1.7 The Contractor agrees, that, if after award, it discovers an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, it shall make immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. The notification shall include a description of the actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, a description of the action which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict, and any other relevant information that would assist the Contracting Officer in making a determination on this matter. Notwithstanding

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 32 of 77 this notification, the Government may terminate the contract for the convenience of the Government if determined to be in the best interest of the Government. H-1.8 If the Contractor was aware, or should have been aware, of an organizational conflict of interest prior to the award of this contract or becomes, or should become, aware of an organizational conflict of interest after award of this contract and does not make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate this contract for default. H-1.9 If the Contractor takes any action prohibited by this requirement or fails to take action required by this requirement, the Government may terminate this contract for default. H-1.10 The Contracting Officer's decision as to the existence or nonexistence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest shall be final. H-1.11 The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, if it has been tasked to evaluate or advise the Government concerning its own products or activities or those of a competitor in order to ensure proper safeguards exist to guarantee objectivity and to protect the Government's interest. H-1.12 The Contractor shall include this requirement in subcontracts of any tier which involve access to information or situations/conditions covered by the preceding paragraphs, substituting "subcontractor" for "contractor" where appropriate. H-1.13 The rights and remedies described herein shall not be exclusive and are in addition to other rights and remedies provided by law or elsewhere included in this contract. Compliance with this requirement is a material requirement of this contract. H-2 Obtaining Access to Proprietary Information. In accordance with FAR 9.505-4(b). A contractor that gains access to proprietary information of other companies in performing advisory and assistance services for the Government must agree with the other companies to protect their information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. The contracting officer shall obtain copies of these agreements and ensure that they are properly executed.

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 44 of 77 Section J - List of Documents, Exhibits and Other Attachments ATTACHMENTS 1. QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)

ATTACHMENT 1 QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN 1. Objective. This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) serves as the principal basis for assessing overall performance quality associated with this effort. This document will be used by the Government to assess the effectiveness of the Contractor's management and technical services. This QASP provides the methodology by which the Contractor's performance will be monitored to determine compliance with established performance objectives and to establish performance benchmarks that ensure a quantifiable basis for measuring effectiveness. The plan is designed so that surveillance is limited to that which is necessary to verify the Contractor is performing management and technical services satisfactorily and relates directly to performance of the objectives delineated in the PWS. 2. Government Surveillance. The Government will identify an individual to function as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for this task, and her/his authority will be limited to administering specific technical aspects of the contract. The COR will not provide direction that is outside the scope of responsibilities delineated under this task order. The designated individual will: ˇ Maintain a detailed knowledge of the technical requirements of the contract ˇ Document Contractor performance in accordance with the QASP ˇ Identify and immediately forward notifications of deficient, or non-compliant performance to the Contracting Officer ˇ Approve priorities of support, resources, and associated schedules 3. Surveillance Methods. Surveillance of Contractor performance is the method used by the COR to determine whether the Contractor is effectively and efficiently complying with all terms and conditions of the task order. In addition to statistical analysis, the functional expertise of the COR plays a critical role in adequately evaluating Contractor performance. The below listed methods of surveillance shall be used in the administration of this QASP and the standards are delineated by the element in the Performance Requirements Survey (PRS) table listed below: Demonstration. A qualification method that is carried out by operation and relies on observable functional operation. It does not require the use of instrumentation or special test equipment; Analysis. A qualification method that is carried out by examining and assessing the application of techniques in order to determine if they are appropriate and sufficient. The quality of performance can be determined from Government or Contractor task-based or Management Information System (MIS) reports; Contractor ISO 9000 techniques and procedures; or from Government observation of completed tasks. In some instances, reports may be available in the form of information on a Contractor's performance against contract requirements. Reports generally provide information regarding various characteristics of tasks and can, therefore, be used to determine acceptability of a Contractor's performance. Inspections. Qualitative inspections can be accomplished through one of the following techniques: ˇ Random or Stratified Sampling: With random sampling, services are sampled to determine if the level of performance is acceptable. Random sampling works best when the number of instances of the services being performed is very large and a statistically valid sample can be obtained. Stratified sampling focuses on selected parts of total Contractor output for sampling. Computer programs may be available to assist in establishing sampling procedures. ˇ Periodic Inspection, Judgmental Inspection, or Planned Sampling: This method, sometimes called "planned sampling," consists of the evaluation of tasks selected on other than a 100% or random basis.

4. Performance Requirements. The performance requirements set forth in this section correspond to the PWS paragraphs delineated in the table. Enclosure (1) of this document provides standards for performance for specific requirements: Financial and Business Analysis Support. The Contractor will be evaluated on the effectiveness of their execution and support strategy, inclusive of efficiency of processes, product quality, and compliance with deadlines Management & Administration. The Contractor will be evaluated on the quality of their overall technical management strategy; ability to preclude or resolve issues; and effectiveness of their use of resources to meet planning goals and schedules.

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 55 of 77 falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contracting Officer shall perform a price proposal analysis to determine fair and reasonable pricing. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to reject an offer if it is determined that

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 70 of 77 the lack of balanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government in accordance with FAR Part 15.404-1(g). All items covered under option years may be ordered and performed during the scheduled period of performance of this contract. Offerors are required to provide prices for these items under option years. The prices for all option items will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options. The U.S. Government makes no guarantee that the option years will be exercised. It will be the U.S. Government's unilateral right to exercise the option years. Once the option is exercised, the offeror is required to perform the work when ordered during the scheduled period of performance of this contract. Offerors should note that FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services clause is included in this Solicitation. The Government will evaluate this potential option to extend services by adding six (6) months of the Offeror's final option period price to the Offeror's total evaluated price. Offerors are notified that the Government may choose to use the Option to Extend Services clause at the completion of any performance period. The price for the exercise of any portion of the available six months will be derived from the prices in effect at the end of the current performance period. Offeror's pricing should reflect the potential exercise of the Extension of Services option at FAR 21.217-8, Option to Extend Services, keeping in mind that this solicitation is competitive and should reflect the Offeror's most competitive price and terms. The fully developed technical solution and corresponding grand total price for each function area established in the CLIN structure of Section B of the solicitation should be clearly annotated in the proposal. No ambiguities of inclusion, exclusion, or content shall be extended and lack of content or clarity with regard to pricing shall be considered as representing a "non-responsive" offer.

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 73 of 77 Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, and are in descending order of importance: Factor 1: Technical Capability; Factor 2: Past Performance; Factor 3: Price. This acquisition will utilize the trade-off procedures to achieve the best-value for the Government. Award will be made to the acceptable Offeror whose offer represents the best-value for the Government, which is deemed responsible in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certification, and other information required by this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. In determining the best overall response, Factor 1, Technical Capability is significantly more important than Factor 2, Past Performance. Factor 1, Technical Capability and Factor 2, Past Performance are significantly more important than Factor 3, Price. Although price is the least important factor, it becomes increasingly important when Offerors receive similar ratings for the non-priced factors. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M­1 AWARD BASED ON BEST VALUE COST/TECHNICAL TRADEOFF TO THE GOVERNMENT M-1.1 The Government will award to the offeror whose proposal offers the best-value in terms of Technical Capability; Past Performance; and Price as prescribed in Section M-3 of this solicitation. Within the best value continuum, the Government may employ a Cost/Technical Tradeoff analysis of cost or price and non-cost factors (FAR 15.101-1) in evaluating the proposals submitted. M-1.2 Proposals will be assessed for how well the Offeror's proposal meets or exceeds the solicitation requirements and the risks associated with the Offeror's approach. Determining how well the Offeror's proposal meets the solicitation requirements will be accomplished in two steps. First, a determination will be made if the Offeror's proposal meets or exceeds the solicitation requirements. Next, the discriminators will be identified for the proposals reflecting the unique strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiencies of each offer. In addition, the Government will examine the impact of each discriminator and assess its relative value to the Government.

M-1.3 In order to make a sound selection decision, the Government needs to understand the ways in which a given proposal is considered technically strong, as well as the ways in which it is weak or deficient. Hence, a catalog of the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies (in terms of the evaluation criteria) facilitates the process of determining which proposal presents the best overall value to the Government. M­2 BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD M-2.1 Unless all offers are rejected, award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered. In determining the best overall response, Factor 1, Technical Capability is significantly more important than Factor 2, Past Performance; and Factor 2, Past Performance is more important than Factor 3, Price. Factor 1, Technical Capability and Factor 2, Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 3, Price. Although PRICE is the least important factor, it becomes increasingly important when Offerors receive similar ratings for the non-priced factors. Prospective Offerors are forewarned that a proposal meeting solicitation requirements with the lowest evaluated price may not be selected if award to a higher evaluated priced offeror is determined to be most advantageous to the Government. If proposed prices are considered unreasonable, greater risk will be assessed, and the Government may infer a lack of understanding of the requirements. M-2.2 The government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract upon initial proposals, therefore, the Offerors initial proposal shall contain the Offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, is determined to provide the "best-value" to the government. M-2.4 Options. The price for the base year and option years will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). M­3 EVALUATION FACTORS AND RATING METHODOLOGY M-3.1 EVALUATION FACTORS M-3.1.1 Factor 1 ­ Technical Capability: This factor will evaluate the Offeror's knowledge and understanding of the requirements by specifically evaluating: 3.1.1.1 The Offeror's understanding of the technical and programmatic requirements outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS); 3.1.1.2 The Offeror's understanding of all the requirements and subsections stated in the "Deliverables Descriptions" of the PWS; 3.1.1.3 The techniques used to provide independent Information Assurance support for MCICOM; 3.1.1.4 The Offeror's means of providing continuous support to MCICOM consistent with the activities identified in table 1 of the PWS; 3.1.1.5 The Offeror's documentation of compliance with appropriate DOD 8500.2 IA controls that are associated with the system and information of this requirement;

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 75 of 77 3.1.1.6 The Offeror's capability of maintaining staff certifications in accordance with DoD 8570.01-M Change 1, Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, and providing records upon request throughout the contract period; 3.1.1.7 The Offeror's capability of obtaining and maintaining MCCAST accounts; 3.1.1.8 The Offeror's methods and procedures for performing and executing the "Preparatory Phase", "Execution Phase", and "Risk Analysis Phase"; 3.1.1.9 The Offeror's procedures used to perform "Verification and Validation Support", "Security Engineering Support", and "Operations Support"; 3.1.1.10 The Offeror's ability to provide subject matter expert representation in accordance with the description stated in the PWS; 3.1.1.11 The Offeror's ability to adequately identify a suitable level of technical understanding of the issues. This includes, at a minimum, describing contract level performance objectives that can be accomplished by their technical approach; describe the benefits and advantages of that approach; and effectively illustrate the roles of staff and team resources to execute the intended strategy; 3.1.1.12 The Offeror's management and administrations approach suitable to respond to the types of requirements delineated in the PWS, consistent with their technical approach; and 3.1.1.13 The Offeror's ability to adequately define an effective management approach complementary to the proposed technical solution set forth in response to the criteria in the PWS. At a minimum, this includes identifying responsibilities and roles of team members in attaining performance objectives; describing the processes and quality measures associated with executing the strategy; and illustrating the roles of staff and team resources relevant to the approach so as to ensure suitable oversight and control of performance execution. Collectively, the integrated approach must demonstrate to the evaluator that the Offeror possesses the capabilities and resources to establish and operate an efficient organization that is both responsive and flexible to meet the requirements. Roles of management and other key staff are annotated and provisions for independent, objective quality assurance (e.g., customer surveys, etc.) are incorporated. Measures for immediate action and remediation are noted in the discussion so as to ensure the quality of contract deliverables and timeliness of service delivery. Key considerations include process maturity, roles of responsible staff, degree of WBS integration, and controls at both the corporate and contract level under performance-based operating parameters. The offers will be evaluated on the Offeror's ability to demonstrate a sound understanding of the technical nature of the work requirements. The proposal must provide the evaluation panel with sufficient confidence that the Offeror has the capacity to support the identified mission area, understands the priorities and emerging issues within those areas. The technical ratings are defined below: Rating Outstanding Description Offer meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. Offer meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Offer contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.

Good

M00264-13-R-0047 Page 76 of 77 Offer meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. Marginal Offer does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The offer has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. Unacceptable Offer does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Offer is unawardable. Note: A proposal that received an "Unacceptable" rating for Factor 1 will result in the entire proposal being determined "unacceptable". No further evaluation of the proposal shall be performed and the Offeror will not be considered for award. M-3.1.2 Factor 2 ­ Past Performance: Past Performance: This factor will evaluate the Offeror's ability to perform successfully based on their relevant past performance history by specifically evaluating: ˇ The Offeror's past references and quality of service; and ˇ The Offeror's references as related to this requirement. There are two (2) aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate the Offeror's Past Performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the Offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection. The following table reflects the Past Performance Relevancy Ratings: Rating Definition Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and Relevant complexities this solicitation requires. Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the Contractor performed on the contracts. The following table reflects the Past Performance Confidence Assessments: Rating Definition Substantial Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high Confidence expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a Confidence reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Limited Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low Confidence expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No Confidence Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No recent/relevant performance record is available or the Offeror's performance record Unknown is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably Confidence assigned.

Price, while being an important factor, is not in and of itself the determining factor in the selection of the successful offeror for award of the contract contemplated by this solicitation. Price is not scored; rather, each Offeror's price will be evaluated for realism, reasonableness, and completeness and accuracy of the proposed contract price. A price analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b). M­3.1.3.2 Reasonableness. The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of proposed price for the option periods by assessing the acceptability of the Offeror's methodology used in developing the price estimates. For the price to be reasonable in its nature and amount, it should not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of a competitive business. Reasonableness takes into account the context of a given source selection, including current market conditions and other factors that affect the ability of an offeror to perform the contract requirements. Reasonableness depends upon a variety of considerations and circumstances, including: ˇ ˇ ˇ Whether it is the type of price generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the Offeror's business or of the contract performance; Generally accepted sound business practices, Federal and State laws and regulations, etc.; and Any significant deviations from the Offeror's established practices.

M­3.1.3.3 Completeness and Accuracy. M-3.1.3.3.1 Price proposals shall be evaluated for completeness and accuracy by assessing the responsiveness of the proposed price, by assessing the level of detail of the offeror-provided price data for all requirements in the PWS, and assessing the traceability of estimates. For the cost data to be complete, the offeror, or its subcontractors, must provide all the data necessary to support the offer. The amount of data needed may vary depending on the requirements. M-3.1.3.3.2 The Offeror's proposal will be checked for mathematical correctness to include the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Checking arithmetic in all Section B-Table computations; Making sure that all prices/costs are summarized correctly; Comparing electronic submittals with any hard copies submitted; and Offeror must sign the SF1449, acknowledge all amendments, include a compliance matrix, and a Table of Contents corresponding to their price submission.
