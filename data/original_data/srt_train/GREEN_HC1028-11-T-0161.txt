52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.
(End of clause)

(a)  An offeror shall identify in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, any potential or actual Organizational and Consultant
Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) as described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  This includes actual or potential conflicts of interests of proposed
subcontractors.  If an offeror identifies in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, a potential or actual conflict of interests the
offeror shall submit an Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest Plan (OCCIP) to the contracting officer.  The OCCIP shall describe
how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future
conflicts of interest.

(b)  Offerors must consider whether their involvement and participation raises any OCCI issues, especially in the following areas when:

     (1)  Providing systems engineering and technical direction.

     (2)  Preparing specifications or work statements and/or objectives.

     (3)  Providing evaluation services.

(c)  If a prime contractor or subcontractor breaches any of the OCCI restrictions, or does not disclose or misrepresents any relevant facts
concerning its conflict of interest, the government may take appropriate action, including terminating the contract, in additional to any
remedies that may be otherwise permitted by the contract or operation of law.

                                                                 (End of clause)

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal

these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in

SECTION 508
Section 508 Requirements

      a.  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies acquiring Electronic and Information
      Technology (EIT) to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to
      the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.


      b.  All EIT procured under this contract/order must meet the following 36 CFR     1194 accessibility standards.  The full text of the
      accessibility standards is available at: http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm


            _x_ 1194.21 – Software Applications and Operating Systems
           ___ 1194.22 – Web Based Intranet and Internet Information and
                       Applications
            ___ 1194.23 – Telecommunications Products
            ___ 1194.24 – Video and Multimedia
            ___ 1194.25 – Self-Contained, Closed Products
            ___ 1194.26 – Desktop and Portable Computers
            _x_ 1194.31 – Functional Performance Criteria

      c.  The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology
      device(s), but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and device(s) so that it can be made accessible if so required
      in the future.


      d.  Contractors may propose products or services that result in substantially equivalent or greater access to and use by individuals with
      disabilities; this is known as equivalent facilitation.

                                                            JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
                                              TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

|Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of   |
|the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(*)(*).  (* Insert the appropriate statutory authority (exception) |
|permitting other than full and open competition.  Use only one exception per J&A).                                                            |

                                                                  JUSTIFICATION

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1))

Agency:
Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA)
HQ DeCA/CI
1300 E Avenue
Ft. Lee, VA 23801-1800

Contracting Activity:
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
DISA/DITCO/PL8321
2300 East Drive
Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406


2.  Nature/Description of Action(s):  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2))

The Defense Commissary Agency request approval to issue a sole source order to Micro Focus rather than full and open competition.  The DeCA
Interactive Business System (DIBS) is a critical enterprise system for the Agency.  DIBS use a COBOL compiler with Oracle interface drivers as
essential elements of the basic system design.  In 1997, DeCA selected ACUCOBOL and the related ACUCORP, Inc. (now Micro Focus) supporting
services and software to implement the design to provide the interface with the Oracle database.  Additionally, these products supported the
migration of DIBS to a Y2K compliant baseline.

Now fifteen years later, the Micro Focus products embedded in the DIBS design require upgrades to ensure that the system remains supportable.
In addition, these upgraded products will support the initiative to convert all the WFORMS (screen forms designed by third party software) into
web-based screens.  This will alleviate the need for third party software and bring system in compliance with operating system upgrades and
patches and possible licensing issues.



3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3))
DeCA requires software upgrades and technical support of the Micro Focus products.


4.  Identification of Statutory Authority:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4); Citations and Exception Descriptions are located at FAR 6.302-1/DFAR 206.302-1 –
Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency Requirements.  The use of Micro Focus  products and
services are necessary for the continued support and operations of DIBS.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor’s Unique Qualifications:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5))
It is not practical or cost effective to move to another complier and COBOL to ORACLE interface.  This would require the Agency to recompile the
DIBS programs and develop new interfaces to the ORACLE database.  DeCA would then have to re-test and re-certify the DIBS baseline.  The DIBS
System contains 1000 COBOL programs consisting of more than two million lines of code.  DIBS is a legacy system and will eventually be replaced
by the Enterprise Business System (EBS), thus trying to minimize the amount of new development to a legacy system.  The initial EBS contract has
not been awarded which requires DeCA to maintain and sustain the DIBS legacy system and to keep it supportable.  To switch to another complier
at this time would be not be cost effective.  The cost would be in the millions of dollars to re-write the entire DIBS system into a new
environment without any enhancements.    We are now required to upgrade to the next version of ACUCOBOL to meet the Information Assurance
Requirements and the Agency Oracle Platform.  Currently, our ACUCOBOL version will not work with the current DeCA Oracle Platform version, hence
we need to upgrade to get us in compliance.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6))  This will be synopsized.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7))
The cost to maintain the maintenance from Micro Focus is fair and reasonable.  DeCA would have to compare the cost of an annual maintenance
against the cost of changing to a new platform that would have to interface with all the DeCA legacy systems.  This cost would be in the
millions to start over.

8.  Description of Market Research:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(8))
No other firms were identified that had the requisite expertise and knowledge of the requirements and there are no resellers of this product.
This product is proprietary.

9.  Any Other Supporting Facts:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))

10.  Listing of Interested Sources:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10))  Microfocus

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition:  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11))
DeCA relies on Legacy Systems that require COBOL.  Until all the Legacy systems can be switched over to the new systems (5 years), DeCA will
require COBOL to maintain the systems and code.

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule:  (DARS 6.303-2(a)(S-90))
Delivery immediately upon award; NLT 30 days after award.

13.  Reference to the Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)/Program Plan (PP):  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(S-91))  N/A.
