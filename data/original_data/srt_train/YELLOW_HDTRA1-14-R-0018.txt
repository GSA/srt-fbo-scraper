_____________________________________________________________________________ _______ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans. Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.81 per hour computed on the

basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract. VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to

ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

_____________________________________________________________________________ _______ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans. Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.81 per hour computed on the

basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract. VACATION: 1 week paid vacation after 6 months of service with a contractor or successor; 2 weeks after 1 year, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 10 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. OCCUPATION NOTES: Laundry, Drycleaning, Pressing and Related Occupations: The rates for the occupations in this category applies to Napa and Solano counties only. See Wage Determination 1981-1168 for the wage rates and fringe benefits for Sonoma county. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"

materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order

proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

Purpose of Contract: The contractor, to be determined, has a requirement to provide Administrative Support. This support includes the administrative services described in the basic contract Performance Work Statement (PWS). The requirement is to provide these services in compliance with applicable regulatory guidance. The effective date of the contract is from February 23, 2015 for a base period of one year with four consecutive one-year renewable options thus possibly extending the period of performance to February 22, 2020. 2. Review Responsibilities: The DTRA requiring Offices will designate a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for each Task Order on this contract. The COR, is responsible for interfacing with the contractor in the performance of duties such as those set forth below. 3. Methods and Frequency:

3.1 Surveillance will be accomplished in several methods, random basis, weekly, monthly, quarterly and bi-annual reviews. The method used for evaluation will be based upon document reviews, reports, observation, and received customer feedback. 3.2. Timely feedback to the contractor on unacceptable performance will be provided in writing by the COR. 3.3. A summary of any performances that did not meet the terms and conditions of the contract shall be prepared by the COR and forwarded to the Contracting Officer (KO). 3.4. The surveillance report and a summary of the surveillance logs will be prepared by the COR and submitted to the KO annually. The COR may submit out-of-cycle reports to the KO to support claims of unacceptable performance or when there is a significant change in performance that alters the assessment in one or more evaluation areas. 4. Performance Areas:

If a Quality Assessment Surveillance Plan (QASP) and Surveillance Delivery Summary / Performance Surveillance Checklist is provided in a Task Order, those specific tasks will be surveilled and evaluated as described, however, all performance areas and all services described in the basic contract PWS and provided on Task Orders are subject to inspection and evaluation at any time.

5.

Evaluation Criteria:  Exceptional: Indicates performance clearly exceeds contractual requirements. The area of evaluation contains minor problems for which corrective actions appear would be highly effective.  Satisfactory: Indicates performance clearly meets the contractual requirements. The area of evaluation contains some minor problems for which the corrective actions appear satisfactory.  Marginal: Indicates performance meets contractual requirements. The area of evaluation contains a serious problem for which corrective actions have not yet been identified, appear only marginally effective, or have not been fully implemented.  Unsatisfactory: Indicates the contractor is in danger of not being able to satisfy contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The area of evaluation contains serious problems for which the corrective actions appear ineffective.

6. Surveillance Documents: Documentation used and referenced to perform surveillances may consist of Reports or PWS, the Quality Control Plan, Customer feedback, and the Surveillance Delivery Summary/Performance Surveillance Checklist. Documentation shall include the date, time, and location of the surveillance, applicable remarks to the surveillance, and signature of the COR. Unsatisfactory ratings must be signed by the contractor. 7. Rating: All contractor tasks will be rated as Exceptional, Satisfactory, Marginal, or Unsatisfactory. At the end of each year of a Task Order, the COR will provide the Surveillance Delivery Summary/Performance Surveillance Checklists and any supporting documentation to the KO. The KO will provide an overall rating. 8. Recording Observations: A Performance Assessment Report (PAR) and the Surveillance Delivery Summary/Performance Surveillance Checklist, if applicable to a task order, will be used to document observations and problems, and rate the individual contractor tasks. The PAR Form will be used to record each observed performance issue noted, for any tasks identified in each PWS. The Surveillance Checklists and PARs become formal record for reference. The contractor is told each time a performance issue is found during the observations. 9. Records: During the course of the contract, the COR retains a copy of all Surveillance Delivery Summary/ Performance Surveillance Checklists, and PARs with performance issues noted. The Surveillance Delivery Summary/Performance Surveillance Checklist and PARs become formal record for reference. At the end of the surveillance period, the COR will forward all inspection records to the KO for inclusion in the contract file. 10. Potential Unacceptable Performance: The COR must identify the specific service that is unacceptable and the possible causes, and ask a number of questions that will likely identify the source of the problem. The COR shall attempt to resolve the problem with the contractor.

10.1. When any specific service becomes unsatisfactory, the COR shall forward the original PAR, with the attempted solution (along with an evaluation of the results) documenting the observation, and the Surveillance Delivery Summary/Performance Surveillance Checklist, if used, to the KO. The surveillance reports will be used to provide an overall rating for the contract and each Task Order. 10.2. The contractor shall complete a response to the unacceptable evaluation if requested by the KO or by its own choice. 11 Taking Action: 11.1. The COR shall evaluate the contractor's performance and document any non-compliance, but only the KO may take action against the contractor for an unacceptable rating. 11.2. When the contractor's performance is unacceptable and a formal action is indicated, the COR and KO will determine what action is appropriate for the specific circumstances. The KO will determine the final action.

_____________________________________________________________________________ _______ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans.

Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.81 per hour computed on the basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract. VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

_____________________________________________________________________________ _______ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans.

Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.81 per hour computed on the basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract. VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 7 years, and 4 weeks after 11 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

_____________________________________________________________________________ _______ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: Life, accident, and health insurance plans, sick leave, pension plans, civic and personal leave, severance pay, and savings and thrift plans.

Minimum employer contributions costing an average of $3.81 per hour computed on the basis of all hours worked by service employees employed on the contract. VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

STOP-WORK ORDER (AUG 1989) - ALTERNATE I (APR 1984)

(a) The Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order to the Contractor, require the Contractor to stop all, or any part, of the work called for by this contract for a period of 90 days after the order is delivered to the Contractor, and for any further period to which the parties may agree. The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause. Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage. Within a period of 90 days after a stop-work is delivered to the Contractor, or within any extension of that period to which the parties shall have agreed, the Contracting Officer shall either-(1) Cancel the stop-work order; or (2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Termination clause of this contract. (b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled or the period of the order or any extension thereof expires, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule, the estimated cost, the fee, or a combination thereof, and in any other terms of the contract that may be affected, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-(1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and (2) The Contractor asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that, if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon the claim submitted at any time before final payment under this contract. (c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 14 of 101 Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.

F.O.B. DESTINATION (NOV 1991)

(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this clause, means-(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and (2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee. (b) The Contractor shall-(1)(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or (ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements; (2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading; (3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract; (4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract; (5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and (6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.

252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011) (a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor. (b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow. Solicitation:

(b) For items(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s). (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties.

Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "disputes." (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause. (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "DEFAULT."

CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209 -7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and (D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 56 of 101 (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 67 of 101 (1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ___ ) are, ( ___ ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ___ ) Are, ( ___ ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

NOTE: THE CONTRACT SUPPORT PERSONNEL IN PLACE UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT HAVE THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL.

L.3.3.7 RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR QUALIFIED WORKERS Contract support personnel who are in place under the current contract have the right of first refusal in accordance with FAR 52.222-17, Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers. The following is a list of labor categories and range of hourly rates established on the current Administrative Services IDIQ contract. Actual rates are proprietary to the incumbent contractor and are not revealed for this purpose. This information is provided for informational use only. The offeror is to propose a specified rate in Section J, Attachment 12 (Price Model).

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 91 of 101 L.4.0 VOLUME III ­ PAST PERFORMANCE (Factor 2) L.4.1 VOLUME ORGANIZATION The volume shall be organized according to the following outline: a. Table of Contents b. Team History and List of Team Effort c. Present and Past Performance Information, Form L-1 d. Past Performance Questionnaire, Form L-2 L.4.2 DESCRIPTION OF TEAM HISTORY AND LIST OF TEAM EFFORT (a) The Offeror shall provide a brief description of team history (within the past 5 years, if applicable), organization, a description of facilities and operating locations, products, services, customers. Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant present or past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this evaluation. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of the Offeror for the past 5 years and also include a "roadmap" for all team members identif ied in a Teaming Arrangement or Letter of Commitment for their efforts. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts the Offeror identifies for past performance evaluation and performance confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider present and past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the Offeror, these "roadmaps" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts the Offeror identifies and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources. If there is no team arrangement then this section does not need to be addressed. (b) Prime contractor shall provide a list of all subcontractors, description and percentage of effort to be performed. L.4.3 PRESENT AND PAST PERFORMANCE REFERENCES (Attachment Form L-1) The Offeror shall identify a minimum of three and a maximum of five references for the prime Offeror as well as a minimum of one and maximum of two references for each of the subcontractors and or teaming partners expected to perform aspects of the effort that the Offeror considers critical to the overall success of the program. The references shall represent recent contracts that the Offeror considers most relevant in demonstrating the Offeror's ability to perform the proposed effort. For each reference, the Offeror shall provide a narrative describing the effort and the results of the Offeror's performance. This narrative shall include rationale supporting the assecertation of relevance and should be supplemented with a completed Present and Past Performance Information Form (RFP, Attachment L1). For a description of the characteristics or aspects the Government will consider in determining relevance, see Evaluation and Basis of Award, paragraph 2.2.2, Factor 2: Past Performance. In addition to the information provided in the Present and Past Performance Volume, the Offeror shall ensure that each reference identified completes a Present and Past Performance Questionnaire (PPPQ) (RFP, Attachment L-2). This questionnaire shall be submitted directly to the government from the reference; questionnaires received from the Offeror will not be considered. The responsibility to send out and track the completion of the PPPQs rests solely with the Offeror. Completed Past Performance Questionnaires shall be sent in PDF format to the e-mail address shown in Paragraph 1.1.1 with the subject line "Past Performance Concerning HDTRA1 -14-R-0018 for Company XYZ". The Offeror's entity's name should replace the "Company XYZ" text shown in the previous sentence. L.4.4 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE CHANGE HISTORY Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant present or past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this competitive

To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of the Offeror for the past 5 years and also include a "roadmap" for all team members identified in a Teaming Arrangement or Letter of Commitment for their efforts. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts the Offeror identifies for past performance evaluation and performance confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider present and past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the Offeror, these "roadmaps" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts the Offeror identifies and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources. These "roadmaps" will not count toward the page limitations of Volume III. L.5.0 VOLUME IV ­ PRICE (Factor 3) L.5.1 GENERAL Offerors are to complete Schedule B of the solicitation. A template is included in Section J, Attachment 12 for the offeror to include details of the elements included in the burdened rates. Price analysis will be performed for the firm fixed priced contract line items (CLINS) by comparison of the proposed prices for the basic contract only. In order to determine price reasonableness, and in lieu of price data, Offerors are to provide their fully burdened rates for each labor category to include Secretarial, Clerical, Desktop Publisher/Editor, and Event Coordination and a total amount for travel. The price proposal should describe the pricing associated with your organization satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. The proposal should be prepared simply and economically, providing straightforward, concise delineation of capabilities to satisfactorily perform the contract being sought. These instructions are to assist the Offeror in submitting information other than cost and pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness and completeness of the proposed prices. Compliance with these instructions is mandatory and failure to comply may render the Offeror's proposal ineligible for award . Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness. The burden of proof of credibility of proposed prices rests with the offeror. Data beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted unless the offeror considers it essential to document or supports the price portion. All information relating to the proposed price, including the required supporting documentation must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Price Volume (Volume IV). Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal. In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a) and as detailed below, information other than cost or pricing data is not required. However, if after receipt of proposals it is determined that adequate price competition does not exist, certified cost or pricing data may be required (reference FAR 15.403-4). The Offeror shall provide current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data within the calendar days specified in the Contracting Officer's request. L.5.2 VOLUME ORGANIZATION The volume shall be organized according to the following outline: a. Table of Contents b. Glossary c. Price Narrative d. Pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology L.5.3 PRICE NARRATIVE L.5.3.1 Assumptions The price narrative shall identify all assumptions derived by the Offeror relating to estimated price and shall reference the applicable paragraph and page number in the other sections of the proposal that provides a corresponding discussion of the particular assumption.

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 93 of 101

L.5.3.2 Inconsistencies A price proposal is presumed to represent an Offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performances and price, shall be explained in the price narrative. For example, if the intended use of new and innovative techniques is the basis for an abnormally low estimate, the nature of these techniques and their impact on price should be explained. Any significant inconsistency, if unexplained, which raises a concern on the fundamental understanding of the nature and scope of the work required may be grounds for rejection of the proposal or grounds for adjusting the price. The burden of proof as to price-credibility rests with the Offeror. L.5.3.3 Cost and Pricing Information and Supporting Documentation The Offeror shall provide a detailed price proposal for accomplishing the PWS. The price proposal shall support the overall proposed firm fixed price for support services for each period of performance shall delineate labor hours and labor categories. The offeror shall provide a breakdown of their unburdened rates as detailed in Section J, Attachment 12 (Price Model). All dollar amounts shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. The price shall be broken out by period of performance for five years (Year 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). The offeror shall provide a breakdown of their unburdened rates as detailed in Section J, Attachment 12. It shall include at a minimum the rates required in accordance with the Department of Labor wage determination provided in Section J, Attachments 7 through 11 to include all elements. The proposal template-price model is provided in Section J, Attachment 12. The Government anticipates award of the contract for CLIN 0001 Administrative Support Services as Firm Fixed Priced and CLIN 0002 Travel as Cost Reimbursable. Offerors are to propose labor rates with effective start date (February 23, 2015 to February 22, 2016 and consecutive out years) for each year totaling five years for the number of hours at 1920 utilizing the hours at the following locations: National Capital Region, metropolitan Washington, DC; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Fort Walton Beach Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; West Point, New York; Travis AFB, California; and Kleber Kaserne, Germany. This section should also be reflective of overtime hourly rates. Hourly labor rates shall be proposed in accordance with the Department of Labor Wage and Determination Section J, Attachments 7 through 11. The estimated number of labor categories and labor rates for straight and overtime is established to determine if all offerors are evaluated the same. The Offeror's price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For award purposes it will be based upon the total price proposed for basic requirements ordering period of 5 years to include labor rates for each consecutive year. Price reasonableness will be determined by analyzing one hour of labor per category and travel. The Government will evaluate the completeness of each offeror's price proposal by assessing whether the offeror provided the required data to determine if it is realistic, provides sufficient detail to fully support the offer and is in compliance with the Department of Labor Wage Determination to permit the Government to evaluate the proposal thoroughly. As the burdened labor rates are proposed, the details of the unburdened labor rates will be analyzed to ensure compliance with DOL wage determination (including health and welfare (H&W)) and escalation factor of each year. A comparison of the labor rates will be made with other offerors to determine reasonableness. L.5.3.4 Travel Costs Travel is estimated and determined at the Task Order level. For the purpose of this solicitation, travel is estimated at not to exceed (NTE) $130,000 per year. Offerors are advised to include any indirect cost, (i.e. G&A), but the total travel cost may not exceed $130,000 per year. The proposal amount for travel shall not exceed the ceiling of $130,000 per year for a total of $650,000. (Example when applying G&A: Travel estimate at $120,000 plus G&A applied is $10,000 for a total NTE of $130,000.)

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 94 of 101 The offeror shall include plug numbers for travel pricing. The travel amounts are included in the table below by year of the contract. The travel amounts below cover all travel expenses (per diem, air fare, car rental, hotel, and applicable burdens, i.e. G&A). Applicable burdens are to be included in the amounts provided in the table. Offerors are reminded that Section G, clause 252.216-9005, establishes travel as a non-fee bearing cost element. No fee shall be applied to travel amounts.

FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference FEB 1998 This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The Offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the Offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the Offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://farsite.hill.af.mil FAR 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options JUL 1990

M.1.0 Evaluation Process and Review of Compliant Proposals The Government will evaluate fully, carefully, and impartially all proposals submitted in response to this Request for Proposal (RFP). However, the Contracting Officer may reject non-responsive proposals that deviate significantly from the instructions in the RFP, or that clearly do not address the government requirement from the Performance Work Statement. M.1.1 Award of Contract The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the contract without discussions. The Government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer. M.1.2 Eligibility of Offerors to Submit a Proposal This is a competitive procurement intended to be placed with a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concern. Proposals from ineligible contractors will be rejected. M.1.3 Discussions and Final Proposal Revisions The offeror is reminded that the Government intends to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Each offeror should submit its best proposal, as the opportunity to submit a revised proposal is not anticipated. If during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions; these discussions will be held with only those offerors determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the competitive range. Offeror responses to clarification requests, deficiencies identified, and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR), if any, will be considered in making the best value decision. M.1.4 Competitive Range If discussions are to be conducted, the contracting officer shall establish a competitive range. The contracting officer shall establish a competitive range comprised of all offerors capable of being rated technically acceptable, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency (reference FAR 15.306(c) (2)). If during the course of discussions, the contracting officer determines that an offer previously included in the competitive range should no longer be included in the competitive range, that proposal shall be eliminated from consideration of award. M.1.5 Final Evaluation of Proposals The initial evaluation of proposals within the competitive range may be revised in light of any additional information provided during subsequent discussion or furnished with the FPRs.

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 98 of 101 M.1.6 Basis for Award The Government will award to the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) offeror whose proposal is determined technically acceptable and lowest priced. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. M.1.7 Number of Contracts to be Awarded The Government anticipates awarding one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside (SDVOSB) competition. The Government reserves the right to award one or no contract. All offerors' proposals will be evaluated for a contract awarded under the SDVOSB competition. M.1.8 Rejection of Unrealistic Offers The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. M.1.9 Correction Potential of Proposals The Government will consider throughout the evaluation the "correction potential" of any deficiency or weakness. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range. M.1.10 Pre-Award Survey The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offeror's capability to meet the requirements of this solicitation. The Government may also perform a Financial Capability Analysis to verify that the offeror has the necessary financial resources to perform the effort through the life of the contract. M.2.0 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.2.1 General Considerations In addition to the evaluation of the specific factors identified below, the Government will consider compliance with solicitation terms and conditions. M.2.1.1 Specific Criteria ­ Evaluation Factors A Pass/Fail (Acceptable/Unacceptable) rating will be assigned to each subfactor under the Mission Capability and Past Performance factors. The Mission Capability subfactors are described below. The Past Performance factor is utilized to make a best value determination on those proposals that are technically acceptable. Thus, if an offeror fails to get an acceptable rating in one of the Mission Capability subfactors, then they are eliminated from Past Performance and Price evaluation. A Performance Confidence Assessment will be assigned to the Past Performance factor. Performance confidence represents the Government's assessment of the probability of an Offeror successfully performing as proposed and is derived from an evaluation of the offeror's present and past work record. Past Performance will be evaluated as described below in paragraph M.2.2.2. Price will be evaluated as described below in paragraph M.2.2.3. Factor 1: Mission Capability Sub-factor 1A: Management Approach Sub-factor 1B: Qualifications, Personnel, and Clearance Factor 2: Past Performance Factor 3: Price An Offeror must receive a Pass (acceptable rating) on all sub-factors within Factor 1, Mission Capability, in order to move forward to be evaluated on Factor 2, Past Performance. The evaluation team will not proceed with Factor 2 if the proposal does not receive an acceptable rating for Factor 1. An Offeror must receive a Pass (acceptable rating) on Factor 2, Past Performance, in order to move forward to be evaluated on Factor 3, Price. The evaluation team

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 99 of 101 will not proceed with Factor 3 if the proposal does not receive an acceptable rating for Factor 2. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are more important than price. Factors 1 and 2 are pass/fail and considered more important than Factor 3. M.2.2 Factor 1 ­ Mission Capability M.2.2.1 Acceptable (Pass)/Unacceptable (Fail) Rating Factor 1 (Subfactors 1A and 1B) Each Subfactor within the Mission Capability factor will receive an Acceptable (PASS) or Unacceptable (FAIL) rating. A failure rating will include a detailed explanation. Rating Acceptable Unacceptable Description Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

Subfactor 1A ­ Management Approach The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to perform the following as it relates to the basic contract:  Manage day-to-day operations,  Recruit, train and retain personnel,  Manage resources to adapt to emergent requirements,  Effectively incorporate quality control,  Efficiently utilize teaming partners/subcontractors to fulfill requirements, if applicable,  Effectively transition ensuring an orderly transition of functions and tasks from the outgoing contractor to their company,  Provide a transition plan to be used at the end of the contract period to ensure an orderly transition to an incoming contractor awarded the follow-on effort,  Fully describe their capabilities to successfully perform administrative support,  Provide a detailed plan for the establishment of a Quality Control Plan that demonstrates procedures to ensure services are performed in accordance with the Performance Work Statement, and  Responsiveness to the Section 508 specifications (i.e. a completed GPAT or VPAT or equivalent). The elements identified in Paragraph L.3.3.1, responsiveness to Section 508 requirements will be considered in arriving at a pass fail rating. Subfactor 1B ­ Qualifications, Personnel, and Clearances (a) Clearance Documentation: The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to hold a TOP SECRET facility clearance at time of proposal submission and have the required number of personnel who are U.S. citizens and who have the appropriate up-to-date security clearances. Security clearance must have been obtained or updated within the past 10 years for a TOP SECRET clearance. Personnel utilized in the performance of the contract must be U.S. citizens. Names and proof of employment, or letters of intent, are required with the initial proposal, except those marked not applicable (N/A) in section L.3.3.4. (b) Job Descriptions: Offeror submitted job descriptions will be evaluated for the offeror's ability to perform the minimum qualifications and standard job descriptions outlined in section L.3.3.6 and in the basic contract requirements. This will be accomplished through by submitting job descriptions of all labor categories. (c) Resumes: Offeror submitted resumes will be evaluated for their ability to accomplish the requirements of the basic PWS and meet minimum qualifications and standard job description provided in section L.3.3.6.

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 100 of 101 M.2.2.2. Factor 2 ­ Past Performance There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate whether the offer or's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort. The second aspect of past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. Relevancy will be determined as follows: Rating Description Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Past performance will be rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis to determine how well the contractor performed on relevant contracts. In terms of the analysis of past performance, the following will be utilized: Rating Acceptable Description Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Unacceptable

The past performance evaluation process will also consist of gathering information from customers, interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, Fee-Determining Officials, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and other government databases, as well as other sources to determine how well the offeror performed those past contracts. Offerors that do not possess a record of relevant performance or for whom information on present and past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably for Past Performance. Such Offerors will receive a "Neutral" rating to signify an "Unknown" confidence rating for the Past Performance factor. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "Unknown" shall be considered "Acceptable". Each Offeror will receive one of the ratings described below: Rating Acceptable Definition Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Unacceptable

M.2.2.3 Factor 3 ­ Price The Government will not rate or score price but will evaluate each Offeror's price proposal for reasonableness and completeness. The proposal will serve as the basis for the price evaluation. The Offeror's price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For award purposes it will be based upon the total price proposed for the 5 years to include labor rates for each consecutive year. Price reasonableness will be determined by analyzing one hour of labor per category and travel. The Government will evaluate the completeness of each offeror's price proposal by assessing whether the offeror provided the required data to determine if it is realistic, provides sufficient detail to fully support the offer and is in compliance with the Department of Labor Wage Determination (DOL/WD) to permit the Government to evaluate the proposal thoroughly. As the burdened labor rates are proposed, the details of the unburdened labor rates will be

HDTRA1-14-R-0018 Page 101 of 101 analyzed to ensure compliance with DOL/WD and escalation factor of each year. A comparison of the labor rates will be made with other offerors to determined reasonableness.
