(2) Access To and Use of Government Information: If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to Government information such as plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, or data which has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, it shall not: (a) use such information for any private purpose unless the information has been released or otherwise made available to the public; (b) compete for work based on such information .until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; (c) submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government which is based on such information until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; and (d) release such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise made available to the public by the Government. (3) Access To and Protection of Proprietary Information: The Contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access to proprietary data, trade secrets, or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or financial information (hereinafter referred to as "proprietary data") under this contract, it shall not use or

disclose such information for any purpose other than providing the contract support services, and will not use or disclose the information for any personal or other commercial purpose. The Contractor
further agrees to enter into a written agreement for the protection of the proprietary data of others and to exercise diligent effort to protect such proprietary data from unauthorized use or disclosure. A copy of each such written agreement shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer. In addition, the Contractor shall obtain from each employee who has access to proprietary data under this contract, a written agreement which shall in substance provide that such employee shall not, during his/her employment by the Contractor or thereafter, disclose to others or use for their benefit, proprietary data received in connection with the work under this Contract. c. Subcontracts: The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in consulting agreements and subcontracts of any tier when directed by the Contracting Officer. The terms "contract," "Contractor," and "Contracting Officer" will be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. d.

Remedies and Waiver: (1) For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be disclosed during this contract, the Government may terminate this contract for default, disqualify the Contractor for subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. If, however, in compliance with this clause, the Contractor discovers and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest (or potential therefore) subsequent to contract award, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if such termination is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government. (2) The parties recognize that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which this clause might be applied in the future and that the clause has effect which will survive the performance of this contract. Accordingly, the Contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Contracting Officer by submitting a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the Head of Contracting Activity will grant such a waiver in writing. f. Modifications: Prior to a contract modification, when the Statement of Work is changed to add new work or the period of performance is significantly increased, the Contracting Officer will request, and the Contractor is required to submit, either an organizational conflict of interest disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.

CONTRACTOR NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
CONTRACT NO. _____________________ DELIVERY/TASK ORDER NO. _______ _______________________________(hereinafter (employee) and _______________ (hereinafter "agent") are employees of ___________________________________ (hereinafter "contractor"). The contractor is providing support services to the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and is likely to have access to nonpublic information. We, both in a personal, private, professional and employment capacity to the contractor, understand that:

When used in this agreement the term "nonpublic information" is information generally not available to the public, includes Government generated information or information obtained by the Government in the course of Government employee's official duties or position, which would normally not be releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. Nonpublic information also includes proprietary information and personal privacy information. Government generated information includes, but is not limited to, source selection plans, technical evaluation plans, evaluations of technical proposals, evaluations of cost proposals, competitive range determinations, rankings of bids, or proposals , internal and external government generated memorandum, correspondence, documents, data and all information that would not normally be released under 5 U.S.C. 552 (reference (e)). Proprietary information, also known as a trade secret, is information that a company wishes to keep confidential or protected from those outside the company. The Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) defines trade secrets as "information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known, and that is kept secret through reasonable actions." Proprietary information can include, but is not limited to secret formulas, processes, and methods used in production. It can also include a company's business and marketing plans, salary structure, customer lists, contracts, and computer systems. In some cases, the special knowledge and skills that an employee has learned on the job are considered to be a company's proprietary information. Personal Privacy Information is any information, record item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his personal address, social security number, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph; THEREFORE, we, both in our personal, private, professional and employment capacity to the contractor
agree and promise: Not to seek access to nonpublic information beyond what is required for the performance of the support services contract; To ensure that my status as a contractor employee is known when seeking access to and receiving such nonpublic information from Government employees; Not to use or disclose such non-public information for any purpose other than providing the contract support services; this includes not disclosing such non-public information to anyone within the company unless required for the contract support services; Not to use or disclose the information for any personal, professional or any other purpose;

Not to email or remove, in any manner, any information used during the course of the contract, without prior written permission from the Contracting Officer; and To promptly notify the Contracting Officer and the DCMA Office of Counsel of any attempt by an individual (including any contractor personnel, company or Government Representative) to gain unauthorized access to nonpublic information, and of any disclosure of such information to unauthorized parties. Such notification shall include the name and organization, if available, of the individual, company or Government Representative seeking access to such information. To return any nonpublic information given to me pursuant to this agreement, including any transcriptions of nonpublic information to which I was given access, (if not already destroyed). The contractor and I understand that any unauthorized use, release or disclosure of nonpublic information in violation of this agreement will subject me and the contractor to administrative, civil or criminal remedies as may be authorized by law. The contractor and I acknowledge that the owner of any proprietary information improperly disclosed stands as an intended third-party beneficiary of this non-disclosure agreement. In the event of an unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information, the owner of the information may seek legal recovery under this nondisclosure agreement, even though the information owner is not a formal party to the agreement. The contractor and I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the United States Government from any claim or action for any damages caused by his/her improper handling or disclosure of such information received. The contractor and I understand that an improper release of such information may subject the contractor, it, him/her and his/her company or institution, to administrative and civil remedies by the Government, including those discussed below. The undersigned understands that improper handling or disclosure of such information received from the Government may be considered by the Government as relating to suspension and debarment as Part 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and that any improper handling of such information received may also be considered as an issue of contractor responsibility under FAR 9.1, and further may be considered in evaluating past performance under the FAR.. Further, any willful mishandling may subject him/her, his/her company or institution to administrative or criminal penalties under several statutes including, but not limited to, the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831, and the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. The aforementioned nonpublic information is Government property and the theft, or conversion without authority, of such property is potentially punishable under 18 U.S.C. 641. A breach of this agreement will be considered a breach of the contract and may be reason for termination for default or termination for cause.

PART III ­ Past Performance Factor 3 ­ Past Performance Past performance is an indicator of a contractor's ability to perform satisfactorily on future awards and is a record of contractor's conformance to specifications, quality conformance, adherence to contract schedules, and commitment to customer satisfaction.

The Government will utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov to evaluate contractor past performance for those contractors having previously performed on a Federal Government contract (s). PPIRS is a web-enabled, government-wide application that collects quantifiable and narrative contractor past performance information from all Federal contracting agencies and provides a contractor's previous performance based on Federal Stock Class (FSC) or Product Service Code (PSC). In the event no information is available in PPIRS, the offeror may be requested to submit information on past and current Federal, State and local government as well as private sector contracts performed by the offeror within the last three years that are similar in nature to this acquisition; or may assign a neutral rating for the offeror. By submitting past performance information, the offeror agrees to permit the Government's representative to contact the listed reference and inquire of the offeror's performance. PART IV ­ Price Quote Factor 5 ­ Price This solicitation requests price reductions from the GSA FSS contract pricing.

EVALUATION AND AWARD CRITERIA Quotes submitted in response to this RFQ will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below. It is imperative that offerors respond directly to each area specified and to ensure that their quote is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Responses which merely repeat the Technical Requirements cannot be considered as being responsive to the requirements of the RFQ. Assurances of experience, capability or qualifications, without a clear demonstration to support the claim, may adversely influence the evaluation of the quote. The Government intends to evaluate and make award without discussions. Quotations should contain the vendor's best terms regarding non-price and price factors. Additionally, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revisions to quotations if it is determined to be necessary. If a negotiation range is established, the Government may limit the number of offers in the negotiation range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition. Award will be made to the offeor whose quotation complies with the RFQ, meets the Government's minimum requirements and has an acceptable Past Performance rating. The non-price factors are of equal importance to each other and when combined are less important than price. Once the non-price submissions have been evaluated the evaluated quotations that have been determined technically acceptable and have an acceptable Past Performance rating will then be compared to the price quotes and an award will be made to the lowest priced offer. PART I ­ Administrative Data Quotes that fail to furnish the required information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. PART II ­ Technical Factor 1 ­ Technical Approach The Government will evaluate each offer to ensure that the Offeror addressed and meets the minimum requirements.

Factor 2 ­ Licensing Agreements Software Licensing Agreements will be reviewed to determine: 1) consistency with Federal Law; 2) meets the Government's needs. The license(s) will be determined acceptable or not acceptable. PART III ­ Past Performance Factor 3 ­ Past Performance Offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine how well the offeror demonstrated compliance with prior contract requirements for work similar in nature to the work described in the Technical Specification. The Government will utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov to evaluate contractor past performance for those contractors having previously performed on a Federal Government contract(s). The Government may also consider past performance information obtained through source(s) provided from the offeror or other sources. Past performance will be evaluated as either acceptable or unacceptable. A neutral rating may be applied for any contractor not having data available within PPIRS. Any offer that receives a neutral rating will be treated as acceptable. PART IV ­ Price Quote Factor 4 ­ Price The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. An offer may be rejected or not be considered for award if it is materially unbalanced. An offer is considered to be materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less for some deliverables and prices which are significantly higher for other similar deliverables; and/or when discrepancies are present between prices for the basic requirement and prices for the option requirement. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s). Offerors price proposal must include the spreadsheet at Attachment 2 containing the offerors proposed price. Evaluation of price will be accomplished separately from the technical evaluation. Any significant inconsistency, if unexplained, raises a fundamental issue of the offerors understanding of the nature and scope of the work required. It also may reflect on the offerors ability to perform the contract within financial restraints and may be cause for not selecting the proposal for award.
