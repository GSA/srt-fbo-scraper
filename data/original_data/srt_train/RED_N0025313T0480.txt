The Department of Defense (DOD) has authorized use of PPIRS-SR for use by DOD activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.

This information is collected form existing DOD reporting systems during the source selection process. (c) Quality: PPIRS-SR collects quantifiable quality data from existing systems and uses that data to classify supplier performance by Federal Supply code or federal Services Code (FSA group). Based on comparisons among suppliers in a specific FSC group, PPIRS-SR sorts suppliers into color ratings representing the supplier's overall quality performance based on the following indices:

N00253-13-T-0480 Page 41 of 41 Color Dark Blue Purple Green Yellow Red Position Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group

(Note: if all supplier ratings for a specific FSC group are equal, all suppliers with that group will be classified green. Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be displayed without a rating and, for evaluation, receive a neutral rating.) (d) Delivery: supplier deliver past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on-time deliveries. On-time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor reflecting the length of time a delivery was overdue. (e) PPIRS-SR classifications are determined monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.
