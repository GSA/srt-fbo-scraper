1. DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AFFECTING AWARD AND PERFORMANCE 1.1 It is the Department of Transportation's (DOT) policy to award contracts to only those offerors whose objectivity is not impaired because of any related past, present, or planned interest, financial or otherwise, in organizations regulated by DOT or in organizations whose interests may be substantially affected by Departmental activities, based on this policy: 1.2 The offerors shall provide a statement in its proposal which describes in a concise manner all past, present or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) which do or may result in any real or potential bias on its part in performing its obligations under any contract which may result from this solicitation. The interest(s) described shall include those of the offeror, its affiliates, proposed consultants, proposed subcontractors and key personnel of technical proposal. Key personnel shall include any person owning more than 20% interest in the offeror, and the offeror's corporate officers, its senior managers and any employee who is responsible for making a decision or taking an action on such contract where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of an affected organization or individual. 1.3 The offeror shall describe in detail why it believes, in light of the interest(s) identified in paragraph (1.1) of this section, that performance of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an impartial and objective manner. 1.4 In the absence of any relevant interest identified in paragraph (1.1) of this section, the offeror shall submit in its proposal a statement certifying that to its best knowledge and belief no affiliation exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The offeror must obtain the same information from potential subcontractors prior to award of a subcontract. 1.5 The Contracting Officer shall review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the offeror. All such information, and any other relevant information known by the Contracting Officer, will be used to determine whether an award to the offeror may create a conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract award. 1.6 The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information required may result in disqualification of the offeror for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If, after award, the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to the contract awarded as a result of this solicitation, which such conflict could not reasonably have been known prior to award, an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. The disclosure shall include a full description of the conflict, a description of the action the contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflict. The Contracting Officer may, however, terminate the contract for convenience if he or she deems that termination is in the best interest of the Government.

"First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Contractor to furnish supplies or services (including construction) for performance of a prime contract, but excludes supplier agreements with vendors, such as long-term arrangements for materials or supplies that would normally be applied to a Contractor's general and administrative expenses or indirect cost. "Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the Contractor's preceding fiscal year and includes the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)): (1) Salary and bonus. (2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights.

52.212-2

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

A BASIS FOR AWARD The award will be made based on the best overall (i.e.,best value) proposals that are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to four (4) evaluation factors on a trade-off basis: (1) Technical Approach, (2) Experience; (3) Past Performance, and (4) Price. All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB). Proposals will be evaluated according to the evaluation criteria stated below. In conducting its evaluation, the Government intends to determine which offer proposes the best value. Accordingly, the Government may award any resulting contract to other than the offer proposing the lowest price or other than the offer achieving the highest rating. In accordance with FAR 52.2151(f)(4), it is the Government's intent to award without discussion; therefore it is incumbent upon all offers to submit their best proposal. Award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price(s) offered. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for the Technical Approach Factor. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical or management features. No proposal shall be considered for award that fails to reflect the offer's clear intent to provide the full amount of work described in this solicitation. Accordingly, no proposal shall be considered for award that merely regurgitates the any or all areas of the RFP. Relative Importance of Factors. The Technical Approach Factor is slightly more important than the Capabilities and Experience Factor. All sub-Factors are equally rated. The Capabilities and Experience Factor is slightly more important than the Past Performance. All sub-Factors are equally rated. Non-Price Factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Price. Price is not an adjectivally rated Factor; however, the Price Factor will become the more dominant factor as technical proposals reach technical equality. In such cases, where all nonpriced factors being evaluated are virtually the same, best value may be represented by the lowest-priced proposal.

B EVALUATION CRITERIA
(1) EVALUATION FACTORS AND APPROACH All proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel.

19

DTFT60-10-R-00003 Bus, Safety and Security Technical Support Services Program (2) FACTORS AND SUB-FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED Each offer will submit a five-volume written proposal. Volume 1 is Technical Approach, Volume 2 is Experience, Volume 3 is Past Performance, Volume 4 is Price, and Volume Five is Certifications and Representations. Evaluation factors include the following: Factor 1 - Technical Approach. Sub-Factor 1.1 ­ Understanding of Requirement Sub-Factor 1.2 ­ Program Management Factor 2 ­ Experience Sub-Factor 2.1 ­ Technical Experience Sub-Factor 2.2 ­ Key Personnel Factor 3 ­ Past Performance Factor 4 ­ Price

(a) FACTOR 1 ­ TECHNICAL APPROACH i) Sub-factor 1.1 ­ Understanding of Requirement. (a) Degree to which the offeror's proposal demonstrates a complete understanding of the Bus Safety and Security Program requirements and provides a comprehensive approach to meeting the requirements of the Request for Proposal (RFP). (b) The degree to which the offerors proposal demonstrates a complete understanding of bus safety and security onsite reviews and processes; state DOT seminars and website development; and the degree of experience in working with clients and their stakeholders support an oversight program. (c) The degree to which the approach to achieving the tasks includes innovative and creative ways to achieve the objectives of the program. ii) Sub-factor 1.2 ­ Program Management. (a) Degree to which the offer proposes to organize, plan, report, prioritize, schedule work, and exercise program control (b) Degree to which the prime and team member's roles and functions within the team are sufficiently and suitably defined, allocated and managed within the team to satisfy the full range of effort contained in the SOW (c) The strategies and methods to be used to management assignment from FTA (d) The systems and approaches used to administer the project (e) The contractor's approach to managing subcontractors, if any

(b) FACTOR 2 ­ EXPERIENCE i) Sub-Factor 2.1, Corporate Experience (a) The offerors will be evaluated under this factor on the extent and quality of their own Corporate experience. 20

DTFT60-10-R-00003 Bus, Safety and Security Technical Support Services Program (b) Extent to which the offeror's cited experience has been performed within the past 3 years and the relevancy of experience that is similar in scope and complexity to this project. ii) Sub-Factor 2.2, Key Personnel ­ (a) The degree to which the qualifications of the proposed key personnel are relevant to and demonstrate the potential for successfully performing the work required in the SOW (b) The degree to which the proposed key personnel have specific experience as stated in the SOW and relative to the SOW task areas and are available and committed to the program.

(c) FACTOR 3 - PAST PERFORMANCE (a) The evaluators rate past performance by assessing the offeror's recent performance on projects similar in scope to this solicitation. The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. Proposals will be evaluated based on the contractor's relevant past performance record on similar federal, state, local and commercial contracts. When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on past performance of the offeror under existing and prior contracts over the past three (3) years as it relates to all solicitation requirements. Relevancy is defined as the scope, magnitude, complexity, and similarity of offeror's past performance as it relates to this acquisition. Quality of performance is defined as the level of past performance provided which will be used as an indicator of the offeror's likelihood of success. (b) Adverse Past Performance may result in an overall high-risk rating. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will be evaluated on past performance information regarding predecessor companies and key personnel who have experience relevant to the acquisition. If an offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance or if past performance information is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. An "unknown risk" factor will be given. Offerors that would be eliminated from the competitive range solely based on negative findings in past performance shall be given an opportunity to address such findings. (c) The offeror's past performance will be evaluated to determine, (1) Compliance of Products, Services, Documents, and Related Deliverables to Specification Requirements and Standards of Good Workmanship; (2) Maintain Program Execution within reasonable Costs; (3) Timeliness of Performance for Services and Product Deliverables, including the Administrative Aspects of Performance; (4) Ability to Resolve Technical and Manufacturing Problems Quickly and Effectively; and (5) Commitment to Customer Satisfaction and Business-like Concern for its Customers. (d) Customer assessments of the offerors are also evaluated by using the past performance questionnaire submitted to other customers of the offeror and by considering information in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), available at http://www.ppirs.gov/ (if available). (e) The evaluation process will consider the elements identified in the Questionnaires at Attachment #4.

(d) FACTOR 4 - PRICE The Offeror will be evaluated based on completeness, reasonableness and balance. The determination that the total price is fair and reasonable will be based on information submitted with the offeror's proposal (See Instruction to Offerors), the comparison of other competitive offers, and the Independent Government Estimate (IGCE).

21

DTFT60-10-R-00003 Bus, Safety and Security Technical Support Services Program a. Reasonableness. An assessment of the Offeror's estimating methodology to determine whether the proposed prices are reasonable based upon a comparison with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) and prices proposed by other Offerors. b. Completeness. This includes responsiveness in addressing all RFP requirements. The proposal will be reviewed to ensure information provided is sufficient to allow a complete analysis and evaluation of the rates delineated in the CLINs and includes all information required in Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors. c. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total for all options to the total for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the options are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The following definitions apply to the evaluation: ˇ Unbalanced Pricing - Unrealistically low or high proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. Proposals shall be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their credibility. The burden of proof for credibility rests with the offeror. Errors in Pricing - Any variance between total prices and unit prices will be corrected on the basis of the unit price provided in Section B. FTA reserves the right to adjust any and all totals on that basis. The overall price evaluation will be based on corrected total prices. If adjustments are made, the affected offerors will be notified.

ˇ

C) Rating Procedures: The following adjectival rating scale will be used to assess the offers Non-Priced Factors, Factor 1, Technical Approach, and Factor 2 Capabilities and Experience ADJECTIVE Excellent DEFINITION AND CRITERIA The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly results in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes numerous advantageous characteristics of substance, and essentially no disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to exceed all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and some disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate as the proposal contains solutions which are considered somewhat feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are relatively clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. 22

Very Good

Good

DTFT60-10-R-00003 Bus, Safety and Security Technical Support Services Program Acceptable Risk Level: Moderate The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate to high, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect moderate risk in that they are somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Moderate The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has numerous disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are far outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages will not result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions are further considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision, are unsupported, and do not demonstrate an understanding of the requirement. Risk Level: Very High

Unacceptable

Adjectival Ratings and Definitions for Factor 3, Past Performance 3. Factor 3 - Past Performance Risk Rating Definitions. A rating of Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk or Unknown Risk (as defined below) will be assigned to these Factors.

Risk Low Moderate High Unknown Risk

Description Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's experience/performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort. Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's experience/performance record, that the offeror will successfully perform the proposed effort. Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's experience/performance record, that the offeror can perform the proposed effort. Little or no relevant experience/performance record identifiable; equates to a neutral rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.

4. Deficiency. A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. 5. Strength. Any aspect of a proposal when judged against a stated evaluation criterion enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract. A significant strength appreciably enhances the merit of a proposal or appreciably increases the probability of successful contract performance. 6. Significant Strength. A significant strength appreciably enhances the merit of a proposal or appreciably increases the probability of successful contract performance. 7. Weakness. A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A significant weakness in a proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. 8. Significant Weakness. A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.

DTFT60-10-R-00003 Bus, Safety and Security Technical Support Services Program ATTACHMENT # 1 Statement of Work (SOW) For Bus Safety and Security Program Support PART 1 GENERAL INFORMATION 1.1 Description of Services/Introduction: The Office of Safety and Security within the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is charged with delivering programs that ensure the highest possible level of safety and security for the nation's public transportation systems. FTA has responded to this charge through the development of safety and security programs to meet the needs of passengers and employees in different modal environments. For the bus industry, FTA achieves these objectives through the Transit Bus Safety and Security Program. 1.2 Background: The Office of Safety and Security within FTA is charged with delivering programs that ensure the highest possible level of safety and security for the nation's public transportation systems. FTA has responded to this charge through the development of safety and security programs to meet the needs of passengers and employees in different modal environments. For the bus industry, FTA achieves these objectives through the Transit Bus Safety and Security Program. The Transit Bus Safety and Security Program is a voluntary oversight program that resulted from findings and recommendations in a report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB): Transit Bus Safety Oversight (NTSB/SIR-98/03). In 2002, FTA established a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with American Public Transportation Association (APTA), the Community Transit Association of America (CTAA), and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to address NTSB recommendations. In collaboration with APTA, CTAA, and AASHTO, the Transit Bus Safety and Security Program promotes comprehensive and effective strategies and methods to improve transit bus safety, security, and emergency preparedness for public transit bus agencies of all sizes, including urban, small urban, rural, and community transit. Its objectives are to improve safety and security for passengers, employees, and all others who share roadways with public transit buses. Over the past two years, FTA has implemented a deliberate and focused approach to the development and implementation of the Bus Safety and Security Program. The program has successfully: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Established working relationships with FTA's program partners, state departments of transportation (DOT), industry providers, associations, educational institutions and other Federal partners Focused initial program efforts on 5311 and small 5307 providers to raise the transit industry's baseline for efforts in safety, security, and emergency preparedness at small, rural and community transit systems Established a framework to assist transit agencies in their pursuit of safety, security, and emergency preparedness excellence Established a working group to provide overall program guidance and program sub-groups to provide input on specific program areas of focus Conducted voluntary onsite reviews of individual transit agencies Developed an extensive resource website Conducted state DOT orientation seminars Provided ongoing technical assistance to 5311 and small 5307 providers including dissemination of technical assistance materials and answering questions posed by industry representatives

Each of the above program efforts has supported FTA's goal of continuous improvement in the nation's safety, security, and emergency preparedness posture. Throughout implementation of these activities, FTA has coordinated with the industry and its partners.

However, the initial focus of the FTA program has been to address the needs of smaller transit agencies and thus materials have been reviewed and chosen for the website based partially on that priority. As the program moves forward in addressing the needs of larger bus systems, it will be important to expand the resource identification process to include documents that have specific applicability to larger systems including resources that are applicable to rail operations and maintenance and safety requirements. ˇ ˇ ˇ The contractor will identify and collect technical assistance materials for larger transit systems. The contractor will identify technical assistance materials to be uploaded to the website resource library. Resource must be in a web-accessible format. The contractor will coordinate with FTA's SSO Program to ensure that resources supporting rail systems are incorporated into the website. 36

DTFT60-10-R-00003 Bus, Safety and Security Technical Support Services Program ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The contractor will help set up a small committee with APTA to facilitate quarterly meetings regarding assistance to larger bus systems The contractor will facilitate quarterly meetings with APTA to identify resources for review. Periodically, the consultant will review online technical assistance materials to assess whether or not they require updating or removal from the content management system. If gaps in resources are identified, the contractor will develop technical assistance materials to fill gaps identified through program or feedback from industry. As necessary, the contractor will develop templates, checklists or forms to fill gaps in existing technical assistance tools. ˇ The contractor will provide video scripts and content to support the Program's Learning Series.

5.1.4.2 Website functionality and design The new and re-engineered FTA Bus Program is founded on the philosophy that "one size does not fit all" in the implementation of safety, security, and emergency preparedness efforts. Consistent with the "one size does not fit all" philosophy, the existing self-assessment tool was designed specifically for use by rural and small urban transit agencies. It has been validated through the onsite review process as an effective instrument in identifying smaller transit system strengths and areas in need of improvement. This tool will have only limited applicability for use with mid-size and large transit bus agencies. Therefore a new and expanded self-assessment tool that reflects the operating characteristics and environments of mid to large transit agencies must be developed to support the evaluation of safety, security, and emergency preparedness performance.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

The contractor will meet with FTA to collect information regarding the expansion of the site's design, hosting and functionality specifications to meet the needs of larger systems that operate both bus and rail. The contractor will provide wireframes of the site's new design and functionality to FTA for review and approval. The contractor will use employee's extensive industry experience to expand the resource library and to address issues facing larger systems which operate both bus and rail. The contractor will develop new methods within the site to help agencies identify problems and quickly find the bus or rail content they are looking for. The contractor will use employee's experience to develop new methods within the site for agencies to evaluate their progress in the program. The contractor will utilize NTD data and aggregate user date from the site to create tools and features that encourage collaboration and community for bus and rail operators facing similar challenges. The contractor will adhere to 508 and modern web standards compliance. The contractor will use video footage, maps, graphs, charts, and interactive tools to help bus and rail providers identify problems facing their agency. The contractor will identify questions from the existing self-assessment tool that apply medium to large size bus systems. The contractor will use its experience in onsite reviews to identify questions that must be added to the checklist to address aspects of large transit systems. The contractor will use its experience to ensure the site meets FTA's requirements for off-site hosting and security. The contractor will use its experience with php programming to integrate new questions into the code of the existing self-assessment framework.

The contractor will send website-generated emails to a select group to test the new self-assessment tool.

5.1.5 Task 5 - Provide Web-based Case Studies FTA wishes to expand its capability to deliver short, informative learning videos to the transit bus community through its program website. FTA is looking to develop a case-based approach that provides the industry an opportunity to read cases, view streamed video, and follow links to the Resource Library of current effective practices. FTA expects the web-based cases to bridge effective practices and the complex transit bus industry. The outcome will be that industry representatives are able to practice recognizing and solving issues as they relate to safety, security and emergency preparedness. ˇ ˇ The contractor will identify a methodology for industry representative to apply during their review of the case and that they can leverage during their everyday operations. The contractor will develop two case studies.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

The contractor will develop a mechanism for the website so that industry representatives can share their stories. The contractor will review submitted stories and identify those that will be used as we-based case studies and draft the video script for each case. The contractor will tape each approved case study and submit the video to FTA. Upon approval, the contractor will upload the video to the Bus Website, along with a transcript, images, and links to relevant effective practices. The contractor will track usage of each case study and report analytics back to FTA on a quarterly basis.

5.1.6 Task 6 - Working Group and MOU Partner Coordination FTA currently coordinates with its Working Group members, subgroup members and representatives from AASHTO, APTA and CTAA. ˇ ˇ The contractor will support FTA in the conduct of quarterly meetings or teleconference calls with its MOU Partners (AASHTO, APTA, and CTAA). The contractor will maintain ongoing correspondence and communication with Working Group and subgroup members and document communication for FTA. 5.1.7 Task 7 ­ Outreach and Collaboration The Transit Bus Safety and Security Program initiated coordination efforts with state DOTs and their sub-recipients through a State DOT Invitational Workshop and the state DOT Orientation Seminars. FTA would like to build on existing partnerships with APTA, AASHTO, CTAA, National RTAP, TSA and Tribal Community Representatives and enhance program awareness through coordination at workshops, conferences and other venues. Further, FTA will reach out more frequently to stakeholders through meetings and teleconference calls to discuss program policy and direction. In addition, FTA will coordinate its own workshops to support the advancement of the program at venues whose focus is not primarily on safety, security and emergency preparedness. ˇ The contractor will update program presentations for distribution to the community and presentation on the Bus Website.
