Attachment A

Statement of Objectives (SOO)

BACKGROUND

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was created in 1958 when the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level defense organization to formulate and execute R&D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories.  DARPA was created in order to prevent the occurrence of strategic surprise in relation to breakthrough technologies.  To support this need, we are seeking a news monitoring service to provide daily news updates across approximately 10-15 topic areas; these topic areas will be provided by the Research Support Center and may be periodically changed as the needs of DARPA shift.  

SCOPE

This contract will provide services from one single, reliable source for news monitoring on a variety of topics, including breakthroughs and ongoing news of interest within the specified topic areas.

OBJECTIVES

The objective of acquiring news monitoring and reporting services is to equip DARPA personnel with the necessary tools needed to keep the Agency well-informed of breaking and ongoing news/activities as they relate to continuing or future Agency research programs.  It will allow DARPA personnel to be proactive and efficient in monitoring relevant news, technology research and developments, completing timely research, providing contacts for potential contractors or future Program Managers (PM), and assisting Agency experts and executives with relevant information.

TASKS



The contractor shall provide curated coverage of international news on a variety of topics.  These topic areas may change as DARPA’s focus, strategic direction and research needs shift.

The DARPA Research Support Center will provide 10-15 topic areas to monitor.  The contractor should provide no fewer than 35 stories per report; this will include approximately 3-5 stories per topic area on a daily basis.

The contractor shall provide the report no later than 8AM EST each business day, Monday-Friday.

The contractor shall provide a headline, brief summary, source, and a link to the full article.

In addition to open source content, the contractor shall make the full-text of premium content (i.e. content that is behind a paywall) available to the DARPA customer.  If the contractor is unable to provide a link directly to the full-text of premium content, the full-text shall be otherwise made available (for example, as a PDF scanned from a newspaper).

The contractor shall accommodate modifications based on feedback from the Research Support Center.  Examples of modifications may include notifications of a broken link, inclusion of a new article, or revisions to the list of topic areas to search.

At a minimum, the contractor shall include English language international news from news outlets, magazines, web publications, and social media.

The contractor shall be accessible via email and may be provided via the world-wide web.

The contractor shall make the report accessible and viewable across all personal/portable electronic devices (computer, smartphone, and tablet).

The contractor shall not contain duplicate news articles (e.g. an Associated Press article picked up by multiple news outlets).

The contractor shall make an archive of all past news updates accessible to the DARPA customers.

The contractor shall include weekly and/or monthly usage statistics (click-through).

The contractor may include a daily afternoon update.

The contractor may include weekend and holiday issues.

The contractor shall put in place security procedures to prevent those outside DARPA from viewing the report. A discussion of these security procedures shall be submitted with the contractor’s proposal.



SAMPLE REPORT



The Offeror shall provide a sample report in accordance with the specifications listed in the SOO. Reports shall include articles on a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) topics relevant to DARPA.  The goal of this sample report is for the Government to evaluate how the proposed tool will fulfill the requirements of the SOO. 



The Government will evaluate this sample report based on usability (i.e. no broken links, etc.), relevance (i.e. articles are on topic), uniqueness (i.e. no duplication of stories), quality (i.e. authority/currency of articles, etc.), and accessibility of the report.

Brief description of contract work, scope, and responsibilities

The Government will evaluate the Vendor’s past performance information as a measure of the Government’s confidence in the contractor’s ability to successfully provide similar services in compliance with contract requirements.  If no relevant past performance information is submitted, past performance will be rated as neutral.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

DARPA requests a firm-fixed price (FFP) quote for the services described in the SOO for the initial cost, annual recurring cost, licensing structure for the base award and all four options. All relevant costs shall be included in the contractor’s response to the RFQ. Quotes shall be valid for a minimum of 90 days from submission of quote.

EVALUATION FACTORS

Factor 1: The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror demonstrates the technical ability to provide a news monitoring service in accordance with the Statement of Objectives.

Factor 2: The Government will evaluate the usability (i.e. no broken links, etc.), relevance (i.e. articles are on topic), uniqueness (i.e. no duplication of stories), quality (i.e. authority/currency of articles, etc.), and accessibility of the sample report. 

Factor 3: The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror’s past performance information demonstrates the ability to successfully provide similar services. If there is no relevant past performance information, past performance will be rated as neutral.

Factor 4: The Government will evaluate price for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the price for the base requirement. Evaluation of options does not obligate the Government to exercise the options.

BASIS FOR AWARD

The award will be made on the basis of the overall proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government and whose technical proposal and price represent the best value to the Government. 

Factors (1), (2), and (3) are referred to as technical factors. Factors (1), (2), and (3) (when combined) are more important than Factor (4), Price. As the technical evaluation of offers approaches equality, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more offers are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced offer. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced offer if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated offer, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted. Award may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions. Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms. The right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved.
