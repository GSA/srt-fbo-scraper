The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-- (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 52.212-05 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2012) FAR (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTERS PRICE RELATED FACTORS.

As part of its quoted price, the contractor will offer:

1.0

FLAT RATE MONTHLY FEE COPYING PLAN

The Government requires Firm-Fixed Price quotes that provide Flat Rate Prices for all supplies and services sought. The term "Flat Rate Prices" means one monthly price for each Volume Band or Item throughout all months of the contract. An example of "Flat Rate Prices" is a quote of $100.00 per month for each Volume Band 1A piece of equipment for all months of the contact. This $100.00 price per month does not change throughout the contract period. Additionally, if the Government exercises its options to increase quantity or fund subsequent fiscal years, the price per additional piece of Volume Band 1A equipment will be $100.00 per month throughout the contract period.

DLA DOCUMENT SERVICES intends to enter into a Flat Rate Monthly Fee Copying Plan or Operating Lease. Ownership of equipment shall not transfer to the government at any time, including at the end of the contract.

2.0

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE

If a termination for convenience is required by DLA Document Services, the procedures and guidance set forth at FAR 52.212-4(l) will be adhered to.

A. Technical Factors

SP7000-12-Q-0061

To be technically acceptable each quote must demonstrate it meets all the Technical Factors (including all subfactors) set forth in the attached Performance Based Statement of Work and Specifications.

In order to receive a "pass" rating the quote must clearly demonstrate the ability to provide and perform all services and technical requirements described in the Performance Based Statement of Work and Specification. A quote that is evaluated as "fail" for any requirement will not be considered for award.

B. Past Performance

A past performance review will be conducted to determine whether the Government has confidence that the quoter can successfully perform the requirements set forth in the Performance Based Statement of Work and Specifications. In conducting its past performance assessment the Government may use both data provided by the quoter and data obtained from other federal Government sources. Past performance will be determined on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis.

A. Price

To ensure fair price analysis, each quoter's price for price analysis purposes will be determined by taking its grand total q uote for base period, all option periods and for options for increased quantity. (See Part 3. Price under Format and Submittal above)
