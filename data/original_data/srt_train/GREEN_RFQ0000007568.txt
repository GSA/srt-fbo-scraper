In accordance with this contract, the Contractor shall provide all management, personnel, materials, labor, equipment and facilities, except as specified herein to be furnished by the Government, and shall do all that which is necessary to satisfy the requirements listed in Part II- Statement of Work (SOW).



Pricing



All devices shall be on a 60 month (12 month base and four 12 month option periods) fixed-price operating lease with maintenance and supplies (except paper and staples) included.  All supplies and replacement parts shall be OEM factory/manufacturer authorized and all service technicians shall be factory/manufacturer authorized to perform service.



Vendor should select one of the options below for identifying and pricing excess copy charges.  Vendor should select the option where they can provide the most advantageous cost to the government without creating undue administrative burden on the government.



Option # 1: No Excess Copy/Print Charges.  This would be an all-inclusive flat fee plan.  Vendor may define and specify up to 2 volume levels/costs per band.  For example, band 3 b&w low volume (0-5,000 pages per month) and band 3 b&w high volume (over 5,000 pages per month) and provide costs accordingly.  Vendor should quote a flat fee for the lease with maintenance and supplies included (except paper & staples) for each device.  Quarterly billing is preferred, but not required.



Option # 2:  No Copy/Print Allowances.  All pages would be billed as excess.  Vendor should quote base fee for lease w/maintenance and supplies included (except paper & staples) and per page costs for both color and black & white pages for each band.  Quarterly excess billing is preferred, but not required. 

 

Option # 3:  (A) Black and White Pooled Copy/Print Allowances, plus (B) Individual Color Copy/Print Allowances.  

Monthly pooled volume allowance of (quantity to be provided by vendor) for black & white copies/prints to be used as needed across all devices.  This must be reconciled quarterly; therefore, quarterly pooled allowance of (quantity to be provided by vendor) with excess copies billed quarterly.  

Monthly allowance of (quantity to be provided by vendor) for color copies/prints on individual devices with excess color copies billed quarterly.

Vendor should quote base fee for lease/maintenance/allowance and excess per page costs for both color and black & white pages for each band.  Quarterly billing for excess required.

1052.204-8002 (OCC) REQUIRED CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (NOV 2009)


The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) uses the Central Contractor Registration database as its database for contractor information.  Accordingly, the following requirements apply to this contract.


Definitions.  As used in this clause –

"Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information require or the conduct of business with the Government.  



"Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities.



"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern.  This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying sub-units or affiliates of the parent business concern.



"Registered in the CCR database" means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4, if applicable, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number has been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed.



By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.


The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS+4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.



Failure to register in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award of an OCC contract.



Contractors will be registered in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet.  However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days.  Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.


The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete.



Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

5.0	52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)



(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.



The factors listed in section 5.1 below will be used to evaluate the offer.  



(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by comparing the total price quoted for each performance period (i.e., base and all option years). The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligated the Government to exercise the option(s).



(c)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before the award.



5.1	Basis for Award



This procurement is being solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded using procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5.  The OCC will award one contract from this solicitation to the responsible offeror (FAR Subpart 9.104) whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the OCC, price and other factors considered.  The technical evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance:



Factor 1 – Technical Capability (Pass/Fail)

Factor 2 – Delivery Schedule

Factor 3 - Past Performance

Factor 4 - Price



Where Factor 1 is the primary evaluation factor for award and where Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The OCC reserves the right to not make an award to an offeror who receives a rating of marginal or unacceptable in any of the above factors.   



5.2	ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 – Evaluation – Commercial Items



Evaluation Factors



Factor 1- Technical Capability

 

This is a Pass/Fail factor in which the technical capability shall be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror’s products clearly meet the requirements in the SOW.  

Factor 2- Delivery Schedule

 

The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s delivery schedule to determine the vendor’s ability to provide the products efficiently and in a realistic time frame.

Factor 3 – Past Performance

The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s recent and relevant past performance in providing products related to the SOW.  The Offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar work, including customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing stated goals.  If the Offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral.



Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on OCC’s experience, if any, with the vendor; the experience of references submitted by the offeror; and a consideration of other relevant facts and circumstances that are obtained by OCC from any source.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  



Factor 4 – Price


Price will be evaluated but not point scored.  The Government will evaluate the total price proposed for each performance period (i.e. base and all option years) to determine price reasonableness as it relates to the technical requirements and to assist in the best value determination.  The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced.
