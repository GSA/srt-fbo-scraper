The policies and procedures shall provide the Contractor's processes for identifying, assessing and mitigating privacy risks associated with PII. The policies and procedures shall also cover training of employees on their roles and responsibilities for safeguarding SEC PII and incident management of suspected or confirmed loss of SEC PII in accordance with OMB's Recommendations for Identity Theft Related Data Breach Notification, September 20, 2006, and OMB Memorandum M-07-16, Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information, May 22, 2007.

For purposes of this Clause, a "suspected loss of PII" shall be interpreted liberally to mean any situation in which the loss of PII or unapproved access to PII is deemed a reasonable possibility. 6014.00 Use of Contractor Data and/or Materials (Mar 2009) The Contractor acknowledges and agrees to the following: The SEC anticipates using the data and/or materials to conduct analyses for use in reports, studies, memoranda, and presentations. The SEC anticipates the following types of situations where analyses based on the underlying data may be made public: by the SEC itself (e.g., SEC rulemaking and/or analysis done as part of an inspection or enforcement action), by SEC staff where the SEC is directing or facilitating the publication (e.g., a staff study in response to a Congressional request), by SEC staff facilitating their own private publication where the Commission has not taken a position regarding the publication of the analysis (e.g., a research report to be submitted by the individual staff to an academic conference or journal), and by a former employee of the SEC who has substantially
Page 9 of 17

completed the analysis while on staff and is facilitating his/her own private publication (e.g., a research report to be submitted to an academic conference or journal). In all of these situations, only "insubstantial amounts" of the licensed data and/or materials would be made public and no raw data would be made public, the authors would agree to abide by all contractual terms and conditions, and as the owner/licensor of the data the Contractor would receive attribution and be cited as the data source. "Insubstantial amounts" means an amount that has no independent commercial value and could not be used as a substitute for the service or product or any part of it. 52.252-1 -- Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998) This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.
