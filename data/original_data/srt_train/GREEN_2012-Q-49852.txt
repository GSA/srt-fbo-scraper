Statement of Work

Health Information Service Provider (HISP) Services to implement the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) Direct Transport Protocol for the National Healthcare Safety Network  (NHSN)





BACKGROUND



The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) is a secure, internet-based surveillance system that integrates patient and healthcare personnel safety surveillance systems managed by the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) at CDC. Enrollment in NHSN is open to all types of healthcare facilities in the United States, including acute care hospitals, long term acute care hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient dialysis centers, ambulatory surgery centers, and long term care facilities.  Initially built to support 300 volunteer hospitals inputting data manually on a variety of healthcare associated infections, NHSN today is used for a multiplicity of purposes including infection control, healthcare worker safety, blood safety, process-of-care measurement and improvement, prevention research, mandatory public reporting, and public health surveillance.  Over 9000 healthcare facilities are currently enrolled and entering data into NHSN with substantially more facilities expected within the coming year.  In addition to manual data entry, NHSN is leading an effort to utilize pre-existing electronic data from Electronic Health Record (EHR) and other healthcare information systems using Health Level 7 (HL7) balloted and standardized Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents for automated data entry.   To that end, NHSN is seeking Health Information Service Provider (HISP) services to facilitate the secure transport of CDA documents from healthcare facilities to NHSN via  the NwHIN Direct Protocol.

Scope of Work

The contractor shall provide all labor, expertise, equipment, materials, and supplies to perform all services required to carry out the work under this contract.  



Contractor will deliver the following:

Provide HISP services to NHSN allowing healthcare facilities either as members of the contractor’s HISP or facilities who affiliate with other HISPs to send data securely and reliably to NHSN using the NwHIN Direct protocol.  

Support an infrastructure capable of managing up to 500 incoming messages per day with each MIME attachment less than one megabyte in size.  Also support transport level (read receipt) and/or processing level (processing errors) acknowledgements sent back to the sender for all incoming messages.

Facilities wishing to send data to NHSN via Direct can be located anywhere in the US and belong to any HISP of their choosing.  As of mid-2012 there are 400 facilities in the US with the capability of creating CDA messages to NHSN specifications with another 300 in the process of getting ready to do so.  This does not mean that all 400 will convert over to sending their CDA data via Direct.  Any facility enrolled in NHSN can upload their CDA messages manually.  It is anticipated in the first year that 100 facilities will begin to use Direct and that this number will increase significantly in coming years.  What this number will be is not known at this time.

Manage all trust relationships with other HISPs whose members wish to send data to NSHN and facilitate HISP to HISP communication in accordance with the Direct Project best practices. 

(see  )

Manage digital certificates on behalf of NHSN obtained from a Certificate Authority certified on the Federal Bridge.  (see http://idmanagement.gov/)

Provide a secure edge protocol so as to allow NHSN to automatically in a machine to machine fashion retrieve data from the NHSN Direct account and send back processing level acknowledgements.

Provide a web interface to CDC for manually sending and receiving Direct Messages for testing purposes

Execute a contract/business agreement with CDC which includes privacy and security obligations and indemnifies CDC against a breach for which the HISP is solely responsible.

Provide to NHSN a custom address domain (e.g. CDA@direct.NHSN.gov) 

Complete a security audit and penetration test on HISP technology infrastructure and provide documented results back to CDC. The security audit and penetration test should be performed annually or when major changes occur to the infrastructure. Contractor will report these findings to the project officer within two weeks of testing along with any mitigation steps should the tests indicate a vulnerability.

Provide a “White List” mechanism for NHSN to communicate to the HISP a list of direct email addresses from which NHSN will accept messages and block all others. NHSN users will register their Direct addresses inside the NHSN application.  Only registered Direct address associated with an NHSN user will be allowed to send messages to NHSN. The registration functionality of Direct addresses will be developed by the NHSN development team and is out of scope for this contract. The HISP’s role is to receive a periodic list of Direct addresses from NHSN and allow only those addresses to send files to the NHSN Direct account.

Maintain a level of server reliability of greater than or equal to 99% including down time for maintenance.  This translates to approximately 7 hours of allowable down time per month.

. 



  

The following are NOT requirements under this contract:



Anything to do with format or content of the message.  

CDC will not support Direct accounts for facilities wanting to send data to NHSN.  The contractor may in the course of normal business practice, provide HISP services to healthcare facilities wanting to send data to NHSN.  However it will be at the healthcare facility’s discretion and expense as to their choice of HISP services.  

Any development in the CDC environment (behind CDC’s firewall)



Any deployment of code in the CDC environment (behind CDC’s firewall)
