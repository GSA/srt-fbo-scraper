HSCG79-12-R-PTD035 UNITED STATES COAST GUARD STANDARD WORKSTATION (CGSWIII) COMPUTER HARDWARE EQUIPMENT STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

1.0 SCOPE The scope of this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract is to provide the entire United States Coast Guard (USCG) (which is the Headquarters and its field units) with Coast Guard Standard Workstation (CGSW) equipment to include workstations, servers, storage, and peripherals. This ID/IQ Contract will provide the ability to procure workstations, servers, storage, and peripherals that will meet the specifications and compatibility requirements of the USCG. USCG Units requiring any computer products will place an individual Delivery Order (DO). This ID/IQ Contract and all Delivery Orders will be Firm-Fixed Price. 1.1 BACKGROUND This acquisition is to obtain Information Technology (IT) equipment and the associated Original Equipment Manufacturer software that facilitates operability to allow for the continued development, support, and recapitalization of the USCG IT infrastructure in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, and the USCG Information Technology Management Strategy. The acquisition of workstations, servers, storage, and peripherals running a standard operating system and enterprise-wide applications are critical to the performance of the USCG's missions and interoperability with the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), other government agencies and for running mission essential applications (MEA) such as the Marine Information, Safety and Law Enforcement System (MISLE). The USCG is committed to a planned cyclic replacement of hardware that keeps pace with rapidly changing technology while sustaining the existing base of equipment. Maintaining old technology actually increases operations and maintenance (O&M) costs as systems fail at a higher rate, downtime increases and parts become unavailable. Without continued infrastructure modernization, the USCG will be at an increasing risk of interoperability issues with the DOD, the DHS and other government agencies as well as having difficulty in providing the public with the mandated access to maritime information.

1.2 Employee Identification. Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear
an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date. Visiting Contractor employees shall comply with all Government escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times. 1.3 Employee Conduct. The Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure Contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.

1.4 Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any contract awarded. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support the government's decision to remove an employee. 1.5 KEY PERSONNEL: Before replacing any individual designated as Key by the Government, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer no less than 15 business days in advance, submit written justification for replacement, and provide the name and qualifications of any proposed substitute(s). All proposed substitutes shall possess qualifications equal to or superior to those of the Key person being replaced. The Contractor shall not replace Key Contractor personnel without approval from the Contracting Officer. The Government may designate additional Contractor personnel as Key at the time of award. 1.6 Security: All hardware, software, and services provided must be compliance in accordance with DHS Management Directive (MD) 140-1 Information Technology Systems Security and the DHS Sensitive Systems Handbooks 4300A for SBU Systems and 4300B for Classified systems. - Security Certification/Accreditation: Information Assurance (IA) professionals in significant information security roles are required by COMDTINST 5200.3 to have a professional certification. USCG shall provide personnel with the appropriate clearance levels to support the security certification/accreditation processes under this Agreement in accordance with DHS MD 4300A, DHS Sensitive Systems Policy and Handbook. During all SDLC/SELC phases of USCG systems, USCG personnel shall develop documentation and provide any required information for all levels of classification in support of the certification / accreditation process. In addition, all security certification / accreditation will be performed using the DHS certification/accreditation process, methodology and tools. DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300 A, Section 4.1.4 requires the "Separation of duties to prevent a single individual from being able to disrupt or corrupt a critical security process." The Policy requires the following: "Components shall divide and separate duties and responsibilities of critical IT system functions among different individuals to minimize the possibility that any one individual would have the necessary authority or system access to be able to engage in fraudulent or criminal activity." Security testing is but one critical systems function that needs to be performed by a provider (either government or contractor) other than the system designer / developer / operator. This requirement is based, in part, on NIST 800-53 Rev 3, Security Control CA-2 Security Assessments - enhancement 1 which requires "The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to conduct an assessment of the security controls in the information system." Consequently, the vendor that provides C&A services may not perform the security controls testing. All hardware and software shall be Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) compatible. Interconnections between DHS and non-DHS IT systems shall be established only through controlled interfaces and via approved service providers. The controlled interfaces shall be accredited at the highest security level of information on the network. Connections with other Federal agencies shall be documented based on interagency agreements; memoranda of

Page 2 of 18

understanding, service level agreements or interconnect service agreements. COMDTINST 5500.13 requires an ISA for all interconnections. 1.6.2 All hardware and software interfaces shall be Encryption Compliant. If encryption is required, the following methods are acceptable for encrypting sensitive information: 1. FIPS 197 (Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)) 256 algorithm and cryptographic modules that have been validated under FIPS 140-2. 2. National Security Agency (NSA) Type 2 or Type 1 encryption. 3. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (see paragraph 5.5.2.1 of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) IT Security Program Handbook (DHS Management Directive (MD) 4300A) for Sensitive Systems). 1.7 Security Review. The Government may elect to conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the security requirements contained in this contract are being implemented and enforced. The Contractor shall afford DHS, including the organization of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer, the Office of the Inspector General, authorized COTR, and other Government oversight organizations, access to the Contractor's facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases, and personnel used in the performance of this contract. The Contractor will contact the DHS Chief Information Security Officer to coordinate and participate in the review and inspection activity of Government oversight organizations external to the DHS. Access shall be provided to the extent necessary for the Government to carry out a program of inspection, investigation, and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of DHS data or the function of computer systems operated on behalf of DHS and to preserve evidence of computer crime. 1.8 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The ordering period for this contract is 60 months from the date of award. 1.9 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: The primary place of performance will be the Contractor's facilities with visits to the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters Building at 1900 Half Street and 2100 2nd Street, SW, Washington, DC and U.S. Coast Guard Telecommunications and Information Systems Command (TISCOM) at 7323 Telegraph Road, Alexandria Virginia, USCG OSC Kearneysville, WV, USCG C3Cen Portsmouth, VA.

COMDTINST 4130.6A 3. DIRECTIVES AFFECTED. The following directives are hereby cancelled: a. Coast Guard Configuration Management, COMDTINST 4130.6 b. Coast Guard Configuration Management for Acquisitions and Major Modifications, COMDTINST M4130.8 c. Coast Guard Configuration Management During Sustainment, COMDTINST M4130.9 d. Coast Guard Configuration Control Boards, COMDTINST M4130.10 4. BACKGROUND. The fundamental purpose of CM is to ensure that assets meet their requirements. An asset (or product) is something that is used or produced to satisfy a need, or is the result of a process. There are certain assets and administrative types of information that the CG must have to fulfill its mission, or that specifically impact safety, security, performance, schedule, cost, or the environment. For these critical assets, the CG must have a complete understanding of the performance, functional, and physical attributes of the asset, and how those attributes tie back to mission requirements. This configuration information is paramount to making timely and effective decisions regarding mission execution, mission support, and financial stewardship, and it is therefore imperative that consistency be maintained between these critical assets, their documented configuration, and the driving requirements. CG CM Policy is intended to support CG members in achieving that imperative. a. This restatement of CG CM Policy does not so much represent a change in what is required of CG members as it does a change in how CG members must conduct CM-related activities, as well as emphasis of how important those activities are to the overall success of the CG. CG CM policy was originally designed to support a decentralized program that had both regional and area characteristics. While effective to some level, numerous studies and initiatives documented its shortcomings, and audit agencies have produced repeated Notices of Findings and Recommendation that identified a lack of standardized CM across the CG as an issue in conforming to financial, security, and safety regulations. This policy update requires a more centralized approach to CM, with standard processes that are effective between communities and across the lifecycle of critical assets, and provides that critical assets be viewed from a systems perspective, documentation about those assets be accurate and transparent, and changes to that documentation be accommodated and reflected in the asset in a timely fashion. b. The fundamental purpose of the CG CM Policy is to meet requirements and accommodate change in a fiscally responsible way.

5. POLICY. It is CG policy to maintain rigorous CM over all critical assets and critical administrative information including but not limited to boats, aircraft, cutters, C4IT systems, people (billet structures, certification requirements and documentation), plans, business processes, financial processes, information systems, hardware, software, data, platforms, facilities, equipment, Navy Type Navy Owned (NTNO) products, and all contracted CM services (including performance based logistics support). CM shall be performed by documenting requirements; maintaining consistency between critical assets and their respective critical administrative information and approved configurations; and ensuring that approved changes to configurations are reflected in the configuration documentation. Official records created and/or received as documentation will be maintained and disposed of in accordance with reference (a). No member of the CG may change the configuration of critical assets or products or critical administrative information that is owned by the CG or owned by another agency, unless the change has been approved by the cognizant 2

COMDTINST 4130.6A

Configuration Control Board (CCB) and documented in the configuration baseline. The prohibition on changing the configuration of critical assets or products or critical administrative information owned by the CG or other agencies without the approval of the cognizant CCB constitutes a general order, which is punitive in nature. Failure to comply with this order may result in disciplinary action under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for military members. Failure to comply with this order by civilian employees may result in disciplinary action in accordance with Civilian Personnel Actions: Discipline, Performance, Adverse Actions, Appeals, and Grievances, COMDTINST M12750.4 (series). See enclosure (1) for specific roles and responsibilities. a. CM Standards. The CG shall implement CM in accordance with reference (b) EIA-649A 2004 National Consensus Standard for Configuration Management with guidance from references (c), (d) and (e). See enclosure (2) for a list of the EIA-649 principles and enclosure (3) for key definitions of CM terms as they relate to the CG. References (a) through (j) are available at the CG Configuration Management site on the CG Portal. b. Baselines. Configuration of critical CG assets shall be documented in configuration status accounting tools at levels necessary to design, construct, operate, support and dispose of an asset. The level of detail documented shall be tailored and proportionate to the product's scope, importance, complexity, production quantity, performance requirements, budget, and schedule. At a minimum, the configuration baseline shall identify the product's performance, functional, and physical attributes, including internal and external interfaces. The baseline shall also include traceability of the lowest level configuration items (CIs) to the highest level requirements (i.e., a traceability matrix). Authorized deviations from an asset's configuration baseline shall be documented. c. Change Control Authority. Authority for changes to configuration baselines shall reside with cognizant CCBs. No changes shall be made to any asset under configuration control or to any configuration baseline without the approval of the cognizant CCB. d. Lifecycle Management. All CG critical assets shall be acquired, designed, constructed, operated, sustained, and disposed of in accordance with references (a), (f), (g), (h) and (i) and the approved configuration baselines. e. Standardization. The establishment of a configuration baseline for an asset shall satisfy the requirement for a standardization document in accordance with reference (j). All procurements, contracts, and acquisitions related to critical assets shall ensure that the configuration of the asset is maintained according to its approved configuration baseline. 6. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT AND IMPACT CONSIDERATIONS. Environmental considerations were examined in the development of this Instruction and have been determined to be not applicable.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic

corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

situation in which the nature of work under a government contract and a Contractor's organizational, financial, contractual or other interests are such that: (1) Award of the contract may result in an unfair competitive advantage; or (2) The Contractor's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired. (b) The Contractor agrees that if after award he or she discovers an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest with respect to this contract, he or she shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer which shall include a description of the action which the Contractor has taken or intends to take to eliminate or neutralize the conflict.

(b) Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 mandates a Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractor employees. The Common Access Card (CAC) is a personal identification card for the Department of Defense/Uniformed Services and complies with HSPD-12. The Coast Guard has instituted the CAC as its HSPD-12 compliant personal identification card for contractor and subcontractor employees who are required to access a Coast Guard, Department of Defense (DOD), or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need public key infrastructure (PKI) authentication to perform their contractual duties. The Contractor Verification System (CVS) is the automated application process for obtaining a CAC. (c) Contractor and subcontractor employees working pursuant to this contract who are required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform their contractual duties shall use CVS to obtain a CAC.

six months; revoking contractor and employee eligibility for a CAC; and confiscating a CAC when the contract expires or when a contractor or subcontractor employee stops working under the contract. (e) Current standards require a favorable fingerprint check and verification of an initiated or completed investigation for all incoming Coast Guard contractor personnel before CAC issuance. The COTR shall ensure that contractor personnel satisfy the security requirements for CAC issuance, and that completed fingerprint cards and electronic questionnaires for investigation processing are submitted to the U.S. Coast Guard Security Center (SECCEN). (f) The COTR or Contracting Officer shall provide such forms to, or request such information from, contractor employees that may be necessary for obtaining a CAC via the CVS. Completed forms and information shall be submitted as directed by the COTR or Contracting Officer. Contractors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete information. (g) Contractor or subcontractor employees who are declined a CAC via the CVS are ineligible to perform work under this contract. When an employee with a CAC is no longer performing work under this contract, the employee must return the CAC to the COTR or Contracting Officer on the same day the employee stops working. (h) The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when a subcontractor's employee is required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform contractual duties. C.23 Employee Identification a. Contractor employees visiting Coast Guard facilities shall provide two forms of photo identification.

C.25 Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons The Coast Guard may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from Coast Guard or Department of Homeland Security facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Such removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to provide sufficient qualified personnel that is required to execute the contract or any delivery orders issued under the contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written rationale for removal of the employee. C.26 Removal from Project Access Should Contractor resources be removed from any delivery order awarded under this contract, the Contractor shall ensure, via coordination with the assigned COTR and Delivery Order COTR, that a. All access to Government facilities and systems is revoked. b. The involved Coast Guard security manager(s) are notified of this removal action. c. Any and all Government property, such as identification badges, keys, information technology hardware and software, etc. in the possession of the individual(s) being removed or replaced is immediately (by close of business on the day of removal or replacement) returned to the Government or transferred to other parties replacing the removed individuals.

ˇ

In addition, it is the intent of this IDIQ to standardize the purchase of the computer hardware equipment such that all components of computer hardware will be bought from the same manufacturer for each system, i.e., laptop or desktop computer workstation. In order for the Offeror's technical proposal to be evaluated as "technically acceptable", the offeror's proposal must include a process by which to acquire and deliver Standard Workstation IT Computer Hardware equipment from the same manufacturer for all components of that system. ˇ Standardization: The Contractor will be responsible for maintaining the configuration control over all the computer equipment that is delivered to the Coast Guard. Configuration control of the equipment will be per Commandant Instruction 4130.6A. This Commandant Instruction will be incorporated into the solicitation as an attachment ­ See Attachment 9.

2. Management/Financial Capability The Government will evaluate the Offerors's Management/Financial Plan as part and parcel of the "technical acceptability" criteria for the purposes of determining how well their management/financial plan demonstrates its ability to sustain adequate resources throughout the life of the ID/IQ that will be needed to successfully meet all of the requirements. The management/financial capability proposed by the Offeror is critical to the success of this effort. Therefore, the Management/Financial plan must be explicitly explained and presented in the proposal so as to provide the USCG with a complete description of how the effort will be managed as well as remain financially sound. The management/financial plan shall provide written proof as the following: a. Does the Offeror possess the required financial capital necessary to procure the IT Computer Hardware equipment required. The Offeror shall identify their main financial banking institution and attach official correspondence from that financial institution verifying that no loan is over 30 days overdue. This requirement is pass or fail. If an Offeror fails to provide this information, it will be evaluated as technically unacceptable.

b. Does the Offeror possess the management capability necessary to manage a contract the size of this contract? The Offeror shall provide a management plan that demonstrates its ability to sustain adequate resources throughout the life of the ID/IQ contract that will meet all of the requirements. This requirement is pass or fail. If an Offeror fails to provide/submit a Management Plan, it will be evaluated as technically unacceptable. c. Does the Offeror possess Sub-Contractor and Business Partner relationships necessary to obtain the required IT Computer Hardware equipment from multiple suppliers? For large business firms, a subcontracting plan is required to reflect small business goals for small, women-owned, servicedisabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone owned. This requirement is pass or fail for large businesses only. If a large business fails to provide/submit a Sub-Contracting Plan, it will be evaluated as technically unacceptable. d. All Offerors shall provide written proof of any teaming relationships with OMB approved IT Computer Hardware equipment manufacturers/suppliers and/or distributors. Prime/Teaming Partner(s)/1st Tier Subcontractor(s) shall clearly detail each team member's roles and responsibilities, and size of business. The contractor shall also provide a list of all 1st tier subcontractors. This requirement is pass or fail. If an Offeror fails to provide/submit teaming relationships with OMB approved IT Computer Hardware equipment manufacturers/suppliers and/or distributors, it will be evaluated as technically unacceptable. 3. Past Performance The Government will evaluate the Offerors relevant past performance for prime/teaming partners/first tier sub-contractors with previous contract experience within the IT environment for purchase of IT Computer Hardware equipment for technical acceptability. Offerors should list and summarize their performance on similar or related contracts currently in progress or completed within the last three (3) years. Past performance information should be limited for teaming partners or first tier subcontractors expected to perform 20% or more of the work. Three (3) past performance examples for the prime are still expected. Submit no more than two (2) examples for each teaming partner or 1st tier subcontractor and no more than five (5) examples total. Offerors shall provide the USCG Past Performance Questionnaire (see Attachment 7) to a minimum of three (3) not to exceed five (5) references requesting the Questionnaire be completed and returned to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Cherish Driver, via e-mail at cherish.d.driver@uscg.mil before the closing of the RFP. Each offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references for the prime to include specific points of contact, e-mail addresses for those contacts, contract number, contract type, contract period of performance, and brief description of the requirement. In determining whether past performance information is technically acceptable or not technically acceptable, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type, and schedule within the Information Technology environment. Offeror(s) may be asked for additional information about problems encountered and corrective actions taken when negative information has been submitted by references. If past performance information is either not relevant or not available, then the offeror will be rated neutral (neither favorably nor unfavorably). In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via the offeror's supplied references and federal sources to include the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). To be considered relevant, the offeror must have been performed within the past three (3) years within the IT environment for purchase of IT computer hardware equipment. All information and

references are subject to verification by the Technical Evaluation Team. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the proposals received. A list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts completed during the past 3 years, a list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts currently in progress, or a combination of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts that have either been completed in the past 3 years or are currently in progress. Similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders, and/or subcontracts listed may include any contract, delivery order, purchase order and/or subcontract larger than $2,500 entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts shall list similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts as required above for proposed key personnel. Provide the following information for each contract, delivery order, purchase order, and/or subcontract: (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) (H) (I) (J) Name of Contracting Activity Contract Number Contract Type Total Contract Value Description of Contract Work to include Date of Contract and Period of Performance Contracting Officer (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. Program Manager (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. (if applicable) Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. Administrative Contracting Officer (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. (if different from F) List of teaming partners and first-tier subcontractors (if applicable)

The offeror may provide information on both problems encountered and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems on the contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts identified. The offeror should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references provided by the offeror. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over 3 years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. Past performance will be evaluated as Technically Acceptable or Technically Unacceptable. Each contract shall only be referenced once. Past performance information should be provided for the procurement directly relevant to the requirements under this combined synopsis/solicitation. To be considered relevant, the IT computer hardware equipment purchases must have been performed within the past three (3) years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the proposals received. In addition, large businesses shall demonstrate the following in order to be determined as having "technically acceptable" past performance:

a. Offerors shall demonstrate the extent to which your company attained applicable goals for small business participation under contracts requiring subcontracting plans. This requirement is pass or fail. 4. Social Economic Business Type The Government may provide socio-economic consideration to small businesses to include: small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled small businesses, HubZone small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses and/or small disadvantaged businesses in evaluation of this acquisition. At a minimum, the Government shall consider, if available, at least one small business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, HubZone small business, women-owned small business, or small disadvantaged business schedule contractor(s) when identifying contractor(s) for consideration or competition for award of this ID/IQ. If the total evaluated price of a small business offeror is between 1 to 5% higher than that of the total evaluated price of a large business offeror, consideration for award will be to the small business. 5. Price Offerors are to submit price proposals that provide complete pricing for the purchase of IT computer hardware equipment in accordance with Attachment 1 ­ Statement of Work (SOW), Attachment 2 ­ DHS Desktop Computer Salient Characteristics, Attachment 3 ­ DHS Laptop Salient Characteristics, Attachment 4 ­ DHS IT Computer Hardware Peripheral Equipment Salient Characteristics, and Attachment 5 ­ CLIN Structure/Pricing Matrix. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of overall price or reflective of an inherent lack of management and/or technical competence or comprehension of the requirements will be further excluded from evaluation. ˇ Total Evaluated Price. Price Analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. Total evaluated price will be calculated on the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers. In establishing the reasonableness of the offered prices, only information that is necessary to determine price reasonableness must be utilized. No additional information from the offeror is necessary, if the price is based on adequate price competition.

Information other than cost or pricing data that may be evaluated during a price reasonableness determination is as follows: ˇ Information related to prices (e.g., established catalog or market prices, current MSRP and/or GSA price lists or previous contract prices), relying first on information available within the Government; second, on information obtained from sources other than the offeror; and, if necessary, on information obtained from the offeror. When obtaining information from the offeror is necessary, such information submitted by the offeror shall include, at minimum, appropriate information on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price. Offeror's proposals will also be evaluated for price realism by comparing their proposed prices to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE is based on historical prices for similar products that have been procured during the last

ˇ

five years as well as MSRP/GSA Schedule pricing. Price Realism Risk may be evaluated in any Offeror's proposed prices if it is determined that the prices proposed are unrealistically low in overall price, inclusive of all ordering periods. Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical and management commitment or unrealistically low in overall price, inclusive of all ordering periods, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of management and technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements. Prices determined to be unrealistic as described herein may be considered weaknesses/risk factors in the evaluation ratings of non-price technical acceptability criteria. Offerors shall complete the CLIN Structure/Pricing Matrix ­ Attachment 5 of the solicitation including all fixed price line/sub-line items. Offerors shall calculate total for each line item by multiplying the quantity by the unit price. Offerors shall provide a subtotal for each year and an overall total price for the life of the contract. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of separately priced line items shall not obligate the Government to purchase separately priced line items. The Government may, at its discretion, accept any or all separately priced line items proposed by an awardee, if that awardees proposal for separately priced line items is sufficiently attractive. The Government fully comprehends the IT community as it pertains to downward trends in prices for computer equipment. Based on this trend, the Government anticipates seeing a reduction in unit prices for computer equipment in the out-years as required in Attachment 5 ­ CLIN Structure/Pricing Matrix. Due to the constantly changing climate within the IT community, Offerors are put on notice that Attachment 5 ­ CLIN Structure/Pricing Matrix will be incorporated as firm-fixed prices for all equipment listed therein for the life of the contract. In addition, the successful Offeror shall be responsible for updating Attachment 5 on a quarterly basis in order to take advantage of "technology refresh". The Government is well aware that information technology equipment manufacturers continue to incorporate new technology and technical advances into their product lines and to phase out obsolete equipment. In order for the Government to receive fair and reasonable pricing for "technologically refreshed" equipment, downward adjustments to unit pricing may occur; however, any unit prices proposed that are higher than the unit prices established at contract award will be negotiated downward to either match already established unit pricing or be negotiated at a lower unit price based on current MSRP/GSA published pricing and discount terms incorporated IAW IDIQ contract terms and conditions. In order for the Government to conduct annual market analysis to validate price fair and reasonableness, the successful Offeror shall provide on the anniversary date of contract award current MSRP/GSA Price Lists incorporating discounted unit prices based on the discount terms set forth in the IDIQ contract. In addition, the successful Offeror shall provide written proof of continuing teaming relationships with OMB approved IT Computer Hardware equipment OEM manufacturers/suppliers and/or distributors on the same anniversary date for the life of the contract. These deliverables are defined in Attachment 1 - Statement of Work (SOW). Offerors are invited and encouraged to submit the best price discount terms based on current MSRP and GSA pricing. Discounts will be evaluated as part of the overall evaluated price analysis. The successful Offeror's discount terms as proposed will be incorporated into the

contract terms and conditions and will be effective throughout the life of the contract. Due to the extent of the sub-Line Items under the three (3) main CLINs, 00001 - USCG Standard Workstations/Laptops and Peripherals, 00002 ­ Enterprise Servers and Peripherals, and 00003 ­ Portable Storage Devices and Peripherals, Offerors shall propose discount terms off MSRP and GSA Schedule pricing for the main CLINs which will be effective for all equipment listed as subLine Items under those CLINs. The primary means of determining the "fairness and reasonableness" of proposed prices will be through competition and the comparison of the prices offered in response to this solicitation. Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price, which meets or exceeds the requirements of this combined synopsis/solicitation. E.9 BASIS FOR AWARD ­ LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable offer conforming to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. Only technically acceptable offers will be evaluated. Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price, which meets or exceeds the requirements of this combined synopsis/solicitation. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. E.10 FAR 52.233-2 Service of Protest (SEP 2006) (Tailored) (a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from the Contracting Officer. (b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO. COMMANDANT CG-9121(WS) U.S. COAST GUARD 2100 2ND Street, SW STOP 7112 Washington, DC 20593-7112 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing

protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington DC 20593-0001 FAX: 202-475-3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695 E.11 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (APR 2012) An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via https://www.acquisition.gov .
