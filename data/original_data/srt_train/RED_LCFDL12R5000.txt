SECTION B -  SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES


Prices are firm and not subject to increase for each fiscal year performance period under this contract.  Contract period shall be for one base
year period with four one-year options through 9/30/2016.  The Government reserves the right to reopen competition to new potential contractors
annually.

Prices, services, terms and conditions found in catalogs or brochures do not apply to the extent that they modify or conflict with the prices,
services terms and conditions of this contract.  FEDLINK customers may sign basic software license agreements for products or services acquired
under this contract; however, terms and conditions of this contract, Federal Law, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) take precedence
over any such license or other agreement.  The rights and obligations provided by the contract shall take precedence over the rights and
obligations set forth in any licensing agreements provided to FEDLINK customers by the contractor.  The Agency’s incorporation of a licensing
agreement into a contract via contract modification excludes terms of the licensing agreement that contravene, modify or conflict with the
contract.  Furthermore, even if the Agency agrees to incorporate a licensing agreement into the contract, the Agency does not agree to
provisions that incorporate the following issues:  Indemnification, compliance with industry standards not imposed by law, choice of law
provisions, interest penalty payments, choice of venue or forum provisions, arbitration clauses, and provisions mandating alternate dispute
resolution.

All goods and services acquired through FEDLINK are for official government use only.  It is the customer agency's responsibility to ensure that
its employees (and contractors) are aware of and follow agency rules for using and safeguarding personally identifiable information - including
information accessed through commercial databases.


The contractual vehicles established as a result of this solicitation shall be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite  Quantity  (IDIQ)  firm-fixed  unit
price contracts pursuant to FAR 16.5.   These shall be multi-agency contracts (MACs) established in accordance with the Library of Congress  (LC)
Fiscal Operations Improvement Act, P.L. 106-481, Section 103 (2 U.S.C. §  182c.)   Any  federal  entity  including  the  executive  branch  (i.e.
Department of Defense), the legislative branch, the judicial branch, and independent agencies as well as contractors to government  agencies  who
are authorized to use federal sources of supply may be authorized to  place  orders  under  this  contract  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and
procedures described herein.  


The minimum contract amount of this IDIQ contract shall be $  tbd  .   The maximum cumulative amount that the Government may order and the
Contractor shall be required to supply under this contract is $  tbd    annually.

B.1.  PRICING PROPOSAL. All products and pricing offered must be associated with the appropriate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).  Contractor

SECTION C - STATEMENT OF WORK


C.1.  STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1.1.  OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this solicitation is to establish multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contracts (ID/IQ) for acquisition of or
access to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data analytics software applications and tools and analysis services for the FEDLINK program.  FEDLINK
is a nationwide interagency consortia sponsored by the Library of Congress (LC or The Library).  FEDLINK offers federal agencies and other
federal activities information resources and support services to help them fulfill their crucial mission of keeping the Government and the
nation informed.


C.1.2.  BACKGROUND:

Under the revolving fund created by the Library of Congress Fiscal Operations Improvement Act, P.L. 106-481, Section 103 (2 U.S.C. § 182c.), LC
uses its extensive knowledge of the information industry to establish contractual agreements for commercial information products and then makes
these agreements available to other federal agencies, information centers and other federal activities.  LC/FEDLINK contractual agreements are
established through formal procurement processes that meet the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and follow the guidance
provided by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).  FEDLINK contracting for computer-based services began in 1974 with a delegation of
procurement authority (DPA) from the General Services Administration to the Library.  Both the Office of Management and Budget and the General
Accounting Office encouraged the program's development and use by federal agencies.

LC/FEDLINK agreements are available to federal offices in the executive branch (including the Department of Defense), the legislative branch,
the judicial branch, and independent agencies.  In addition, contractors to government agencies who are authorized to use federal sources of
supply are able to purchase through FEDLINK.  LC/FEDLINK contracts meet the standards demanded by information professionals and are used by
legal offices, laboratories and information centers, analysts, scientists and other end-users in federal agencies.  FEDLINK contracts are
negotiated to achieve the lowest possible price and most favorable terms and conditions.  Contractor sales volume is considered to be an
important element to achieve maximum discounts in each contract.

FEDLINK customers may choose a “direct express” invoice relationship with contractors or a “transfer pay” option. FEDLINK provides fiscal
support to FEDLINK “transfer pay” customers.  When establishing an interagency agreement with LC to use FEDLINK services, the customer may
choose to transfer funds to LC to pay invoices for products/services ordered through the interagency agreement.  Under this "transfer pay"
option, the contractor sends invoices to FEDLINK, where FEDLINK Fiscal Operations (FFO) staff examine them, pay the vendor electronically, and
send the customer a statement of account with copies of the paid contractor invoices.  With transfer pay, the contractor only has to deal with
one government financial office and the customer is relieved of the invoice processing workload.  Terms for the direct-express or transfer-pay
options, information on delivery order/purchase order and invoice procedures are described in Section F of this contract.


C.1.3.   SCOPE:

Contractors shall offer commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) data analytics software, applications and tools that analyze large complex structured
and/or unstructured data from different data sources.  These analysis tools shall have the ability to aggregate, store, mine, analyze and
visualize large amounts of data to support the organization’s decision making.  Contractors shall provide tools that analyze raw data with the
objective of drawing conclusions, identifying trends, or obtaining insight that otherwise would remain unknown.  Products offered shall follow
industry standards and should be scalable, flexible, and customizable.  Data analytics software, applications and tools of interest are tools
that can be used in all or part of the data analytics process including data mining, manipulation, modeling, querying, reports, visualization,
statistical analysis, forecasting, text mining, text analytics, and predictive analytics.

Contractors shall be capable of providing products/services for ordering agencies with multiple organizational levels and geographic locations
nationwide and/or worldwide.  The Contractor shall also be capable of handling multiple purchase orders simultaneously.   Contracts may be
divided into three lots.  Contractors must offer products/services under either Lot 1 and/or Lot 2 in order to provide products/services under
Lot 3.   The three lots to be offered are described below.

C.1.3.1.   LOT 1 – SELF-SERVICE DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS.  Products under Lot 1 shall provide data analytics software, applications and tools for
end-users (executives, managers, scientist, analyst and front-line workers).  These self-service tools shall be intuitive, interactive and
deliver reporting and analysis functionality.  The tools shall have on-demand capabilities that allow users to:  1.) Access, explore and
interact with the organization’s data from diverse sources 2.) Perform ad hoc queries and reporting and 3.) Conduct complex analysis.  This
category of tools encompasses data exploration with visualization, dashboards, and includes data mining features to uncover hidden patterns and
relationships.  These data analytics tools shall have the ability to output data in popular formats and integrate with other commonly used
applications.  The tools shall allow users to monitor, analyze, and drill to details.

Contractors may offer integrated product suites that include query tools, dashboards and reporting software.  Interactive and dynamic data
visualization, authoring, shared collaboration, and data analysis are key capabilities desired by this group of end-users.  Visual discovery
tools make it easy for users to see trends, patterns, and outliers in data.  Data analytics software, applications and tools under Lot 1 shall
enable users to conduct exploration and discovery on their own, without relying on experts or IT personnel.  These tools shall require no
programming or specialized training.

C.1.3.2.   LOT 2 – DEVELOPERS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND TOOLS.  Contractor shall provide data analytics tools for developers, IT personnel, and
power users.  These users are the organization’s staff that has the skills to build custom applications, enterprise portals, mashups, and
analytical models for themselves, other staff members, and the organization.  These products are the data analytics software, applications and
tools that IT personnel need to easily and efficiently develop, deploy and manage large amounts of data.  The data analytics tools provided
shall offer functions to the technical staff that would assist them in data preparation, data integration and federation, metadata management,
user control and role-based access, security, score processing, creation of templates, and build and deploy models and dashboard, etc.

Contractors may offer in-memory applications, workgroup tools and sandboxes.  These users conduct statistical analysis, data mining, and
advanced analytics.  However, their primary tasks are to gather, cleanse and integrate the data, delivering a comprehensive and consistent set
of data for analytic use and properly incorporate models into business processes.  The analytics tools would require the user to process
programming skills or specialized computer training.

C.1.3.3.   LOT 3 – CUSTOM ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS.  Lot 3 is only open to contractors who qualify under Lot 1 and/or Lot 2.  Under Lot 3,
Contractors may provide organization specific solutions or a complete customized enterprise-wide solution to individual organizations.  The
contractors may work with customers to provide seamless integration of structured and/or unstructured internal and external data into the
customers’ workflow environment. Contractors may offer Data Management, Performance Management, Business Intelligence, High Performance
Analytical Platforms, Software as a Service (SaaS), Cloud Computing, Enterprise Application Integration solutions, World Wide Web and Mobile
Platforms, etc.

Contractors shall offer secure, reliable, and scalable integrated software solutions.  The goal is to deliver accurate and consistent data in a
single version of truth.  Contractors may provide tailored products and services associated with the data analytics software, applications and
tools they offer under Lot 1 and/or Lot 2.  The contractors shall address how their customer specific products will be updated and maintained.
Customer-specific offerings may be described and negotiated by the contracting office on an individual basis.



C.2.   REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL LOTS.

The contractor shall make technical support services readily available to customers across multiple time zones.  The contractor shall provide

G.2.2.      FEDLINK SERVICE OPTIONS.   LC/FEDLINK offers customers two service options for participating in the FEDLINK program:

G.2.2(a)  Direct Express.  Under the Direct Express option, customers send their agency generated purchase order directly to the contractor.  An
interagency agreement between the customer and LC is not required and the customer does not pay the FEDLINK administrative fee.  The contractor
provides service, invoices the customer directly against the agency purchase order, and the contractor pays the FEDLINK administrative fee.
Direct Express processes are described in detail in section G.3.

G.2.2(b)  Transfer-Pay.  Under the transfer pay option, a customer transfers both FEDLINK administrative fees and estimated annual service
dollars to LC via a signed interagency agreement or other LC-approved customer agency document authorizing the transfer of funds to LC.  On
behalf of the customer, LC/Contracts issues a delivery order to the contractor in the amount specified on the interagency agreement or funds
transfer document.  After receiving the delivery order, the contractor provides service to the customer and submits the customer's invoices to
FEDLINK.  FEDLINK reviews the invoices, rejects improper ones, and pays acceptable ones from the customer's account.  FEDLINK sends the customer
copies of rejected invoices, copies of all paid invoices, and a regular account statement.  The customer reviews the invoices and reports any
irregularities to FEDLINK, who resolves them with the contractor.  Transfer pay processes are described in detail in section G.4.

Contractors are required to offer the Transfer-pay option to FEDLINK customers.  Contractors are not required to offer the Direct Express
option.



G.3.  DIRECT EXPRESS PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS

G.3.1.      INITIATING DIRECT EXPRESS SERVICE.

G.3.1(a)  Delivery order/purchase order from customer.   Customers may send delivery orders or purchase orders directly to the contractor.  The
order shall reference the LC/FEDLINK Contract number, the RFQ number, and the Statement of Work with the specific products/services to be
acquired.

G.3.1(b)  Beginning Service.  The contractor shall not begin, renew, or convert to the LC/FEDLINK Contract any service for any FEDLINK customer
until a purchase order for that FEDLINK customer for that service for the current fiscal year has been received.  The contractor shall contact
the customer to begin service immediately upon receiving and accepting the customer's purchase order.  Subsequently, the contractor shall
invoice the customer directly against the purchase order received.

G.3.1(c)  Customer Identification.  After receiving the customer’s order, all contractor correspondence with FEDLINK regarding the FEDLINK
customer shall identify the customer by the agency office to which service is provided, the agency delivery/purchase order number, Point of
Contact, phone number, and the FEDLINK ID (if available).


G.3.2.      CONTRACTOR REPORT OF DIRECT EXPRESS SALES.

G.3.2(a)   The contractor shall report the quarterly dollar value (in U.S. dollars and rounded to the nearest whole dollar) of all Direct
Express sales under this contract by government fiscal year quarters (i.e., October-December, January-March, April-June, July-September).  The
dollar value of a sale is the price paid by the FEDLINK customer for products and services on a FEDLINK contract Direct Express
delivery/purchase order, as recorded by the contractor.   The reported contract sales value must include the FEDLINK funding fee as referenced
in section G.3.3.

G.3.2(b)   The contractor shall report the quarterly dollar value of sales on the FEDLINK quarterly report as provided in the contract, to the
contracting officer via email.  If no sales occur, the contractor must show zero on the report for each quarter.  The report is due 45 days
following the completion of the reporting period.  The contractor must also provide a close-out report within 60 days after the expiration of
the contract.  The contract expires upon physical completion of the last, outstanding purchase order of the contract.  The close-out report must
cover all sales not shown in the final quarterly report and reconcile all errors and credits.  If the contractor reported all contract sales and
reconciled all errors and credits on the final quarterly report, then show zero sales in the close-out report.



G.3.3.      FEDLINK DIRECT EXPRESS FUNDING FEE.


G.3.3(a)  The contractor shall pay LC/FEDLINK a program funding fee for all Direct Express customers.  This requirement is incorporated into all
orders that reference this contract.  The FEDLINK funding fee reimburses the Library of Congress FEDLINK program for the costs of operating the
Direct Express program and recoups the program’s operating costs from ordering activities.  Contractors may include the fee in the prices
offered.  The fee is included in the contract award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities.  Contractors must
remit the fee in U.S. dollars within 45 days after the end of each quarterly reporting period as established herein, see Contractor Report of
Direct Express Sales (G.3.2).  The fee equals 0.75% (three-quarters of one percent) of total quarterly Direct Express sales reported.

NOTE:   The contractor is not required to pay the fee for any Transfer-Pay customers.  The ordering activities or FEDLINK customers pay the
program administrative fee when transferring funds into an LC/FEDLINK account.  Delivery orders issued by LC/FEDLINK on behalf of transfer-pay
customers are not subject to the fee.

G.3.3(b)  The contractor shall pay the fee amount due by electronic funds transfer through the Automated Clearing House (ACH), to LC/FEDLINK.
If the payment involves multiple FEDLINK customers, the contractor may consolidate the fees into one payment.  To ensure that the payment is
credited properly, the contractor must identify the electronic transmission as a "FEDLINK Funding Fee" and include the following information:
contract number(s), report amount(s), and report period(s).  The contractor must contact the FEDLINK Vendor Services Coordinator as listed in
section G.4.3.(b) to make arrangements for payment by electronic funds transfer.

G.3.3(c)  If the full amount of the fee is not paid within 45 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period, it constitutes a
contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR 32.6.  The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Act
of 1982, including withholding or setting off payments and interest on the debt (see FAR 52.232-17, Interest).

G.3.3(d)  The contractor shall remit any monies due as a result of the close-out report required at the time the close-out report is submitted.

G.3.3(e)   If the contractor fails to submit sales reports, falsifies sales reports, or fails to pay the FEDLINK Funding Fee in a timely manner,
the Government may terminate or cancel this contract and all orders issued hereunder.  Willful failure or refusal to furnish the required
reports, falsification of sales reports, or failure to pay the fee in a timely manner constitutes sufficient cause for terminating the vendor
for cause under the termination provisions of the contract.

G.3.4.      INVOICE PAYMENT FOR DIRECT EXPRESS CUSTOMERS.    The contractor shall invoice customers directly against their agency
delivery/purchase orders as specified on the agency order.   LC/FEDLINK shall not process invoices for Direct Express customers.


G.4.  TRANSFER-PAY PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS

G.4.1.      REGISTRATION.  Customers indicate their intent to use LC/FEDLINK contracts by completing the online registration form on the FEDLINK
website at www.loc.gov/flicc , indicate how they intend to transfer service dollars to LC, and establish the funding level for their
products/services by submitting an annual FEDLINK registration form.  Prospective customers may register any time during the fiscal year until a
cutoff date specified by FEDLINK.


G.4.2.      CUSTOMER INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS.   Customer agencies initiate interagency agreements with LC for products/services through the
registration process.  To constitute valid agreements all documents must be signed/accepted both by the requiring agency and by LC/FEDLINK.
After LC signs and returns the interagency agreement, the LC Office of the Chief Financial Officer (LC/OCFO) invoices the agency for the funds
obligated to LC.  LC/Contracts issues delivery orders to the contractors listed in the amounts specified on the interagency agreement.  Upon
receipt of the delivery order the contractor may initiate service for the customer.  Customers may request amendments to their interagency
agreement orders during the year (until a cutoff date specified by FEDLINK), and thus may add or delete products/services and/or change funding
levels.  LC/Contracts issues delivery order modifications accordingly.


G.4.3.      INITIATING TRANSFER PAY SERVICE.

G.4.3(a)  FEDLINK Delivery Order.  LC/Contracts issues a delivery order to the contractor for each FEDLINK customer using the contractor's
service in the transfer pay mode under the LC/FEDLINK contract.  LC/Contracts may also issue delivery order modifications that reflect
amendments to customers' interagency agreements - to change products/services or adjust funding levels, for example.  Upon receipt of the
official LC delivery order, the contractor may begin service for the customer under the terms of the current contract.  The contractor shall not
begin, renew, cancel, or convert to the LC/FEDLINK contract any service for any FEDLINK customer until a delivery order for that customer for
that service for the current fiscal year has been received.  The contractor shall not provide products/services to the customer in excess of the
"not to exceed" (NTE) dollar amount indicated on the original delivery order or as amended by any delivery order modification.  The Government
is not liable for products or services provided which exceed the NTE dollar amount.  Contractors shall invoice only for supplies delivered or
services performed -- the NTE amount on the delivery order may be an estimated price and not the final price for supplies or services ordered.
Authority to provide service under an LC delivery order expires on September 30 of each fiscal year unless specifically stated otherwise on the
delivery order.

G.4.3(b)  Order Acceptance and Notification.  The contractor shall inform FEDLINK Fiscal Operations (FFO) in writing of any account
identification or user identification the contractor has assigned to the customer within a reasonable time from receipt of delivery orders from
LC/FEDLINK Contracts.  This notification confirms the contractor’s acceptance of the order under this contract.  Performance under any FEDLINK
delivery order constitutes contractor’s acceptance of all contract terms and conditions.  Upon receiving the order, the contractor shall contact
the customer immediately to begin service.  If the contractor questions an order, the questions shall be noted on the delivery order and the
delivery order returned to LC/FEDLINK Contracts within ten (10) days.  Send customer identification via fax or email to the following address:

      The Library of Congress
      FEDLINK Fiscal Operations
      ATTN:   James Oliver, Vendor Services Coordinator
      John Adams Bldg., Room LA-224
      101 Independence Ave., SE
      Washington, D.C.  20540-4935
      Fax #:  202-707-4999;  Email:  joli@loc.gov

G.4.3(c)  Customer Identification.  FEDLINK assigns a unique four-character FEDLINK ID to each customer.  After receiving the delivery order,
all contractor correspondence and oral communications with FEDLINK regarding customers shall identify the customer by the FEDLINK ID and
delivery order number for the customer as indicated on the delivery order.  The contractor may also assign its own account numbers, user IDs or
other identifiers to customers, but may not use these identifications instead of the FEDLINK ID.


G.4.4.      FEDLINK INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS.     An invoice is the contractor's bill or written request for payment under the delivery order for
supplies delivered or services performed.  The contractor shall invoice only for the amount of supplies delivered or services performed as the
NTE amount on the delivery order may be an estimated price and not the final price for supplies or services ordered.   FEDLINK's transfer pay
accounting service is intended to help FEDLINK customers manage the Government funds entrusted to them legally, efficiently, and effectively.
FEDLINK simplifies processing and achieves economies of scale for both customers and contractors.  However, with centralized, third party
processing there can be delay in reporting to the customer.  Therefore, it is important that the contractor cooperate with FEDLINK Fiscal
Operations (FFO) to ensure that invoices, usage reports, credits, and refunds are submitted within 30 to 45 days and are complete and accurate.
 The contractor shall prepare invoices and submit them to FFO Invoice Processing, as addressed on the delivery order, for review and processing.
 FFO will forward approved invoices to LC/OCFO for payment.  All proper invoices (except summary invoices) and all detailed usage reports shall
include the information specified below and be formatted as specified below.  Invoices that do not meet these specifications are defective.  FFO
will reject them and return them to the contractor without payment.  Invoices for products/services that exceed the funding level authorized on
the delivery order will be rejected for insufficient funds and returned to the contractor without payment.  FEDLINK will not make partial
payments to accommodate customer funding levels.  Rejected invoices will be accompanied by a form indicating the reason for rejection.  The
contractor shall promptly resubmit the invoice when the condition(s) causing the rejection have been corrected.  All inquiries relating to
FEDLINK vendor payments should be directed to:

           FEDLINK Fiscal Operations
           ATTN:  Invoice Processing
           Telephone:  (202) 707-4961
           Fax:  (202) 707-4927; Email:  locfliccap@loc.gov


G.4.5.      INVOICE INFORMATION.  The contractor shall supply the following information on all invoices:

G.4.5(a)  Invoice Data Elements.
      (1)   Contractor identification:
            •  Name and address of the contractor.
            •  LC/FEDLINK Contract Number.
            •  Two-character FEDLINK Service ID assigned to the contractor.
            •  Name and address of the contractor official to whom payment is to be sent via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) (shall be the same
                       as designated in the Contract).
            •  Contact information for person to be notified in event of defective invoice.
      (2)   Customer identification:
            •  FEDLINK ID
            •  Customer identification [see Sec. G.4.3.(c)].  If no user ID or account number is assigned by the contractor, it should be stated
                       on the invoice.
           •  Name and address of agency using services
            •  FEDLINK Delivery order number
      (3)   Order information:
            •  Order date in mm/dd/yyyy format.  Order date is the date the FEDLINK customer placed the order with the contractor and must be
                       within the funding year of the corresponding Delivery number cited.
            •  Invoice number.   Invoice number should uniquely identify the invoice.
            •  Invoice date in mm/dd/yyyy format.
            •  Contract line item number, where practicable, or descriptive information sufficient to identify  Schedule B item which
                       corresponds to invoiced item.
            •  Description, quantity, unit, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed.
            •  Discount applicable to individual FEDLINK customers, either by line item or against the invoice total, as appropriate.
            •  Any prompt payment discount.
            •  Any other information or documentation required by other specific requirements elsewhere in the Contract (such as evidence of
                       shipment, receipt or prepayment)
            •  An invoice copy submitted as replacement for an original shall be certified as a duplicate original.

G.4.5(b)  Invoice Number.  Individual invoices shall have unique numbers.  Any invoice (including credit invoices) with a number which
duplicates another invoice's number is defective and will be rejected.

G.4.5(c)  Fiscal Year of the Invoice.  An invoice reflects individual items/services ordered by the customer in accordance with an authorized
delivery order.  The fiscal year to which an invoice must be charged is governed by the delivery order number, not by the contractor's invoice
date.  Thus, items ordered on September 30th against a current delivery order will be charged to the current fiscal year, even though they may
not be delivered and invoiced until after the next fiscal year has begun.  It is therefore extremely important that the delivery order number
and order date be clearly identified on the invoice and that it correctly reflect the fiscal year with which the particular item orders are
associated.  Invoices for subscriptions shall be clearly distinguishable from reports of usage under the subscription (for which no additional
payment is due.)  The contractor shall not combine charges from separate fiscal years on a single invoice.

G.4.5(d)    Discounts.  Discounts earned by individual customers shall be calculated on the individual invoice or institution detail for the
FEDLINK customer.  FFO is not responsible for any recalculations to distribute discounts due individual customers.  Prompt payment discount
options approved in the Contract shall be specified on invoices. The option to take a prompt payment discount shall be exercised at the
Government's option.


G.4.5(e)  Pagination.  Each page included as part of the invoice(s) must be numbered to indicate their sequence. (example:  1 of 5, 2 of 5,
etc.)


G.4.6.      INVOICE TYPES.

G.4.6(a)  Individual Invoices.  The contractor shall supply a separate invoice for each FEDLINK customer as represented by a FEDLINK ID.  The
contractor shall clearly distinguish between an invoice for a subscription for which payment is due from a report of usage under the
subscription (for which no payment is due.)

G.4.6(b)  Summary Invoices.  The contractor may submit a summary invoice with line items for each FEDLINK customer.  Summary invoices must be
supported by customer-specific detail that enables FFO to review the charges and confirm the amount due from each customer and enables the
customer to confirm that goods/services have been received and that the charges are accurate.

G.4.6(c)  Refunds, Credits or Other Adjustments.  All invoice adjustments for transfer pay customers shall be processed through FFO.  FFO shall
determine whether a credit to the customer's account is acceptable or whether a refund is required.  Where credits are acceptable, the
contractor shall issue separate credit invoices for all accrued credit on an individual customer's account and shall indicate on the credit the
information specified above, plus the following:  reference to the original invoice number, original order date, description of credit, credit
total.  Invoice adjustments shall have a unique invoice number; the invoice number of the original invoice being adjusted shall not be re-used.
Where refunds are required, the contractor shall promptly remit amounts due.

G.4.6(d) Duplicate Invoices.  The contractor shall certify that it has not already received payment for duplicate invoices submitted as
replacements for original invoices as follows:

            Duplicate Original
            Payment Not Received
            Signed ______________________
            Date  _______________________

G.4.6(e)  Faxed, Emailed and Altered Invoices.  In cases when an invoice is faxed, emailed or altered, the contractor shall certify that it has
not already received payment for the faxed, emailed or altered invoice(s) submitted as replacement of original invoice(s) as follows:

I certify that this is a copy of the original invoice in which payment has not been received.

           Signed___________________
           Date____________________

Note:  Faxed and Emailed invoices are accepted on a case by case basis only.  We recommend that you submit all invoices via mail as outlined in
G.4.7 (e)

G.4.6(f)  Resubmitted Invoices.  The contractor shall promptly resubmit a rejected invoice when the condition(s) causing the rejection have been
corrected.  The contractor shall resubmit the original invoice and shall clearly identify that the invoice is a resubmission for payment.

G.4.6(g)  Electronic Invoicing.  As FEDLINK expands the capabilities of its automated accounting system, it may be possible to accept invoice
data electronically via Internet file transfer.


G.4.7.      INVOICE SUBMISSION.

G.4.7(a)  Promptness.  The contractor shall invoice FEDLINK within thirty (30) to forty-five (45) days after providing authorized service to the
customer.  Receiving prompt, current financial data to help them manage the information services they provide their agencies is very important
to FEDLINK customers.  Withholding invoices for authorized users (especially at the beginning of the fiscal year) is not acceptable.

G.4.7(b)  Frequency.  The contractor shall invoice FEDLINK on a regular cycle.  Exceptions are allowed only by prior written  mutual agreement
between the customer and contractor.

G.4.7(c)  Sort Order.  The contractor shall submit invoices sorted first by fiscal year, then alphabetically by FEDLINK ID, followed by invoice
number order.  Mixing invoices for different fiscal years, not sorting by FEDLINK ID or other data elements slows FFO processing and is not
acceptable an invoices will be rejected and returned to the contractor unprocessed.

G.4.7(d)  Number of Copies.  For each FEDLINK transfer pay customer, the contractor shall provide FFO not less than one original and one copy of
each invoice and not less than one original and one copy of each detailed usage report (in support of the invoice).

G.4.7(e)  Physical Format.  Individual invoice sets shall be attached so that all copies and/or pages of the original invoice remain contiguous.
 If the contractor supplies photocopies of any pages (e.g., to supplement a multi-part invoice), then all invoice photocopies shall be attached
to the original invoice.  Invoices printed on continuous paper sets shall be stripped of letter edge perforation guides.  Invoices shall be
stripped of any interleaved carbon inserts.

G.4.7(f)     Invoice Address.  The contractor shall submit invoices to the following address:

            The Library of Congress
            FEDLINK Fiscal Operations
            ATTN:  Invoice Processing
            101 Independence Ave. SE
            Washington, DC  20540-4935
            Fax: (202) 707-4927

G.4.7(g)  Final Invoice Call.   FEDLINK is required to close customer accounts for prior fiscal year obligations against appropriations and
funds scheduled for retirement.   FFO issues a final invoice call to contractors each fiscal year to initiate the close-out of prior year
contracts.   Contractors must submit the final invoices to FFO within 90 days from notification.


G.4.8.   INVOICE REVIEW AND PAYMENT.   For purposes of this clause, "invoice payment" means a Government disbursement of monies to a contractor
under a contract or other authorization for supplies or services accepted by the Government.  This includes payments for partial deliveries that
have been accepted by the Government and final costs or fee payments where amounts owed have been settled between the Government and the
contractor.  Payment shall be considered as being made on the day a check is dated or an electronic funds transfer is made.  All days referred
to in this clause are calendar days.  The designated billing office for transfer pay accounts is LC/FEDLINK.

G.4.8(a)  Return of Improper Invoices.   If the invoice does not comply with requirements herein, then the contractor shall be notified of the
defect within 25 days after receipt of the invoice at the designated billing office.  Untimely notification by the Government shall be taken
into account in the computation of any interest penalty owed the contractor in the manner described in paragraph G.4.9 of this contract.
Rejected invoices shall be accompanied by a form indicating the reason for the rejection and may be resubmitted when the condition(s) causing
the rejection is corrected.

G.4.8(b)  Invoice Adjustments.  The Government may adjust invoices to remove charges not valid and not payable under this Contract, such as line
items for excluded products/services, sales tax, freight charges, and prior month billing.  FEDLINK will not make partial payments to
accommodate customer funding levels.

G.4.8(c)  Payment Due Date.  The due date for making invoice payments shall be the later of the following two events:
      (1)  The 30th calendar day after the designated billing office has received a proper invoice from the contractor.  If the payment due date
      falls on a weekend or holiday, payment will be made on the following business day.

      (2)  The 30th day after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed by the contractor.  On a final invoice where the
      payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of the contract
      settlement.  However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment
      due date shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the date the contractor's invoice is dated, provided a proper invoice is received and
      there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.

G.4.8(d)   Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) (FAR 52.232-34, MAY 1999).  In accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act, all FEDLINK
payment to contractors shall be made via electronic funds transfer (EFT).  The contractor shall complete the "Vendor Survey Form" obtained from
LC FEDLINK Contracts to provide the information necessary to transmit payments to the contractor's financial institution.  Payment shall be
considered as being made on the effective date of the EFT.

G.4.8(e)  Remittance Advice.  FFO shall provide the contractor contact identified in this Contract with a remittance advice that details the
invoices for which payment is covered by LC/FEDLINK payments.  Currently, FFO e-mails the remittance advice to the contractor's Accounts
Receivable contact a few days before the EFT payment is completed. The contractor should use the remittance advice to update its accounts
receivable records.  If an e-mail address is not on file, the remittance will be faxed.


G.4.9.      INTEREST PENALTY PAYMENTS.

G.4.9(a)  Conditions for Interest Payment.  An interest penalty shall be paid automatically by the designated payment office, without request
from the contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in this clause are met, if applicable.  An interest
penalty shall not be paid on agreements issued to foreign contractors outside the United States for work performed outside the United States.
Conditions for interest payments are:

      (1)  A proper invoice was received by the designated billing office in a timely manner.

      (2)  A receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment was processed and there was no  disagreement  over  quantity,
      quality, or contractor compliance with any contract term or condition.

      (3)  In the case of final invoice for any balance of funds due the contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was
      not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the contractor.

G.4.9(b)   Interest Rate.  The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 USC 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date, except where the interest penalty is prescribed by
other governmental authority.  This rate is referred to as the "Renegotiation Contracted Interest Rate," and is published in the Federal
Register semiannually on or about January 1 and July 1.  The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the invoice principal payment amount
approved by the Government and shall be compounded in 30-day increments through the payment date, with the first 30-day period beginning the
first day after the due date.  That is, interest accrued at the end of any 30-day period shall be added to the approved invoice principal
payment amount and be subject to interest penalties if not paid in the succeeding 30-day period.  If the designated billing office failed to
notify the contractor of a defective invoice within the periods prescribed above, then the due date on the corrected invoice shall be adjusted
by subtracting from that date the number of days taken beyond the prescribed notification of defects period, as set out below.  Any interest
penalty owed the contractor shall be based on the adjusted due date.  Adjustments shall be made by the designated payment office for errors in
calculating interest penalties, if requested by the contractor.

G.4.9(c)  Acceptance for Interest Purposes.  For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the contractor, Government
acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred constructively on the 15th day (unless otherwise specified in the agreement) after the contractor
delivered the supplies or performed the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement, unless there is a disagreement
over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with a contract provision.  In the event that actual acceptance occurs within the constructive
acceptance period, the determination of an interest penalty shall be based on the actual date of acceptance.  The constructive acceptance
requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make
payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

G.4.9(d)  Periods Not Subject to Interest.  The following periods of time shall not be included in the determination of an interest penalty:

      (1) The period taken to notify the contractor of defects in invoices submitted to the Government, but this shall not exceed 25 days.

      (2) The period between the defects notice and resubmission of the corrected invoice by the contractor.

      (3) For incorrect EFT information, in accordance with the EFT clause of this agreement.

      (4) Interest penalties shall not continue to accrue after the filing of a claim for such penalties under the FAR clause at 52.233-1,
      Disputes, or for more than one year.  Interest penalties of less than $1.00 need not be paid.

      (5) Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to disagreement between the Government and contractor over the payment amount
      or other issues involving contract compliance or the amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract.
       Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be payable, shall be resolved in accordance with the FAR clause at 52.233-1,
      Disputes, as amended by the Library.

G.4.9(e)  Interest on Discounts Taken Improperly.  An interest penalty shall also be paid automatically by the designated payment office without
request from the contractor, if a discount for prompt payment is taken improperly.  The interest penalty shall be calculated as described above
on the amount of discount taken for the period beginning with the first day after the end of the discount period through the date when payment
is made to the contractor, if the underpayment is not corrected within 15 days of the expiration of the discount period.



G.5.  EXAMINATION OF CONTRACTOR RECORDS BY THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS


The contractor agrees that the Library of Congress or any duly authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any
books, documents, papers and records of the contractor involving transactions related to this contract for over-billings, billing errors, and
compliance with the Program Funding Fee clause of this contract. This authority shall expire 3 years after final payment.


G.6.  FEDLINK SERVICES TO CONTRACTORS.

G.6.1.      PUBLICITY.   LC/FEDLINK shall inform FEDLINK customers about the products/services available under the program.  Currently, the
FLICC/FEDLINK World Wide Web site has a section devoted to products/services available to FEDLINK that includes brief descriptions of the
products and services offered by FEDLINK contractors, contractor contact information, and active links to contractor e-mail and websites.  The
contractor is invited to submit its contact and link information for inclusion in this web-based FEDLINK products/services catalog.

G.6.2.      MAILING LISTS.    A mailing list of FEDLINK customers can be provided to the contractor upon request to the address below.

            The Library of Congress
            FEDLINK Fiscal Operations
            ATTN:   James Oliver, Vendor Services Coordinator
           John Adams Bldg., Room LA-224
            101 Independence Ave., SE
            Washington, D.C.  20540-4935
            Phone: 202-707-4360; Fax #:  202-707-4999; Email:  joli@loc.gov
G.7.  CONTACT FOR CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION.  The contractor shall designate a person to serve as the contract administrator for the contract and
orders placed under the contract both domestically and overseas.  The contract administrator is responsible for overall compliance with contract

SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

H.1.  CONTRACTING OFFICER’S REPRESENTATIVE.

A Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may be designated to represent the Contracting Officer for the purpose of coordinating with the
contractor in administering the technical aspects of performance for a particular Customer's account.   For Transfer-Pay Customers, the
Interagency Agreement (IAA) point-of-contact as identified on the delivery order will serve as the COR for the requiring agency unless otherwise
notified.  For Direct-Express Customers, the COR shall be as designated on the direct-express notification or Customer agency purchase order.
The COR may issue written or oral instructions to fill in details in the scope of work set forth in the contract via the Contracting Officer.
The COR is not authorized, however, to make any changes that affect the contract amounts, terms and conditions of the contract or any order
issued under the contract.  The LC Contracting Officer is the only party authorized to make any changes that affect the terms and conditions of
the contract or orders or to bind the Library of Congress.


H.2.   USE OF LIBRARY OF CONGRESS NAME OR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP IN ADVERTISING.

The contractor agrees not to refer to awards from or contracts with the Library of Congress and/or the FEDLINK program in commercial advertising
in such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service provided is preferred by the Library of Congress or is superior to other
products or services.  The contractor also agrees not to distribute or release any information that states or implies that the Library of
Congress endorses, uses, or distributes the contractor's product or service.


H.3.   NEWS RELEASES.

News releases pertaining to this contract and resultant delivery orders shall not be made without LC/FEDLINK approval, as appropriate, and then
only upon written approval received from the contracting officer.


H.4.   MOST FAVORED CUSTOMER PRICE.

The contractor warrants and agrees that the prices charged LC/FEDLINK users under this contract will not exceed the prices charged by the
contractor to its most favored customer for the same item or services in like or comparable quantities; and further agrees, that any payments
received for charges made in excess of prices paid by such most favored customers will be returned to the Government.


H.5.   PROMOTION OF CONTRACT.

The contractor shall promote this contract to all current FEDLINK customers and federal agencies, as well as other eligible customers during the
life of the contract.  The contractor’s goals shall be to: (a) make customers aware of this procurement vehicle; (b) make customers aware of all
available products and services; and c) assist customers in creating timely and accurate delivery order/purchase orders.  The FEDLINK Logo may
be used for this purpose in accordance with the provisions of Section H.2.


H.6.    COPY OF CONTRACT AND PRICE SCHEDULE.

Upon request, the contractor shall provide customers with at least one copy of the contractor’s current LC/FEDLINK contract or Price Schedule.
Electronic accessibility to price schedules is required.  All contract and pricing information supplied to customers shall be identical to the
current contract.


H.7.   CUSTOMER  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REGARDING CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE.

This clause applies to all contracts estimated to exceed $25,000.  Customer agencies are required to submit a past performance evaluation form
at the completion of each fiscal year or contract performance period (see attachment J.2).  The contracting officer will provide copies of any
reports received to the contractor, and the contractor will have 30 calendar days from receipt to submit a rebuttal and/or a report of
corrective actions taken.   The past performance evaluation will be placed in the contractor’s past performance file and will be available to
any federal agency upon request for a period of 3 years.


H.8.   CONTRACTOR  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

H.8.1. QUARTERLY SUMMARY OF FEDLINK USER ACTIVITY.  The contractor shall submit quarterly the agency name, point-of-contact (POC), and total
dollars obligated for the services provided under this contract.  The contractor may use the sample FEDLINK Quarterly Summary Report format
provided (see attachment J.1).  Reports shall be submitted in  Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and shall be sent via email to the Contracting
Officer as listed in section G.1.3.  To facilitate FEDLINK reporting of usage, reports shall provide the following information:

           ( Agency name
           ( Agency point-of-contact (POC) and telephone number
           ( FEDLINK ID
           ( Delivery order number
           ( Delivery order Not-to-Exceed (NTE) Total
           ( Fiscal year amounts received for each customer
           ( Current quarterly dollars expended for each customer

H.8.2.  DEADLINE.  The reports shall be received in the FEDLINK Contracts Office within forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of the
particular reporting fiscal year quarter.

H.8.3.  FAILURE.  Failure on the part of the contractor to comply with this requirement shall constitute an "incomplete package" for invoicing
purposes for transfer pay customers and no payment shall be made to the contractor until the reports are received.


H.9.   CANCELLATION  OF CONTRACT

Either party may cancel this contract in whole or in part by providing written notice.  The cancellation will take effect 30 calendar days after
the other party receives the notice of cancellation.  If the Vendor elects to cancel this contract, the Government will not pay the minimum
guarantee.


H.10.  CONTRACT SALES CRITERIA

A contract will not be awarded unless anticipated sales are expected to exceed at least $25,000 for a 1-year period.  Any resultant contract may
be canceled in accordance with the Cancellation clause above, unless reported sales are at least $25,000 for a 1-year period.


H.11.    COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 508.

Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C.§794d), federal agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to technology that is
comparable to the access available to others.  The law applies to all federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic
and information technology.  Inaccessible technology interferes with an individual's ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily.
Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and
to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals.  Contractors are responsible for providing federal customers with
all necessary information as reasonably requested regarding product compliance with Section 508 requirements.


H.12.   LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

Contractors frequently have license agreements for their electronic data and software products.  Some licenses are for the contractor's
proprietary products; other licenses simply pass-through terms established by the originator.  The designated COR for each delivery order may
sign license agreements in accordance with section H.1 for the products/services that agencies acquire through LC/FEDLINK contracts.  The
products/services are used in the requiring agency and the licenses are signed and enforced by the requiring activity itself.  This means that
licenses may be reviewed by the agency's attorneys, contracting officers, or other appropriate officials.  Licenses that are ill-suited to
federal customers are likely to have difficulty being approved.

Customers and contractors are free to negotiate license terms as they pertain to the usage of the products/services acquired.  Such individual
licenses shall only pertain to the customer for whom they were negotiated.  Contractors must consider that individuals legitimately associated
with the requiring activity must be able to use the information technology and tools the agency intends to provide for them. Upon request,
FEDLINK shall assist contractors and FEDLINK customers in negotiating licenses to be applied in their local environments.  Licenses presented
when users logon to a system that instruct the user to "Click here to accept" or otherwise interactively agree to a standard license, do not
supersede the terms of this contract.

Working with customers, FEDLINK has identified common commercial license terms that are likely to be unacceptable to local officials and terms
that are impractical for federal agencies to implement. FEDLINK requests that contractors adapt their commercial licenses for FEDLINK customers
by modifying the relevant clauses, by including a special section for the federal market, or by prefacing the license with language such as the
following:

All of the terms and conditions set forth in this license agreement are governed by the language of FAR 52.212-4, as well as the terms of the
FEDLINK contract.  In the event any language in the terms and conditions of this license conflict with the governing FAR clauses or other
federal law, the FAR clauses and federal law take precedence.

The rights and obligations provided by the contract shall take precedence over the rights and obligations set forth in any licensing agreements
provided to FEDLINK customers by the contractor.  The incorporation of a licensing agreement into a contract excludes terms of the licensing
agreement that contravene, modify or conflict with the contract.  Furthermore, even if the government agrees to incorporate a licensing
agreement into the contract, the government does not agree to provisions that incorporate the following issues:  Indemnification, compliance
with industry standards not imposed by law, choice of law provisions, interest penalty payments, choice of venue or forum provisions,
arbitration clauses, and provisions mandating alternate dispute resolution.

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR
database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor.

(b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established

shall be modified accordingly.

(c) If the Contractor’s applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be
increased, upon the Contractor’s written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and

(1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price.

(2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective—

      request within 10 days thereafter; or
      (ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request.
(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the
increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or
negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause.
(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the
increase in the applicable established price.
(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor’s written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any
undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.

(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation,

       Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $50,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request
       for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim. The submission may be converted to a claim, by complying with the
       submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a
       reasonable time.
      (d)
      (1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after
      accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject
      to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
      (2)   (i) The contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim
      exceeding $50,000.
           (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
           (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are
           accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment
           for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the
           Contractor.”
      (3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within
60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify
the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive unless, the Contractor appeals, within 90 days of receipt of a
Contracting Officer’s decision, to the Government Accountability Office Contract Appeals Board, 441 G Street N.W., Room 7182, Washington, D.C.
20548.  Facsimile:  202-512-9749;   E-Mail:  CAB@gao.gov.
(g) Interest Penalty.  Claims shall not be assessed interest penalty.
 (h)  The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim,
appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.
                                                                 (End of Clause)

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—
    (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
    (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;
    (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]
    (1) Listed end products.

indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
  (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly—
    (1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds
the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
    (2) o Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with

that—
      (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or

subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly

period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or
(k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

select the optimum proposal or proposals.

shall be submitted in Section B in the format provided and shall constitute the total firm-fixed unit price for that service or deliverable.
