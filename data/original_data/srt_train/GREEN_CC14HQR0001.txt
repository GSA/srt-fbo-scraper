The contractor shall initiate an IPP enrollment.  

The contractor shall send an email to (see NOTE in the 4th bullet point) and include the required information about the contractor’s company listed in the bullet points below.  

The contractor shall include in the email subject line “IPP Payment Notification Services” and shall include the following information:

Name of company*; 

Primary company mailing address*;

Primary company phone number;

Designated IPP account administrator for your company: first name, last name, phone number, email address (NOTE: The request to register for an account must come from the designated IPP administrator's email address.  Failure to do so shall result in the contractor’s request being denied); 

Taxpayer Identification Number(s) (TINs) used for OCC payments;

Name of government agency doing business with the contractor**; 

Contract number (list only one); and

Point of contact information at the OCC (i.e., name, phone, email to verify that the contractor is an OCC supplier).**

*If the contractor has more than one location or company name, the contractor shall use its primary corporate information and location data to enroll with the IPP. 



**This information is necessary to verify that the contractor is a supplier to the OCC.



After an account is established, the Contractor will receive two emails. 

The first email will provide the contractor with a User Identification (ID);

1052.242-8000(OCC) Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Dec 2010)



The OCC will evaluate the contractor’s performance after contract award.  If this contract has option periods, interim evaluations will be conducted at the end of each option period and then a final evaluation report will be prepared at the completion of the entire contract.  If this contract does not have renewal options, an evaluation will be conducted upon completion of the contract. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Contracting Officer may conduct evaluations more or less frequently, if the Contracting Officer deems appropriate.

Evaluations will be conducted using an electronic format as established by Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), an internet-based database of contractor performance information.  The OCC will enter the information, gathered from the evaluation, into the CPARS.  

If the contractor responds to the evaluation, and the response rebuts any or all of the ratings, the Contracting Officer will attempt to reconcile the areas of disagreement with the contractor.  If agreement cannot be reached, the evaluation and response shall be reviewed at a level higher than the Contracting Officer and a final evaluation will be issued by the reviewing official.  If the reviewing official finds, either all or in part, against the contractor, the contractor’s response shall become part of the final evaluation.  The reviewing official’s final decision shall not be subject to dispute under the terms and conditions of the Disputes clause or subject to resolution in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Alternative Dispute Resolution clause.  The reviewing official will provide the contractor with a copy of the final evaluation.

Any government agency authorized to access the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database will be able to view the performance information related to this contract.  Any government agency may also receive a copy the contractor’s performance evaluation, and any associated comments, by contacting the OCC.  The OCC will also, upon request, provide copies of any and all of the contractor’s evaluations to the contractor. 

(End of Clause)



1052.243-8001 (OCC) Authorized Changes Only By The Contracting Officer (SEP 2012)



	(a)  Except as specified in paragraph (b) below, no order, statement, or conduct of Government personnel who provide technical direction or in any other manner communicates with contractor personnel during the performance of this contract shall constitute a change under the “Changes” clause of this contract.

	(b)  The Contractor shall not comply with any order, direction or request of Government personnel unless it is issued in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer (CO), or is pursuant to specific authority otherwise included as a part of this contract.

	(c)  The CO is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements of this contract and notwithstanding provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely the CO’s.  In the event the Contractor effects any change at the direction of any person other than the CO, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in charges incurred as a result thereof.  The CO will be identified via separate letter to the contractor.



(End of Clause)



1052.342-8000 (OCC) Contractor’s Commitment to Equal Opportunity in Employment and Contracting (APR 2012)



Contractor confirms its commitment to equal opportunity in employment and contracting. To implement this commitment, the Contractor shall ensure, to the maximum extent possible consistent with applicable law, the fair inclusion of minorities and women in its workforce. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in all subcontracts under this Contract when the dollar value exceeds $150,000. 



Within ten (10) business days of a written request from the OCC’s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI), or such longer time as the OMWI determines, and without any additional consideration required from the Agency, the Contractor shall provide documentation, satisfactory to the Agency, of the actions it (and, as applicable, its subcontractors) has undertaken to demonstrate its good-faith efforts to comply with the aforementioned provisions. 



For purposes of this contract, “good-faith efforts” may include actions by the contractor intended to identify and, if present, remove barriers to minority and women employment or expansion of employment opportunities for minorities and women within its workforce. Efforts to remove such barriers may include, but are not limited to, recruiting minorities and women, providing job-related training, or engaging in other activities that could lead to those results.



The documentation requested by the OMWI may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:



1. A written affirmative action plan or other written program designed to ensure the fair inclusion of minorities and women in the contractor’s workforce, including outreach, recruitment, and training efforts whereby the contractor sets forth specific, results-oriented policies and procedures.



2. A list of subcontract awards under the Contract categorized by dollar, date of award, and the subcontractor’s ownership status, including whether the subcontractor is minority-owned (by race and/or ethnicity) or women-owned.



3. Documentation similar to that described in paragraph 1 with respect to each subcontractor.



4. Any other actions demonstrating the contractor’s or subcontractor’s good-faith efforts to include minorities and women in its workforce.



Consistent with Section 342(c)(3) of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (PL 111-203) (Dodd–Frank), a failure to demonstrate to the Director of the OMWI such good-faith efforts to include minorities and women in the Contractor’s workforce (and, as applicable, the workforce of its subcontractors) may result in termination of the Contract for default, referral to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or other appropriate action.



For purposes of this clause, the terms “minority,” “minority-owned business” and “women-owned business” shall have the meanings set forth in Section 342(g) of Dodd–Frank.

IT Accessibility





Service Provider

Self Assessment















































1.0 – Executive Summary



The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires all service providers to have the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities to effectively maintain accessibility within all Information Technology (IT) products and services delivered in order to ensure delivery to OCC will meet the needs of the end-users, including those with disabilities.



This publication is based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d) which requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.  Additionally, it requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities



Once completed, this self assessment will be analyzed by OCC IT Accessibility Program (ITAP) personnel to provide OCC’s contracting officer with a preliminary assessment of the respondents IT Accessibility proficiencies, company knowledge, skill, ability, and tools to implement and maintain accessible solutions.  In addition, any commercially available product or service will be evaluated and verified to determine its level of accessibility.



Explanation of terms, concepts, and other items related to IT accessibility requirements can be found in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of this publication.
2.0 - Instructions



The self-assessment questionnaire must be filled out by staff responsible for, and knowledgeable of all products or services, management, operational, and technical standards related to IT accessibility that is being recommended as a response to OCC solicitations for an IT solution.



The OCC requires attestations for all self assessments made by its service providers.  It is the responsibility of the service provider (respondent to the solicitation) to ensure that any commercially available product being offered or recommended is fully evaluated, and any supporting documentation, including 3rd party documentation provided by the vendor of the commercially available product is accurate.  



Once completed, the questionnaire must be reviewed and approved by a senior officer of the organization.  Sections 3.0 through 6.0 must be completed which includes a formal attestation letter (Appendix A), and must be submitted as part of any official response to the request for proposal, statement of work, and/or other contracting document.



For each commercially available product that is being recommended as part of a solution, Appendix B must be completed and submitted for review.



Please review the checklist in table 1 below to ensure completeness prior to final submission.




3.0 – IT Accessibility Questionnaire

3.1 – Product or Service Overview

Organizations must ensure that IT products or services used, maintained, developed or procured meet specific Functional Performance Criteria, Technical Standards and Information, Documentation and Support Criteria resulting in the accessibility for all end-users, including those with disabilities.






3.2 – Knowledge, skill and ability of the Service Provider

Organizations must maintain IT products and services that continually meet the needs of the existing and future workforce as well as members of the public, which includes individuals with disabilities.  This requires service providers to the organization to have the knowledge, skills and abilities to develop and maintain accessibility within IT solutions.






3.3 – Testing Methodology, Tools and Results

Organizations must ensure newly acquired or modified IT products and services meet IT Accessibility standards at all times. Test results must be predictable, measurable and repeatable.









3.4 – Functional Performance Criteria Disclosure

Organizations must specifically support Functional Performance Criteria for users  identified by 36 CFR 1193.31 a-f, commonly accomplished by applying technical standards identified by 36 CFR 1194.21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26.



NOTE: All of these “Apply” – Please use the comments area to explain answers.











3.5 – Applicable Technical Standards Disclosure

Organizations must follow Technical Standards, used interchangeably regardless of type of technology, to meet the Functional Performance Criteria with rare exception.  For instance, when Web solutions utilize dynamic technical approaches such as Flash, , DHTML, then both “Web & Software” standards would be applicable, interchangeably.



Identifying and Confirming Applicable Standards:






3.6 – Information, Documentation and Support Disclosure

Organizations must ensure that information, documentation and support services are delivered in an accessible format to those with disabilities, manageable within internal records management systems, and publishable through both Intranet or Internet as needed.






3.7 – Operations and Maintenance

Organizations must ensure that operations, updates and modifications, including regression issues to IT services maintain accessibility and comply with all Technical Standards, Functional Performance Criteria and Information, Documentation and Support Criteria.






4.0 – FAQ’s



(1) Why does OCC require its service providers to complete this self assessment questionnaire? The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended requires that all Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) procured, developed, maintained or used by OCC meets specific Technical Standards, fulfills specific Functional Performance Criteria, and makes Information, Documentation, and Support services available to individuals with disabilities.

 

(2) As a service provider, why is it required that we conduct our own testing, including third party vendors we propose within a solution? It is highly recommended that any product you recommend as part of your solution meets requirements outlined in a solicitation.  Accessibility is a significant part of those requirements and ultimately the service provider selected will be expected to meet the requirements as documented.  



(3) Why do some standards titled “software” apply to a “web” deliverable?  Existing standards were written when most Web applications were static or simple HTML.  In later years, the Web became much more dynamic to deliver information and functionality in a method that would not meet “Functional Performance Criteria” by using “Web” standards alone.  Failing to meet the Functional Performance Criteria would prohibit the use of the application within Federal service. Cross-referencing standards has proven to overcome challenges and meet the Functional Performance Criteria, allowing for the newer technologies to be used.



(4) What if this is a new topic to me and it’s unknown how accessible a product or service is? If selling to the Federal Government is desired, then it is highly recommended that you seek knowledge, whether is from a third party company who specializes in this field.  Accessibility is a law that affects all of Government IT systems, not just OCC.

Background



The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires a vendor to provide a convenient, electronically accessible web-based and relational database application-based dataset consisting of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) for (1) credit ratings on publicly rated debt for both issuers and issues, and (2) corporate default and debt recovery data.  The OCC will use the information to analyze credit ratings on publicly rated debt, default and corporate debt recovery data.  Databases shall contain the following: (1) current ratings, (2) historical ratings and credit rating migrations, and (3) historical default and corporate debt recovery data.



Scope of Requirement



At a minimum, the debt rating datasets shall include the following information:



Debt ratings, debt instruments, obligor’s characteristics and default events



Rating information for all instruments of each issuer and debt issue (e.g. senior unsecured debt ratings for individual bonds and loans).

Information on the terms and characteristics of individual debt issue (e.g. facility type, seniority, terms of debt issue, Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIPs) identifiers, maturity and issue dates, collateral types, covenants, coupon rates and payment information, an covenant information).

Details of issue specific events (e.g. effective rating dates, rating withdrawal dates, and default status).

Details of issuer specific characteristics (e.g. industry, geography, links to CUSIP identifiers, and default status).

Information on the method of calculating default rates (i.e. formation of cohorts, time horizon and treatment of outliners). Information shall provide the OCC users the ability to modify and compute for custom segments (i.e. time periods, industries, and geographies). 



Corporate debt recoveries and bankruptcy settlements



For a given obligor’s default, dataset shall include information on the recovery rate or loss given default rate for each instrument.  The recovery rates shall be calculated based on the trading price of defaulted debt securities (i.e. emergence prices of pre-petition instruments, or prices of instruments at settlement) and final recovery settlements.  The data shall include discounted recovery information and information on the total family recovery (e.g. total recovery rate for all of obligor’s outstanding debt). 

The data shall include information on the obligor’s capital structure at default and the relation of a particular instrument to the capital structure as a whole (e.g. percent of debt senior or debt subordinate to each debt instrument).

The database shall include information on debt identifies such as CUSIP identifiers which would allow linking recovery data to external databases.

Information shall be capable of being linked to other vendor models used by the agency for quantifying Probability of Default (PD) such as the Kamakura default probability model. 



 The vendor shall provide:



Documentation of the developmental evidence, modeling approach, validation and processes used in creating and updating the dataset.

Datasets to include data transactions that date back to 1980.

Updated monthly datasets.  Changes to the data or the inclusion of new data shall be clearly identified in each update.

Datasets to be Section 508 Compliant and accessible to allow OCC employees to extract the datasets and convert them into a standard database program owned by the OCC.  These database programs include Stata, SAS, Access, Excel, Matlab, NLOGIT, SPSS, and Eviews.  The OCC employees shall be able to share the dataset with other OCC employees, regardless of the location. 

Analytical expertise in the areas of distressed debt and/or loss given default.  

Technical support to OCC users of the dataset to include guiding OCC users through the use of the data.  Vendor shall provide documentation that addresses both data and functionality.



Accessibility Requirements



Solution must be meet the applicable IT Accessibility requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  OCC has determined that the following applicable standards shall apply:



36 CFR 1194.21 – Software Applications and Operating Systems

36 CFR 1194.22 -  Web based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications
