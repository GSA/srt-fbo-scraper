TBDFA4452-14-Q-0033 Attachment 2 ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 "EVALUATION ­ COMMERCIAL ITEMS" BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD The Government intends to award one contract for the Backup Satellite Communications Secure Entry Point (SEP) requirement. However, the Government reserves the right to make no award at all. The Government will select the quotation with the lowest evaluated price from among those meeting the acceptability standards for the non-price factor. Procedures outlined in FAR 12.6, as supplemented, will be used for evaluations and award. A contract may be awarded to the contractor who is deemed responsible in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.1, as supplemented, whose quotation conforms to the solicitation's requirements. While the Government evaluation team and Contracting Officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following factors: ˇ ˇ Price Technical Rating

First, the Government will rank the quotes from lowest price to highest price. Starting with the lowest priced quote, the Government will evaluate the technical quotation based on an acceptable or unacceptable basis. The Acceptable and Unacceptable definitions are as follows: Acceptable: Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Unacceptable: Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. If the lowest priced quote is technically acceptable, this contractor's quotation represents the best value to the Government and the evaluation process is complete at this point. Award shall be made to that contractor without further consideration of any other contractors. If the lowest priced quote is not technically acceptable, the Government will consider the correction potential of the quotation and may enter into negotiations with that contractor. If after negotiations with that contractor, their quote is technically acceptable and their quotation remains the lowest priced, the contract shall be awarded to that contractor without further consideration of any other quotation. If the Government deems the quotation not easily correctable, or if at any time their quote becomes other than the lowest priced quote, the next lowest priced quote will be evaluated for technical acceptability. Negotiations will take place as necessary or deemed appropriate by the Government. The evaluation process will continue until reaching a technically acceptable quote. As described above, the Government may negotiate with one or more contractors; however, the Government is not required to negotiate with any or all contractors submitting a quote. Furthermore, the Government will not negotiate with more than one contractor at a time. ASSUMPTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND EXCEPTIONS If your company takes exception to any of the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) or terms/conditions of this RFQ, they must be clearly identified in your quote. These will be reviewed for potential impact on your ability to successfully meet the Government's
1

FA4452-14-Q-0033 Attachment 2 requirements. Any assumptions, conditions or exceptions which may negatively impact performance of this requirement could render the quote ineligible for award.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) United States Air Force Air Mobility Command Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AMC/A2) Backup Satellite Communications Secure Entry Point (SEP)

1. Background. The AMC Director of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AMC/A2) has a requirement for the installation of a backup KLAS Telecom Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) Satellite Secure Entry Point (SEP) to support existing and future KLAS manufactured PiONEER Express fly-away kits. AMC/A2 is currently in the process of transitioning to the SEP system purchased by AMC/A2 in late FY13. Furthermore, AMC/A2 has discovered the current planned backup SEP is unreliable. The AMC/A2 backup SEP must be 100% compatible with the current primary AMC/A2 SEP. The primary AMC/A2 SEP is being installed on the AMC/A2 Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) Domain. AMC/A2 personnel will ensure the proper C & A procedures are followed. The vendor will provide training to the AMC/A2 personnel to sustain operational control of the backup SEP. This SOW provides a concept of the tasks required to install a full backup KLAS SEP at a geographically separated site from Scott AFB ensuring SIPRNet access for the deployed flyaway kits in case the primary SEP fails. An exact detailed report would be the output of a planned Site Survey and development of the Telecommunications Systems Installation Plan (TSIP). The site survey will be conducted upon award of the installation contract. 2. Objectives. AMC/A2 has a requirement for "first hour" communications. The reliability obtained through the operational control of a primary and backup AMC/A2 SEP, and the use of the PiONEER Express BGAN satellite terminals give AMC/A2 the ability to accomplish critical command and control (C2) intelligence mission support. 3. Scope. AMC/A2 requires services, non-personal, to design, procure, and install a new, backup KLAS Telecommunication Services BGAN SEP to support existing and future KLAS manufactured PiONEER Express fly-away kits. The requirements include installing and integrating all equipment necessary, to provide secure satellite communication at the "SECRET" classification level. The design and installation of the backup SEP will include installing and programming new equipment to meet the required capabilities. The contractor will be responsible for the selection, procurement, installation, and setup of all hardware and equipment necessary to complete the tasks defined by this SOW. A High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) device, KG-255 or equivalent, will be provided by AMC/A2. The AMC/A2 COMSEC Manager will obtain the appropriate key for the HAIPE device. AMC/A2 will provide equipment rack space and electrical power requirements. AMC/A2 will obtain the dedicated public internet accessibility circuit. A sight survey will be needed by the contractor to identify the rack space and power requirements at the backup site. The effort will include any labor, equipment, hardware, and wiring needed to interconnect the backup SEP equipment to the AMC/A2 SIPRNet domain. At the completion of the tasks, the contractor will provide training on the operation and maintenance to AMC/A2 personnel to sustain operational control of the backup SEP.

Specific Tasks and Services addressed in this SOW are: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Task Area 1 ­ Perform Site Survey Task Area 2 - Install, configure, and test the AF/AMC KLAS BGAN Backup SEP Task Area 3 - Provide Warranty Task Area 4 - Provide Training
