      Description of Services: Prior to content going live on government sites, the law requires that all content meet Section 508 compliance
      requirements as documented at: http://section508.gov/. This task will support evaluating on-line content, training, PDF documents, and
      other web-based materials to determine Section 508 compliance and identify any issues. While all interactions must have a keyboard
      equivalent to be accessible to users that do not employ a pointing device there are multiple ways to accomplish this and automated tools
      often fall short or are misleading.

      Deliverables: A detailed Section 508 compliance report documenting any outstanding issues with recommended corrective actions and proposal
      documenting the costs to take the corrective actions. Note that this in not an automated run from a software application, but rather an in-
      depth analysis of the issues a user would encounter.

      GoLearn portal content management system. This infrastructure development will include a custom agency header, unique agency instance on
      the shared server environment, Admin and public URLs, and the database meta-sites. Agencies will receive access to the back-end admin sites
      to be able to create and edit on-line content that can be viewed in the associated public sites. The training for agencies to be able to
      manage and use this environment to create and deliver their own courses is defined in Task 8.0
