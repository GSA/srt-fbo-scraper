Program Description



TRICARE is the Department of Defense (DoD) health care program administered by the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) by means of the Military Health System (MHS) for approximately 9.6 million active duty and retired members of the Uniformed Services (the U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps, the U. S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service and the Commissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), their spouses and children, including TRICARE for Life beneficiaries entitled to Medicare Part A and Part B based on their age, disability and/or end-stage renal disease.  Also eligible are Medal of Honor recipients. TRICARE is authorized under 32 CFR 199.21 and Chapter 55 of Title 10 USC Section 1074g. 



The mission of the MHS is to enhance DoD readiness and national security by providing health support for the full range of military operations. The MHS must be prepared not only to provide a high quality, cost-effective health care benefit to its eligible members during peacetime, but also must be prepared to support the armed forces during exercises, contingencies, operations other than war, and in wartime.  The MHS provides quality medical care through: (1) a network of health care providers and pharmacies in the United States and its territories; and (2) direct care Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) – (hospitals, health and dental clinics) in the Continental United States and overseas. The number and size of direct care facilities has declined in recent years, it remains important that MTFs are optimized in order to maintain the clinical skills of military clinical staff to support medical readiness. The direct care system cannot fully support the total demand for health care services; therefore, TRICARE uses the direct care system as the main delivery system, and through contracts, augments the direct care system through a civilian network of providers and facilities serving its eligible members.

TRICARE provides a world-class pharmacy benefit to all eligible beneficiaries through the integration of state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness.  DoD administers an integrated TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program offering pharmacy services through direct care pharmacy services at MTFs located at various military bases; retail network pharmacies; authorized retail non-network pharmacies; or delivery through the TRICARE Home Delivery/Mail Order Pharmacy (TMOP).  Retail network pharmacy services are available in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  



Features of the pharmacy benefits program include the use of the DoD Uniform Formulary; a tiered cost sharing structure; and a preference for generic over branded products.  The DoD formulary is managed by the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (P&T) and lists the pharmaceutical agents, by therapeutic classes, that are authorized as basic program benefits.  Prescriptions for selected pharmaceutical agents may be subject to prior authorization or utilization review requirements to assure medical necessity, clinical appropriateness and/or cost effectiveness.  DoD has established tiered cost-sharing by which beneficiaries partially defray costs of administering the pharmacy benefits program.  Cost-sharing amounts differ based on the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, or non-formulary, in conjunction with the point of service from which the agent is acquired. 



The mail and retail portions of this benefit are open to all eligible TRICARE beneficiaries. Eligible beneficiaries need not enroll in order to use the program(s). In addition to TRICARE beneficiaries, certain patients of the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) may also be eligible to have prescriptions filled at one or more points of service under the TRICARE Pharmacy Program.



 DVA patients will be eligible to have prescriptions filled at TRICARE retail network pharmacies in circumstances when the patient requires immediate therapy and there is no DVA pharmacy available to provide the medication. DVA beneficiaries are not eligible to obtain prescriptions from the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy or from retail pharmacies that are not part of the TRICARE retail pharmacy network.





Under this TRICARE Pharmacy (TPharm4) contract the contractor will perform pharmacy benefits management functions, including the following: perform claims adjudication, administer a retail pharmacy network, operate a Mail Order Pharmacy (MOP), provide clinical services for specialty pharmaceuticals, process direct member reimbursements for claims filled at retail network and non-network pharmacies, administer paper claims, perform clinical reviews and provide beneficiary and pharmacy support services.  The contractor shall transmit all claim information to the Pharmacy Data Transaction Service (PDTS), the government’s designated data warehouse. 



The contractor will also perform as a fiscal intermediary on behalf of DoD to pay for all authorized pharmaceuticals and supplies dispensed for eligible beneficiaries at retail pharmacies. Government funds, either appropriated or derived from the Medicare-eligible Retiree Health Care Fund, will be used by the contractor to pay for all TRICARE prescriptions dispensed by network and non-network retail pharmacies. The contract will be paid fees at the contracted rate for performing administrative services under the contract. The fees paid to the contractor will not be related directly or indirectly to the Government’s acquisition costs of pharmaceuticals under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or Section 201(a) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. The contractor will issue payment using Government funds to pay for each TRICARE prescription dispensed at retail network pharmacies after receiving the Government’s verification of the individual beneficiary's eligibility and authorization for payment. Therefore, the Government will be acquiring covered drugs and procuring them for the use of the Federal Government in support of this contract with Government funds.

For denied paper claims, notification to the beneficiary must be in writing, and must explain why the order or claim was denied, detailing the beneficiary's appeal rights. Each prescription processed will generate an individual TRICARE Encounter Data (TED) record in accordance with the TRICARE Systems Manual.



Retail Network Pharmacy Services for DVA Beneficiaries



DVA beneficiaries will be eligible to have prescriptions filled at TRICARE retail network pharmacies in circumstances when the patient requires immediate therapy and there is no DVA pharmacy available to provide the medication. This occurs with outlying Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) and at off hours, where a supply of medication is needed to initiate therapy until the remainder of therapy can be mailed from the DVA’s Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP).  DVA beneficiaries are only authorized the dispensing of emergent need medications when prescribed on a DVA prescription blank stating “Authorized for Emergent Need.”  DVA beneficiaries are not eligible to obtain prescriptions from the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy or from retail pharmacies that are not part of the TRICARE retail pharmacy network.



The contractor shall utilize the DVA’s eligibility database to verify eligibility prior to authorizing retail network pharmacies to dispense prescriptions to DVA beneficiaries. The contractor shall ensure that network pharmacies verify that the prescription is on a DVA prescription blank stating “Authorized for Emergent Need.” If a DVA beneficiary has questions about eligibility for services, the contractor shall tell the beneficiary to contact their primary care provider at the DVA facility.



The contractor shall bear the cost and burden of establishing the communications interface with DVA’s eligibility database and shall ensure that the interface meets DVA security requirements. Eligibility queries will utilize NCPDP standards as required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 



The contractor shall authorize network pharmacies to fill prescriptions for DVA beneficiaries for any pharmaceutical agent that is covered under the TRICARE retail pharmacy benefit regardless of the status of the pharmaceutical agent on the DoD Uniform Formulary. The status of a pharmaceutical agent on the DoD Uniform Formulary, the DoD co-payment requirements, the DoD prior authorization requirements, the DoD Medical Necessity Determination requirements, and DoD recoupment requirements do not apply to prescriptions filled for DVA beneficiaries. The contractor shall ensure that network pharmacies do not collect co-payments from DVA beneficiaries.



The contractor shall apply the DoD quantity limits and the DoD mandatory generic policy to prescriptions filled for DVA beneficiaries, except that Coumadin® will be dispensed for prescriptions for

warfarin sodium, Dilantin® will be dispensed for prescriptions for phenytoin sodium, Synthroid® will be dispensed for prescriptions for levothyroxine and Cordarone® will be dispensed for prescriptions for

amiodarone.



The contractor shall deny paper claims received for prescriptions filled for DVA beneficiaries at non-network pharmacies. If a non-network retail pharmacy fills a prescription for a DVA beneficiary, the DVA beneficiary is responsible for payment to the pharmacy in full.



The contractor shall not mail TPharm educational materials to DVA beneficiaries, unless specifically authorized to do so by the DVA through the TPharm Contracting Officer.



Retail Pharmacy Network



The contractor shall establish and maintain a retail pharmacy network throughout the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. 

The contractor shall provide network retail pharmacy services in American Samoa, when there are pharmacies in American Samoa with NCPDP numbers which are then eligible to become TRICARE network pharmacies. The contractor shall establish a pharmacy network which meets the following minimum access standards, referring to definitions provided in TRICARE Operations Manual, Appendix B: 



Urban: a pharmacy within two miles estimated driving distance of 90% of the beneficiaries.

Suburban: a pharmacy within five miles estimated driving distance of 90% of the beneficiaries. 

Rural: a pharmacy within fifteen miles estimated driving distance of 90% of the beneficiaries.



All network pharmacies shall be fully licensed in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, and have a current NCPDP number. Pharmacies providing pharmaceuticals solely through Internet or mail order pharmacies shall not be included in the retail network.



Retail pharmacies who offer to mail prescriptions to beneficiaries as part of their business may be included in the network subject to the retail pharmacy specifications listed herein. 



The contractor is required to adjudicate current and future claims received from DVA, Public Health Service (PHS), and Indian Health Service (IHS) pharmacies identified by the Government.  Reimbursement for pharmaceuticals dispensed through these pharmacies will be directed by the Government. These Pharmacies will be reimbursed at acquisition cost plus a Government negotiated dispensing fee. These pharmacies shall not be included in the measuring of performance under the 

network access standards nor in the calculation of the guaranteed reimbursement rates. 



The contractor shall ensure that network pharmacies have procedures to reasonably assess the validity of prescriptions ordered by telephone.



At a minimum, the retail pharmacies shall provide TRICARE beneficiaries the same quality of services provided to beneficiaries of other commercial clients to the extent allowed by Federal regulation and this contract.



The contractor shall ensure that all pharmacies document the receipt of the medication by the beneficiary or the individual authorized by the beneficiary, in accordance with all applicable State and Federal Laws.



Retail Network Changes



When pharmacies are removed from the contractor’s retail pharmacy network, the contractor shall notify beneficiaries who have filled prescriptions at the impacted pharmacies during the previous 6 months. 



To minimize the impact of network changes, the contractor shall perform the following steps. 



No later than 60 days prior to the effective date of the change, the contractor shall:

Provide the government with the names of all pharmacies selected for removal from the network.

Identify the number of DoD beneficiaries who have filled prescriptions at these pharmacies within the previous 6 months by the following categories:

Specialty Medications

Limited Distribution Medications

Hemophilia Medications

Other Non-Specialty

Provide a plan of action detailing how impacted DoD beneficiaries will be notified of the change. The plan shall include, at minimum, the following elements:

Advance notification to all beneficiaries who have filled prescriptions at the impacted pharmacies. 

Outreach by letter, phone and/or other electronic to beneficiaries utilizing specialty, limited distribution and hemophilia medications. 

Provide the government with a sample of all beneficiary correspondence related to the change in the network for review, no later than 30 days prior to the effective date of the change

Provide reporting on the contractor’s success in shifting beneficiaries to network pharmacies or the MOP.



For purposes of the report, a successful transfer will be defined as documentation that a new claim for the specialty medication has been submitted by an approved network pharmacy, mail order pharmacy, or Military Treatment Facility (MTF); a review by a pharmacist has determined that a similar therapeutic entity has been substituted; or based on the therapeutic entity itself, it can be reasonably assumed that therapy has been completed.



When preparing the report, the contractor shall evaluate the effectiveness of its action in reach all beneficiaries and make changes to the plan as necessary to prevent disruption of therapy for the maximum number of beneficiaries possible.



At 180 days after the effective date of the change, the contractor shall provide a final report of all beneficiaries that have not been successfully transferred and a full accounting of all efforts made to contact that patient, including dates attempted and contact methods employed.

MTF Claims



The TPharm contractor shall be connected to the DoD MHS electronic medical record, currently Composite Health Care System (CHCS) pharmacy/AHLTA, as described in Section C.12. 



CHCS pharmacy/AHLTA first verifies MHS beneficiary eligibility through an interactive check with the DEERS, then forwards the prescription data to the TPharm contractor for ProDUR before filling the prescription.   The TPharm contractor shall return ProDUR response information to the CHCS host, which interprets it and provides the necessary information to the submitting pharmacy.  The TPharm contractor shall receive dispensing transactions and profile inquiry transactions from all MTFs and MTF pharmacies. The TPharm contractor shall perform ProDUR on the inbound dispensing transactions and returns the requested data on profile inquiries. All traffic shall be logged and dispensing transactions are transmitted to the data warehouse. 



The contractor shall support messaging to the MTF that varies from that used by the commercial network.



Mail Order Pharmacy



The contractor shall support MOP registration by a variety of means, including but not limited to submissions in writing, via telephone, or via the contractor’s web site. 



The contractor shall accept prescription orders at the mail order pharmacy by written (original or facsimile), electronic (supporting digital signature including e-prescribing), or telephonic submission. The contractor shall have procedures in place to reasonably assess the validity of prescription orders submitted by telephone.



MOP prescription processing and written notification of denied orders shall meet the following minimum requirements:



Mail order prescriptions shall be shipped, returned, or denied within an average of 5 days from receipt, date stamped in accordance with TRICARE Operations Manual Chapter 8, Section 1. 

Prescriptions dispensed from the MOP shall be accurate 100% of the time, measured monthly.

In the event the contractor fails to mail any prescription that did not require clarification or intervention within 7 days, the contractor shall automatically provide next day delivery service at no additional charge to the beneficiary. 



For each MOP prescription received requiring clarification or intervention, the contractor shall contact the prescriber as appropriate. If the contractor is unable to obtain a response from a prescriber, they shall contact the beneficiary telephonically or by electronic means, based on the beneficiary’s indicated preferences. The contractor shall provide order status and request beneficiary direction to either hold the prescription for fill or to cancel.  The beneficiary shall have no less than 72 hours to provide a response before the prescription is returned.  The contractor shall document all calls, and the beneficiary’s direction.    The contractor shall not return a prescription without first attempting to contact the beneficiary. 



For beneficiaries in deployed theaters of operation, the contractor shall dispense medications as indicated in section C.7.8. 



For beneficiaries not in deployed theatres of operation the contractor shall provide notification by telephone or other electronic means, based on beneficiary preference, of prescriptions received, placed in a pended status, and the anticipated processing date for each.



The contractor shall pend prescriptions in lieu of rejecting early submissions.  



For all denied mail order prescriptions, notification to the beneficiary must be in writing explaining why the order was denied and detailing the beneficiary’s appeal rights.  



For beneficiaries receiving prescription medications through the MOP, the contractor shall provide 24/7 access to a pharmacist by phone.  



Tracking and dispensing procedures shall be in the accordance with Federal and State law.  The Contractor shall not collect sales tax on prescriptions dispensed by the mail order pharmacy.



Dispensed ingredients shall be priced on the TED record at the burdened Unit of Measure Price from the Managed Care Pricing File (MCPF) provided by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). See Section C.7.11 for more information.  



Mail Order Pharmacy Accounts



For MOP prescription orders, the contractor shall allow beneficiaries to provide a credit card for the co-payment amount.  The contractor shall establish individual accounts for family members, and shall allow for more than one credit card to be on record for collection purposes.  The contractor shall ensure that if a beneficiary overpays a co-payment amount, the beneficiary is notified that the excess has been credited to the beneficiary’s account for future prescriptions, or the overpayment is refunded to the beneficiary along with the explanation of the refund, whichever the beneficiary prefers.  



As a result of its own business judgment and at its own risk, the contractor may choose to extend credit to beneficiaries so that when an insufficient co-payment is received, the contractor may fulfill the prescription order up to the amount of the contractor established credit limit and credit aging parameters.  As the contractor is not acting as an agent of the Government in extending credit to beneficiaries, none of the recoupment procedures set forth in this contract or the TRICARE manuals shall be available to the contractor to collect beneficiary co-payments.  Likewise, any uncollected debts from beneficiaries resulting from the extension of credit are not reimbursable under this contract.  If the contractor does not extend credit or the beneficiary has exceeded the contractor’s established credit parameters, the contractor shall return the prescription to the beneficiary and notify the beneficiary of the correct co-payment amount required



Mailing Prescriptions



MOP prescription orders shall only be mailed to beneficiaries living in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Guam; to beneficiaries with an Army Post Office (APO), Fleet Post Office (FPO), or U.S. Embassy address; and to troops in deployed theatres of operation. Beneficiaries in deployed theatres of operation will be identified by the Government.



MOP prescriptions shall be shipped or mailed postage paid to the beneficiary in a manner which provides, at a minimum, a delivery time equivalent to first class U.S. Mail. 



Upon request by the beneficiary, the contractor shall provide next day delivery services to beneficiaries residing in the continental United States (CONUS).  The contractor may charge the beneficiary for the additional shipping cost in accordance with the most favorable shipping rate available to the contractor.

The contractor shall be responsible for all medications dispensed by the contractor up to the point of delivery to the beneficiary or to the alternate delivery location designated by the beneficiary.  The contractor shall allow 12 days from the original ship date for the beneficiary to receive their order.  Beginning 12 days after the ship date, the contractor shall reship the order within 3 days of receiving notification from the beneficiary that their order has not been received.  A beneficiary shall have up to 45 days from the original ship date to report that an order was not received and request a replacement with no additional co-payment.  This shall be extended to 60 days for prescriptions sent using an APO, FPO or U.S. Embassy address. The contractor shall not receive an administrative fee or replenishment for replacement shipments.  



The contractor shall comply with U.S., Military and U.S. Embassy Postal Service regulations.



The contractor shall include a pre-addressed envelope with each order shipped so the beneficiary may order refills or new prescriptions.



Partial Shipments



When directed by the government, the contract will provide partial shipments of high cost medications if the days’ supply called for on the prescription exceeds 30 days.  The full co-payment will be collected on the first partial shipment.  Subsequent partial shipments will have no co-payment assessed until the full quantity of the prescription has been dispensed or until the prescription has expired.  The contractor shall document the receipt of the copay and all subsequent shipment covered by that co-payment.



The contractor shall follow guidelines established by P&T, provided at  when dispensing partial fills through the mail order pharmacy.



Compounded Medications



Before dispensing any compounded medication through the MOP, the contractor shall verify that all supplies and ingredients required to prepare the compound are available for replenishment from the National Prime Vendor (NPV), as described in C.7.11.  In the event that any required products are not available, the contractor shall return the prescription to the beneficiary. 



Error Reporting



The contractor shall provide a report on all defects and errors at the MOP.  For purposes of this report, the Government defines a medical error according to the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting & Prevention (NCC-MERP): “Any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient or consumer.“ Examples include, but are not limited to:

Lost or damaged prescriptions [discovered] upon receipt, resulting in delay in processing and/or increased difficulty in transcription; 

Prescriptions entered into the incorrect patient’s profile, transcribing the wrong drug or dose, or directions [sig], into the patient’s profiles;

Failing to correctly enter all elements of a prescription, e.g., refills, such that the patient may not correctly receive the correct duration of therapy; or events that may trigger an allergy or drug-drug interaction, dosed incorrectly, wrong quantity transcribed, etc;

Incorrect quantity dispensed, broken medications, label, bottle or packing defects, improper storage or shipping.  



Prescription Transfers from Retail



At the beneficiary’s request, the contractor shall contact the provider to obtain a new prescription to be filled by the MOP or the beneficiary’s designated MTF Pharmacy.   The contractor shall offer both points of service as an option to the beneficiary to transfer their medications. 



For each prescription transferred from a retail pharmacy to the MOP or MTF pharmacy, the contractor shall receive an incentive fee.  The contractor must have a record of the prescription being filled at retail within the prior 60 days and must have contacted the provider to obtain a new prescription for the mail order pharmacy or MTF pharmacy to be eligible for the incentive payment.  Upon request, the contractor shall provide documentation to the government that both of these criteria have been met.   100% of all transfers shall be completed within 21 days from beneficiary authorization.  



Mandatory Generic Program



The TRICARE pharmacy program requires mandatory generic substitution.  The contractor will use best commercial practices to maximize generic substitution, including attempts to convert Dispense as Written (DAW) prescriptions. Upon receipt of a DAW prescription for a brand name product for which a generic equivalent is available, the contractor shall contact the prescriber to change the prescription to a generic equivalent. If the prescriber refuses to switch, then the prescription shall be processed according to government-approved prior authorization criteria, as described in C.9.1. If the prior authorization is denied, the prescription shall be returned to the beneficiary. If the contractor cannot contact the prescriber, the contractor shall call the beneficiary, notify them that their prescription will be returned, and the reason why. For all denied mail order prescriptions, the contractor must also provide notification to the beneficiary in writing explaining why the order was denied and detailing the beneficiary's appeal rights. 



In instances when the Government has determined it to be benefical and provided direction, the contractor may dispense brand in lieu of generic without a prior authorization.



The contractor shall identify Brand over Generic prior authorizations at retail and mail in its reporting of Clinical Reviews.





MTF Prescriptions: Mail Fulfillment



The contractor shall provide a modified dispensing operation through the MOP in support of MTF pharmacies. The government will establish the list of drugs to be supported under this requirement.  MTF pharmacies will transmit eligible prescription orders to the contractor for dispensing and shipping.  Under this program, the contractor will dispense the requested prescription using the information provided on the request.  The contractor shall not perform checks for eligibility or ProDUR.  The contractor will not collect a copayment for these prescriptions. All prescription orders shall be shipped to the beneficiary within 7 days of receipt using the address provided on the request and an electronic response sent to the MTF with the shipment tracking information for the prescription. In the event that the contractor is unable to dispense the medication, the contractor shall return a message to the MTF stating that the prescription could not be filled with an explanation This notification shall be sent to the MTF as soon as the contractor is aware that they will not be able to fill the medication but no later than 7 days after receipt.  The MTF retains ownership of all prescriptions filled through this modified dispensing operation and will provide all customer service related to the prescription.  The contractor’s system shall identify all prescriptions it dispenses through its mail order facility that originated from an MTF and transmit that information to the data warehouse. 



All medications dispensed under this requirement shall identify the MTF as the dispensing pharmacy on the prescription label, subject to state board of pharmacy requirements, and shall provide the address and phone number of that MTF.   The contractor shall not provide customer support services to the beneficiary for MTF prescriptions fulfilled through the MOP.  The contractor shall not generate a TED for these prescriptions. 



The standard replenishment process, described in C.7.9 will be used for drugs dispensed under this requirement.  



The contractor shall develop a drug file based on the government’s drug list that will map to the MTF’s prescribed medication to determine the exact medication dispensed by the MOP.  The contractor shall provide ongoing support to the MTFs for this mapping file and all other aspects of this program, as described in C.10.2.  



Medications dispensed through this program shall be included in all applicable mail order pharmacy reporting, where they will be separately broken out and identified.   

Prescriptions dispensed shall meet the following standards: 

100% of MTF prescriptions fulfilled by the MOP shall be shipped or returned to the MTF within 7 calendar days of receipt, measured monthly. 

Prescriptions dispensed from the MOP shall be accurate 100% of the time, measured monthly.



Specialty Pharmacy Services



Specialty pharmaceuticals are high-cost injectable, infused, oral or inhaled drugs that are generally more complex to distribute, administer and monitor than traditional drugs. The contractor shall provide specialty pharmaceuticals through the mail order and retail pharmacy venues. The contractor shall operate programs to maximize the extent to which beneficiaries obtain specialty pharmaceuticals from mail order rather than from retail pharmacies.  



Recognizing that in the retail venue specialty or limited distribution drugs are frequently shipped to beneficiaries from centralized locations, the DoD  designates specialty pharmacies owned, affiliated, or contracted by the contractor as “DoD specialty mail order” outlets subject to federal ceiling pricing and mail order replenishment requirements outlined in Section C.7.9 of this contract offering. 



The contractor shall ensure that beneficiaries have access to pharmaceuticals that are subject to limited distribution channels established by the pharmaceutical manufacturer and/or the Food and Drug Administration.



The contractor shall provide a dedicated toll free number for beneficiaries and providers to call for assistance relating to specialty pharmaceuticals and services. Hours of operation shall be 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. (ET) at a minimum.  A Pharmacist shall be accessible 24 hours a day/7 days a week in support of the mail order pharmacy and clinical services program.



At the government’s direction, the contractor shall provide data to and accept data from the regional medical contractors (MCSCs) and the government.  The contractor shall also collaborate with the medical contractors and the government in evaluating clinical effectiveness of specific aspects of the pharmacy benefit, including but not limited to the specialty drug and home infusion therapy programs. 



Clinical Services Program



The contractor shall provide clinical services in conjunction with all pharmaceuticals designated on the DoD clinical services drug list and dispensed through the mail order pharmacy, including contractor-owned specialty pharmacies designated as DoD specialty mail order outlets.   Final decisions of the Director, TRICARE Management Activity regarding changes to the identification of pharmaceuticals subject to clinical services and change implementation dates are published in the quarterly DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutic Committee Minutes at .  

The contractor shall provide clinical support services to beneficiaries receiving designated medications through its mail order or specialty pharmacies.  These services shall include, but are not limited to: 



Optimizing therapeutic outcome by minimizing adverse clinical events, minimizing waste, and achieving a high level of beneficiary satisfaction.

Conducting patient centric adherence monitoring and member education programs: optimize medication adherence (education, reminders, side-effect management) for specialty drug products with poor adherence rates or significant risks when used inappropriately.

Provision of educational information and medication administration training through multiple mediums, such as verbal, written or on-line, to TRICARE beneficiaries receiving specialty drugs.

Providing plan-specific clinical and outcomes reporting, including rates of switching of specialty pharmaceutical prescriptions from retail to mail order.

Providing specialty drug market analytics, and developing pro-active cost and utilization management programs directed towards members and prescribers



All beneficiaries filling these medications through a DoD mail order pharmacy outlet are to be automatically enrolled to receive these clinical services.   On a quarterly basis, the contractor shall conduct a review for patients who have refused to participate in these clinical services.  These beneficiaries shall be un-enrolled from the program, after which time the contractor will only receive the standard mail dispensing fee for filling these prescriptions.  The contractor shall have a mechanism to track and record beneficiaries actively receiving clinical services and provide this information to the government upon request. 



Deployment Prescription Program



The contractor shall manage all aspects of the MOP registration and prescription process for deploying service members.  



For beneficiaries in deployed theaters of operation the contractor shall provide notification by email or telephone, based on beneficiary preference, of prescriptions received, placed in pended status, and the anticipated processing date for each.  



The contractor shall receive prescriptions via standard mail, fax, or secure server from any Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP) or Center (SRC) location or directly from deployment location.  Upon receipt of a prescription for a deployed service member, the contractor shall verify, adjudicate, and process the prescription in accordance with the procedures outlined in below. 



In support of the Deployment Prescription Program, the contractor shall establish communication and maintain a current point of contact at all SRP/SRC units.  The contractor shall educate the sites on the most common causes for delays in prescription processing and returned prescriptions and actively work with the sites to maximize the volume of clean prescriptions received and dispensed.  



Upon receipt, the contractor shall perform the following verification steps: 

Perform DEERS eligibility query.  If member shows ineligible, contractor shall contact deployed member to notify them to update DEER with active status. Activated National Guard and Reserve service members may have to submit orders to DEERS. 

Verify that registration is complete and legible.  If further information is required to process the prescription, the contractor shall contact SRP/SRC site directly within one business day.  

Enter all beneficiary registration and prescription information into contractor’s system and verify that the information provided is complete and correct.  The most common cases for delayed prescriptions are: 

Invalid/missing APO address 

Missing prescriber signature, illegible name, missing DEA, NPI, license, or SSN.  Note: All prescriptions for controlled medications must have the prescriber’s DEA number. 

Drug name/strength/form incorrect or missing

Directions are missing, written “as directed” or not consistent with the dosage form (i.e. medication is a patch but directions are “one po qd”.)  

Active duty member is showing as ineligible in DEERS. 

Prescription written for temperature sensitive medications.  This includes capsules being shipped during hotter months and similar medications not otherwise requiring refrigeration.  

Communicate with SRP POC to insure all prescriber credentials are received

Verify whether script is for immediate fill or pended status.  

Enter appropriate overrides to allow prescription to fill.  These overrides may include the following: 

Max days supply limit (up to 180 days supply)

Refill too soon

Medical necessity

Prior Authorization required

Excluded drug – When in receipt of a valid prescription for a deployed service member, the contractor shall process medications otherwise excluded from the TRICARE benefit at the retail and mail points of service. 

Quantity Limits

Maximum Cost



Where clarification is required to process the prescription, the contractor shall contact the prescriber within 1 working day to verify prescription. The contractor shall allow 10-14 days for the prescriber to respond.  If no response is received from the prescriber, the contractor shall contact the SRP/SRC for assistance in correcting the prescription.  After attempting appropriate follow-up, the contractor shall return any prescriptions that cannot be processed to SRP/SRC point of contact. 

When a delay is expected in entering the pended prescription and/or processing the immediate order, the contractor shall notify the service member within 1 business day. Notification shall occur by email or phone, based on the beneficiary’s preference.

The contractor shall notify both the prescriber and service member by email to confirm successfully processing and/or shipping of a prescription.



Pharmaceutical Agents



The contractor shall provide the initial inventory of pharmaceutical agents for the Mail Order Pharmacy (MOP) for dispensing to TRICARE beneficiaries.



In order for the Government to replenish pharmaceutical agents dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries, the contractor shall: (1) request replenishment in kind of the same pharmaceutical agents as dispensed; or (2) request replenishment by the therapeutically equivalent pharmaceutical agent.  The contractor shall request replenishment for pharmaceutical agents dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by using the Managed Care Pricing File (MCPF) to obtain pharmaceuticals from a contracted National Prime Vendor (NPV).  Under certain circumstances, it may be preferable to both the government and the contractor for the contractor to request settlement in place of replenishment, but this deviation shall occur only with prior government approval.  



The Government compiles the MCPF from Federal Supply Schedules (FSS), Distribution and Pricing Agreements (DAPA), joint Department of Defense/Department of Veterans Affairs (DoD/DVA) national contracts, DoD contracts, and Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA). This is currently compiled by the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support (DLA).



The contractor shall use the MCPF to identify, select, and price orders from the NPV for products in package sizes that are most economical to the Government.  If the contractor is using the NPV’s online ordering system, the contactor is required to select the most economical contracted product available in the online ordering system. 



Orders shall be rounded down to the nearest whole package size of product needed to replenish product dispensed through the MOP.



 The pharmaceuticals or products will be shipped by the NPV to the contractor’s MOP locations.



The contractor shall provide volume utilization data to the NPV for medications dispensed by the mail order pharmacy, to be used in determining the quantity stocked by the NPV.   This data shall be provided in a format mutually agreed upon by the contractor, the TPharm COR, and DLA.



At least twice a year, the contractor shall participate in a process to expend any credits that have accumulated with the NPV as a result of returns, pricing errors, and other adjustments.  This date and exact process for using the credit shall be mutually agreed-upon by DLA, the NPV, the Government and the contractor.  In the event of an unusually large credit, the Government may initiate an out-of-cycle request to perform the process. 



The contractor shall accommodate all special requirements in regards to handling,  processing or shipping medications as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or manufacturer for products dispensed through the MOP. 



Rebaseline and Continuous Monitoring



Prior to the beginning of the first option period, by a date mutually agreed upon during the post award meeting, and during each successive exercised option period within 60 days of Contracting Officer notification, the contractor will submit a baseline listing of multi-source generic or branded products by 11-digit National Drug Code (NDC) for Contracting Officer approval.



Each baseline listing will identify the therapeutically equivalent NDC that is the most economical to the Government.



Following the start of Option Period 1, the contractor shall continuously monitor on a weekly basis product availability and pricing of all products to provide recommendations to the Government for the most cost-effective agents to be dispensed through the MOP.   The contractor shall identify the recommended change by 11-digit NDC for Government approval and the anticipated annual savings to the Government based on current utilization trends. 



The contractor will provide a quarterly status report of the continuous monitoring effort. 

The Contracting Officer may direct the contractor to make additional changes due to: 1) significant changes in drug prices, 2) the Government’s award of a pharmaceutical procurement contract, or 3) other circumstances that necessitate a change.  



Authorization for switches must be obtained from the Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), or designated government authority in writing.



The contractor shall complete each NDC change not later than thirty calendar days after being notified by the Government.  The contractor shall attempt to deplete all current inventory received from the prime vendor prior to implementing the NDC change.  In situations where the prime vendor has supplies of government specific inventory, the contractor shall work with the prime vendor to deplete supplies prior to implementing the NDC change.  The contractor shall notify the government if it anticipates any reason why it will be unable to deplete this inventory.  



The contractor shall submit a written request for extension to the COR within ten days of receiving initial notification if the NDC change is expected to take longer than thirty calendar days. 



The request shall state the date the NDC change will be made and include the rationale for the extension. 



The contractor shall track and report volume of dispensed pharmaceutical agents and replenishment pharmaceutical agents ordered and received from the NPV, and provide auditable reconciliation reporting by 11-digit NDC number. The elements required for auditing will be specified by the Government.   In cases where therapeutic equivalent agents are used to replenish dispensed pharmaceutical agents, the contractor will maintain records which permit the therapeutic equivalent agents to be tracked by quantity and cost back to the original agents in the contractor’s inventory.  (See C.7.11). In the event that a dispensed NDC is not available for replenishment, the contractor will request replenishment with an equivalent substitute product with the same drug, dose, and dosage form.  The government considers a drug to be unreplenishable only when there is no longer a therapeutically equivalent product on the market; any other circumstances require independent review and approval by the government.  



The contractor shall not deviate from the procedures described above when ordering products from the NPV without prior written authorization from the Contracting Officer or COR.  Requests to do so shall include the 11-digit NDC number, nomenclature of the product(s), package size, anticipated purchase quantity, unit cost per package, and anticipated total cost of the order for both the requested product and the product it will replace.



The contractor will provide written notification to the Government within a reasonable time frame if issues arise concerning product availability where significant costs may be incurred by the government.   



In limited cases, the contractor may be required to order certain pharmaceutical agents and supplies through the NPV to be drop shipped directly from the manufacturer to the TPharm contractor.



The quantities ordered shall not exceed the amount to be dispensed.  



The contractor shall enter/acknowledge the item quantity received for all replenishment purchase orders placed with the Prime Vendor in a DoD directed database/system/or webpage within three (3) calendar days of the product being delivered to the contractor's facility.



The contractor, by performing the quantity receipt acknowledgement process, will not be responsible for the cost of the product received from the Government (currently handled by DLA) to the extent that receipts represent replenishment of authorized quantities dispensed at the MOP. 





Formulary & Copay

Uniform Formulary



The contractor shall comply with the provisions of the DoD Uniform Formulary and its co-payment structure.  Uniform Formulary changes are generally announced quarterly.  The contractor shall continually monitor and implement uniform formulary changes published at http://pec.ha.osd.mil/pt_minutes.php.  Additional information may be found at . 



TRICARE authorized vaccines administered by retail pharmacies in accordance with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) immunization protocols found at  governing their use, are covered under the Pharmacy Benefits Program. The list of TRICARE authorized vaccines are found at the current DoD Drug Formulary Search Tool is located at .  The contractor shall also monitor and adhere to any future change to the list if and when it occurs. 





Co-payment Collection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        



Co-payments shall be charged to beneficiaries in accordance with the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual, Chapter 2, Addendum B.  The contractor shall be responsible for collecting beneficiary co-payments when dispensing prescriptions through the mail order pharmacy, and ensuring that the appropriate co-payment is collected at retail pharmacies.  The contractor shall make changes to its systems to implement the pharmacy co-payment specified in the TRICARE Reimbursement Manual, Chapter 2, Addendum B within 14 calendar days of receiving notice from the Government that the co-payment dollar amount and/or percentage has changed.  Co-payments for prescriptions under special programs will be included in TRICARE Reimbursement Manual, Chapter 2.  Addendum B may vary from the normal three tier structure.  All co-payment changes will be effective for pharmaceuticals dispensed on and after the implementation date specified by the Government. 



Clinical Services

Clinical Reviews

 

The contractor shall perform clinical reviews for pharmaceuticals designated by the DoD P&T Committee as requiring prior authorization (PA) and/or medical necessity (MN), and based upon DoD P&T Committee established criteria. The P&T Committee will provide prior authorization and/or medical necessity criteria for these pharmaceuticals.  The contractor shall conduct clinical reviews using the approved criteria. 



A current listing of pharmaceuticals requiring prior authorization may be found at  and a current listing of pharmaceuticals requiring medical necessity may be found at 

.   When the P&T Committee designates new pharmaceuticals as requiring prior authorization or medical necessity, the contractor shall adopt those changes according the specified implementation date.  The contractor shall have a process for validating new clinical review requirements to ensure that claims adjudicate as intended by the government.  



The contractor shall use best commercial practices for prior authorization and medical necessity reviews so as to achieve TRICARE Pharmacy Program objective of minizing costs to the Government by maximizing the use of preferred drugs and minimizing the use of non-preferred or non-formulary drugs.  



The contractor shall check the patient’s profile to determine if a clinical review for prior authorization or medical necessity has been completed as a result of an MTF dispensing or for a mail order or retail dispensing.  The contractor shall not perform a clinical review if one has previously been completed.  If no PA or MN is on file and there is no prior record of an MTF dispensing of the medication, the contractor shall perform the determination and transmit the approval or denial of the PA or MN determination to PDTS.  Additionally, TED records will be submitted for all approved or denied clinical reviews performed, in accordance with the TRICARE Systems Manual.  If additional information is received for a denied PA or MN within 14 (fourteen) calendar days of the initial denial, the reconsideration shall be considered part of the initial review and no change shall be made to a previously submitted TED for the revised PA or MN. 



The contractor shall send a letter to the beneficiary and prescriber providing notification of decision.  For denied prior authorizations or  medical necessity determinations, the letter shall advise the beneficiary of their appeal rights. The initial notification shall contain sufficient information to enable the beneficiary or prescriber to understand the basis for the denial and shall state with specificity what services and supplies are being denied and for what reason (i.e., listing specific PA or MN criteria not met). The contractor shall utilize best commercial practices for communicating these denials to minimize beneficiary confusion. An appeal of the contractor’s initial determination and any further appeals shall be processed in accordance with the TRICARE Operations Manual, Chapter 12.



The contractor will also be responsible for 1) providing expertise and  recommendations for implementation of criteria prior to PA or MN implementation, based on best commercial practice; and  2)  maintenance of the criteria  over  time (i.e., making appropriate recommendations for changes to the criteria if new clinical information becomes available after the implementation period).  The contractor will make changes to implementation processes or criteria, as they relate to TRICARE patients, and provide those changes for Government review and approval.  The contractor will be responsible for developing the mechanism for reviews, subject to Government approval.



 The contractor shall perform prior authorization determinations regarding off-label use of pharmaceuticals in accordance with the TRICARE Policy Manual, Chapter 8, Section 9.1. 



The contractor shall have the ability to identify, in an automated and timely manner, patients with existing prior authorizations for specific medications at the request of the government.  The contractor shall have the further ability to remove or apply a specific prior authorization, or to extend or shorten its duration, for any identified patient or group of patients.



The contractor shall process clinical review requests and send beneficiary notification in a manner to meet the following minimum accuracy standards:



95% of all clinical reviews shall be completed and notification (mail language to physician) sent to the beneficiary within 5 calendar days of receipt of a properly completed request, measured monthly. 

100% of all clinical reviews shall be completed and notification sent to the beneficiary within 10 calendar of receipt of a properly completed request, measured monthly. 



Non-Federal Ceiling Pricing Medications at Retail



Retail claims for pharmaceutical agents and diabetic supplies will be limited by the Non-Federal Ceiling Price (Non-FCP) requirements at 10 USC 1074 g.(f). When specific drugs at retail are excluded due to non-compliance with the law, the contractor shall facilitate either a change in the beneficiary's current prescription to an approved pharmaceutical supply or the shift of their prescription to home delivery. Pharmaceuticals agents and diabetic supplies that are subject to Non- FCP at retail and their respective implementation dates are published at Cmte/default.htm.



For these Non-FCP medications, the contractor shall perform retail prior authorization tasks in accordance with TRICARE Policy Manual Chapter 8, Section 9 by:

Blocking an initial fill for a selected drug at retail if beneficiary has not received that drug during a 180 day look back period.

Blocking the refill of an active prescription for a selected drug at retail after a period of time to be specified by the Government.

Overriding at retail for a selected drug, if a prior authorization has been submitted and accepted. The PA criteria will be defined by the Government.



Clinical Reviews for Dispensing Brand Over Generic



The contractor shall perform prior authorizations using contractor-developed, Government-approved criteria to determine when there is a clinical justification to use a brand name drug in lieu of a generic equivalent. The contractor’s criteria and documentation of clinical basis for criteria will be made available to the Government, for initial approval, not less than 120 days prior to the start of the contract. Once initial criteria are approved, the contractor will make changes to the criteria, as they relate to TRICARE patients, only upon Government approval.



Administrative  and Automated Overrides



The contractor shall perform prior authorizations for exceptions to age limitations (e.g., pre-natal vitamins and tretinoins). Contractor approval of quantity limit overrides for vacations, deployments, or medication dosage changes do not require the same level of effort as other prior authorization determinations, and are not considered to be clinical reviews.  



Administrative Overrides for MTF Claims



MTF pharmacies perform their own clinical review and the government deems that the requirement for prior authorization for a drug has been satisfied if that drug has been dispensed at an MTF pharmacy.   Upon receiving a claim for a designated drug from on MTF, the contractor shall generate a prior authorization including: 

Identification of Beneficiary 

Identification of Drug at the desired level of granularity 

Effective and Termination Dates of the PA 



The resulting auto-generated prior authorization for an MTF dispensing shall be applicable to the dispensing of the medication at other points of service.  The generated PA shall be transmitted to the PDTS contractor in a daily batch file.



Automated Reviews, e.g., Step Therapy



The contractor shall provide Step Therapy services for pharmaceuticals and drug classes designated by the DoD P&T Committee. Step Therapy is a type of prior authorization that is intended to channel patients to preferred agents that provide the most cost-effective therapy and the least risk to patients. The contractor shall perform the Step Therapy reviews electronically via automated medication profile review in real-time at the point of service. When a prescription for a trigger drug is presented, the automated profile review will look back a minimum of 180 days, and up to 360 days for qualifying drugs. Contractor’s lookback methodology shall have technical capabilities to be able to address a variety of potentially complex step edits, such as multiple steps.



Safety Enhancement for Step Therapy



The contractor will promote patient safety when the step therapy edit results in a prescription claim rejection. 



At a minimum, the contractor shall rapidly ensure that the beneficiary and prescriber understand why a rejection has occurred and the available options and alternatives drugs, as applicable.  The contractor shall also perform outreach to patients who encounter a rejection and subsequently do not fill a prescription for the medication or for a suitable alternative following the initial rejection. The contractor shall provide outreach to all such patients for Step Therapy for drugs or classes designated by the P&T Committee.  



Utilization Management



The Utilization Management Program is a coordinated effort between pharmacy and medical venues to identify candidates who exhibit possible unsafe controlled medication usage and to restrict specific individuals to appropriate levels of utilization for their medical situation.  Upon approval from the Government, the contractor shall enter restrictions for a beneficiary. The contractor shall also apply restrictions for beneficiaries at their own request, such as in cases of identity theft.  Beneficiaries with restrictions entered at their own request are able to dis-enroll at any time.   



The provider has the option to: 



1.	Restrict the beneficiary to all drugs to a specific pharmacy(s) and/or provider(s); 

2.	Restrict the beneficiary to specific controlled medications and/or specific non-control medications to a specific provider(s);  

3.	Limit Items to specific MTF pharmacy(s) by excluding controlled medications or specific non-controlled medications from retail and mail order; or

|1. Each applicable "Guaranteed Average Price Adjustment Percentage" and "Guaranteed Average                                        |
|Dispensing Fee" in this table will be used to calculate incentives as described in Section H.1.2.                                  |

Subject to paragraph H.1.3. below, the Contractor may earn an incentive fee if the total actual retail network reimbursement cost in a contract
option period is less than the "Total Expected Government Cost for Reimbursement of Retail Network Pharmacy Costs" that would have resulted from
applying the Guaranteed Average Price Adjustment Percentage and the Guaranteed Average Dispensing Fee per prescription to the prescriptions
filled in the retail network during the contract option period. The Total Expected Government Cost for Reimbursement of Retail Network Pharmacy
Costs will be calculated by first applying the Wholesale Average Price (WAC) price published by First DataBank (FDB) that is in effect at the
time the prescription transaction is processed to completion and accepted by TEDS, then adjusting the WAC price by applying the applicable
"Guaranteed Average Price Adjustment Percentage" at table H-1, and finally, adding the applicable "Guaranteed Average Dispensing Fee" specified
in Table H-1 for each retail network prescription processed during the period. Prescriptions for which no WAC price published by First DataBank
(FDB) is available at the time the prescription transaction is processed to completion and accepted by TEDS will be calculated using the
discount specified in Table H-1 off of Acquisition Wholesale Price (AWP) rates published by Medispan.

The incentive will equal 10% of the difference between the total actual retail network reimbursement cost reported in TEDS and the Total
Expected Government Cost for Reimbursement of Retail Network Pharmacy Costs. For example, if in any option period the Contractor's Guaranteed
Average Price Adjustment Percentage and the Guaranteed Average Dispensing Fee per prescription result in a Total Expected Government Cost for
Reimbursement of Retail Network Pharmacy Costs of $5 billion, and the actual cost to the Government was $4.95 billion, the Contractor would be
eligible for an incentive fee of $5 million (10% of the savings of$50 million) for that option period.   The amount of the incentive that the
Contractor may earn is not limited.

The Government will assess a negative incentive if the total actual retail network reimbursement cost in a contract option period exceeds the
Total Expected Government Cost for Reimbursement of Retail Network Pharmacy Costs that would have resulted from applying the Guaranteed Average
Price Adjustment Percentage and the Guaranteed Average Dispensing Fee per prescription to the prescription transaction processed to completion
during the contract option period. The difference between the actual costs and the Total Expected Government Cost for Reimbursement of Retail
Network Pharmacy Costs will be a negative incentive assessed for the option period.

For example, if in any option period the Contractor's Guaranteed Average Price Adjustment Percentage and the Guaranteed Average Dispensing Fee
per prescription result in a Total Expected Government Cost for Reimbursement of Retail Network Pharmacy Costs of $5 billion, and the actual
cost to the Government was $5.01 billion, the Contractor would be assessed a negative incentive amount of $10 million.

To earn the incentive fee referenced in paragraph H.1.1 above, the Contractor must meet or exceed all retail network access standards during a
minimum of eleven months in each option period. Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service, and Indian Health Service pharmacies will not be
included in the retail network access calculations.

Coordination of benefits claims, DVA claims, Medicaid claims, Public Health Service claims, Indian Health Service claims, non-network claims,
vaccines administered by retail network pharmacies, and prescriptions for supplies and compounded medications will not be included in the
calculation for the incentive fee or negative incentive assessment.


The Government's Pharmacy Data Transaction Service (PDTS) will accumulate reimbursement data from all retail network pharmacy transactions. PDTS
will be the sole data source for calculating the total actual retail network reimbursement cost, calculating the Total Expected Government Cost
for Reimbursement of Retail Network Pharmacy Costs, and calculating the amounts of any incentive fee or any negative incentive assessment.  The
Government will measure and calculate the incentive amount after each option period and will notify the Contractor of the results.  If the
Contractor earns an incentive fee, the Contracting Officer will provide invoice and payment instructions upon verification sufficient funding is
obligated on the Retail Network Cost Control Incentive line item in Section B.  If a negative incentive is assessed, the Contractor shall follow
the instructions of the Contracting Officer within 30 days.


 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

INCENTIVE FOR SAVINGS ON HIGH COST MEDICATIONS (CLINS ________)

For high cost medications designated by the Government for the purpose of this incentive, the Contractor will  receive an incentive fee equal to
10% of the cost savings achieved when the Contractor influences and facilitates or otherwise initiates action that results in a beneficiary’s
transfer of their prescription from a retail network pharmacy to the mail order pharmacy.  To be eligible for this incentive, the Contractor
must demonstrate that a retail prescription was filled within the past 120 days and document how the Contractor assisted the beneficiary in
moving the medication to the mail order pharmacy.  Qualifying initiatives and methods of assistance in moving prescriptions to mail order will
be solely determined by the Government based on the level the Contractor demonstrates it influenced the transfer to mail order. The amount of
the incentive will be based on the actual ingredient cost of the medication for the most recent claim processed for that beneficiary at the
retail network pharmacy and the ingredient cost of the medication for the first mail order fulfilled for that beneficiary at the mail pharmacy.
  The cost per 1 day supply at each point of service will then be determined and the incentive amount calculated by the Contractor based on the
day supply dispensed at the mail pharmacy.

For example, if the retail fill has an ingredient cost of $1,200 for a 30 day supply, the daily cost of the medication would be $1200/30 = $40.
If the medication was dispensed at mail with an ingredient cost of $2000 for a 90 supply, the daily cost at retail would be used to calculate
the cost of the same 90-day supply at retail, $40 x 90 = $3600.  The cost savings for the medication at mail would be $3600-$2000 = $1600The
Contractor’s incentive fee would equal 1600 x 10% = $160.  The Contractor will earn an incentive fee one time based on the savings between the
most recent prescription filled at retail and the first fill at mail order.  The Contractor will not receive an incentive fee for subsequent
refills at mail order for the same prescription and beneficiary.

The Contractor is not eligible to receive the standard mail transfer incentive fee described under H.2.2 for medications designated as a high
cost medication for the purpose of this incentive.

The list of high cost medications, for the purpose of this incentive, is expected to change from time to time at the discretion of the
Government.  The retail ingredient cost of the medication will be as submitted by the retail pharmacy.  The mail order ingredient cost to the
Government is based on the Managed Care Pricing File.   All calculations will be based on the Contractor’s claims data to PDTS. The Contractor
shall submit the Contractor’s calculation of the incentive amount with supporting data, and its documented demonstration of the Contractor’s
actions resulting in transfers from retail to mail order four times per option period for the preceding three months.  Based on the Contractor’s
submittal, the Government may verify ingredient costs and make the final determination of the incentive fee amount earned by the Contractor
considering the Contractor’s documentation.  The incentive fee amount is final upon notification by the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting
Officer will provide invoice and payment instructions upon verification sufficient funding is obligated on the applicable High Cost Medication
Incentive line item.  The Government‘s assessment of the Contractor’s submittal will be shared with the Contractor upon request. The Government
reserves the right to review, audit, or validate the Contractor’s system, written processes, and adherence to those processes at any time in
order to validate or determine the acceptability of the Contractor’s measurement and calculations.


Incentive for Transfers to Mail Order or MTF Pharmacies (CLINS ______)


Separate from the transaction service for transferring retail prescriptions to mail order or MTF pharmacies specified in C.7.6, the Contractor
will receive an incentive fee for identifying new prescriptions which are successfully transferred from a retail pharmacy to the mail order
pharmacy, or the beneficiary’s designated MTF Pharmacy.  The Contractor shall receive this incentive fee one time per beneficiary/drug. The
Contractor must have a record of the prescription being filled at retail within the prior 60 days, and must have contacted the provider to
obtain a new prescription to be eligible for the incentive fee.  Upon request, the Contractor shall provide documentation to the Government that
both of these criteria have been met.  Also, the transfer shall be completed within 21 calendar days from beneficiary authorization to be
eligible for the incentive fee.

This incentive shall be assessed subsequent to each contract quarter based on the Contractor’s report and verifying the eligibility requirements
for an incentive fee have been achieved.  The Contracting Officer will provide invoice and payment instructions upon verification sufficient
funding is obligated on the applicable Retail Prescription Transfer line item in Section B.


PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES

The performance guarantees described in this Section is the Contractor’s guarantee that the Contractor’s performance will not be less than the
performance standards described below. Each standard is guaranteed, measured, and assessed separately from contract standards specified in
Section C and the referenced TRICARE Manuals. The rights of the Government and remedies described in the Performance Guarantee Section are in
addition to all other rights and remedies of the Government. The Government further reserves the rights and remedies set forth in the Inspection
of Services clause (FAR 52.246-4, 52.246-5) and the Default clause (FAR 52.249-8, 52.249-6).

For each occurrence the Contractor fails to meet each guaranteed standard, the Government will withhold from the Contractor the amount listed in
the schedule below. Performance guarantee withholds will continue until the Contractor's performance improves to meet or exceed the standard.
Performance will be measured as specified below. The Contractor will be notified of withholds accumulated and assessed subsequent to each
contract quarter. For the purposes of this Section H.3, the term "performance standard" is defined as the  standard specified in this Section
H.3.

If it is determined that the performance standard was not met, then the performance guarantee withhold will be applied against the actual level
of performance. Each standard will be guaranteed, measured, and assessed the applicable withhold determined separately, and in addition to,
other standards.

For administrative purposes, the Contractor will be notified of performance guarantee withholds on a quarterly basis via a unilateral
modification in accordance with FAR 43.103(b)(3) with this section as the cited authority for the modification. Unless arrangements are made
otherwise, withholds will be made from the next available contract payment under any line item at discretion of the Government. Total
Performance Guarantees assessed under H.3.2 through H.3.8 for any Option Period shall not exceed $2,000,000.

Standard:  Measured on a monthly basis, all Beneficiary Services calls received shall be transferred to a Beneficiary Service Representative
with an Average Speed of Answer (ASA) of not more than 30 seconds after the caller has selected the option to speak to a BSR.

Withhold: $100,000 each full calendar month the standard is not met.

Measurement: Calendar month.  Contractor report.


Correspondence Processing

Standard:  Measured on a monthly basis, not less than 95% of priority correspondence will be processed to competition within 10 calendar days.
Priority correspondence is defined in TOM Chapter 23, Section 4, paragraph 1.1.

Withhold: $100,000 each full calendar month the standard is not met.

Measurement: Calendar month.  Contractor report.


TED Edit Accuracy (TOM Chapter 1)

Standard: Measured on a monthly basis, the accuracy rate for TED edits shall be not less than 95 % after six months of performance during the
first option period and 99 % after nine months and thereafter during the entire term of the contract.

Withhold: If the Contractor fails to meet the standard and falls below the standard, a performance guarantee amount of $1.00 for each TED record
not meeting the standard will be withheld. For example, if only 93.3% of all TEDs pass edits for each of months seven, eight, and nine, then a
performance guarantee amount will be applied to 1.7% of all TEDs submitted during the period (1.7% equals the difference between the
Contractor's actual performance and the standard in this example). If 1.7% equates to 153,000 TED records, the performance guarantee withhold
amount will be $153,000.00 (i.e., 153,000 X times $1.00).

Method: The number of TEDs failing to meet the standard will be determined each calendar month by the Government based on the TMA TED database.


REQUIREMENTS FOR MINIMUM LEVEL OF ENHANCED SAFEGUARDING FOR UNCLASSIFIED DOD INFORMATION

The Contractor shall implement and maintain information security in its project, enterprise, or company-wide unclassified information technology
system(s) in accordance with the requirements set forth in DOD Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-027, Security of Unclassified DoD Information
