SECTION C – DESCRIPTIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS

                                                                STATEMENT OF WORK

1.0   INTRODUCTION:

    The purpose of this solicitation is to acquire a contract providing the hardware and software products, their integration into the OWCP-
    DITMS environment, and deployment services necessary to implement the requirements provided in this document.

    Offeror shall develop a comprehensive and seamlessly integrated Unified Messaging system that would provide automated call distribution
    (ACD) and integrated voice response (IVR) technology to route, track, and monitor calls for Department of Labor’s (DOL) Regional, District,
    Area, and Field Offices across the United States. The system shall also collect and store call statistics and provide the ability to monitor
    (“listen in”) calls to gauge the accuracy and quality of information provided by DOL staff to customers contacting these offices.

    The proposed system shall be developed and maintained within the existing Division of Information Technology Management and Services (DITMS)
    Processing Centers and operate a non-proprietary platform: MS Windows, UNIX, and/or Linux based. It will support up to 1,600 users that may
    be logged on at any given time. The proposal must encompass a blended solution that can accommodate both Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
    and Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) configurations.  System testing and system maintenance shall be performed on site; some tasks
    related to system development may be completed on the contractor’s site. Offeror shall provide cost estimates for performing all development
    tasks at an off site location. Offeror must also address how off site development work would be effectively executed and managed.

    The proposed solution will provide DOL with comprehensive call management and customer service through a centralized IVR system. The initial
    software solution must provide: a maintainable replacement for the current District Office call routing functions, enhanced caller access to
    claim information to improve customer service and CE productivity, automatic generation of a CA-110 for every call to improve consistency
    and reporting, “screen pops” for CA-110 information to increase call handling efficiency and customer service, and comprehensive and
    consistent reporting of call related activity across all supported Regional, District, Area, and Field Offices.

    Offeror shall interact with DITMS and other DOL entities to ensure that system design, user accreditation, disaster and contingency
    planning, risk assessment, security protocol, systems deployment, maintenance schedules, and other related matters are aligned with the
    existing DOL IT policies and architecture. Gathering of user requirements, software development, unit and user testing, hardware
    configuration, database design, quality controls, and change control processes shall follow DOL’s SDLC processes.

    All contractor staff working on the contract on site are required to adhere to all DOL IT policies and will successfully complete the
    Computer Security Awareness training. Offeror shall also ensure that the Government, when necessary, will have access to Contractor and
    Subcontractor facilities, systems/networks operated on behalf of DOL, documentation, databases and personnel to perform IT inspections (to
    include vulnerability scanning), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to DOL data. Offeror shall follow an issue
    resolution process for any identified vulnerability or issue identified throughout Certification and Accreditation (C&A). Issue resolution
    provides an audit trail, accelerates the C&A and documents management accountability as outlined in NIST SP 800-37, “Guide for the
    Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems.”



      2.0   Purpose / Background


    WHD and DFEC

    The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) operates and maintains 200+ locations across the U.S., which includes Puerto Rico, Guam and Saipan. The
    200+ locations consist of five (5) Regional Offices, forty eight (48) District Offices, one hundred and seventy one plus (171+) Area, Field,
    and MSPA Farm Labor Contractor Offices.

    Current infrastructure for both DFEC and WHD includes:

 • Ninety-six (96) of the larger offices (12 of DFEC, 76 of WHD, 5 Regional Offices, and 3 MSPA Farm Labor) are  utilizing  PBXs  with  a  public
   published phone number. Several are an ESA-Managed switch (PBX) while others are utilizing an  OASAM-Managed  switch.  These  offices  provide
   dedicated personnel, including claims examiners (DFEC) and investigators (WHD) to answer customer inquiries. All  offices  incorporate  voice-
   mail capability but the mailbox sizes vary and are unknown.

 • The smaller Field Offices are utilizing POTS (plan old telephone system) analog lines and are staffed with investigators only.  These  offices
   will be treated as remote offices or extensions off their associated District or Area Office. Field Offices also have voice-mail  options  and
   the voice-mail option may be provided by the phone carrier or an external voice-mail machine. The individual office will have to be  contacted
   in order to verify.

 • None of the offices (National, Regional, District, Area, and Field) collect data for historical  reporting  purposes  with  the  exception  of
   limited call volumes on the larger systems utilizing a PBX. Note: data collected in the larger offices is limited to short  reporting  periods
   and currently unavailable historically.

 • The Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) / Division of Federal Employees’ Compensation (DFEC) operates and  maintains  twelve  (12)
   District Offices throughout the continental United States and one Specialist Office within Washington, DC. Every day, these  District  Offices
   handle a large number of calls regarding case-related matters or requesting compensations claims status, instruction and  general  information
   on the Federal Employees’ Compensation Act. Callers include federal employees, medical service providers, pharmacists,  legal  representatives
   and other claimant advocates, as well as congressional offices calling on behalf of their constituents.


3.0   Project Objectives

    Scope: To provide the means to improve customer service at many of the DOL offices across the United States with a state-of-the-art Computer
    Telephony Integrated (CTI / IVR) system capable of routing, tracking, monitoring, and recording customer calls. The scope of the project is
    to develop, implement, and maintain a complete IVR system that will encompass the above mentioned Regional, District, Area, and Field
    Offices within DOL. The system will include the ability to receive and route calls to an appropriate office, record customer/caller
    information (time of call, length of call, call waiting, etc.), provide supervisory and quality assurance monitoring (for quality and
    training purposes), real-time and historical reporting, and standardized Voice-mail. E-mail, and Fax capability. The scope of this project
    also includes the ability to capture customer information via the IVR (i.e. ANI, DNIS, claimant numbers, zip codes, etc.), provide this
    information to examiners and investigators, and provide customers with claimant and case status information.

    Objective: To obtain a solution that will include automated call distribution (ACD) ability to route calls to an appropriate office, record
    caller information (time of call, length of call, call waiting, etc.), supervisory and quality assurance monitoring (for quality and
    training purposes), real-time and historical reporting, and standardized Voice-mail, E-mail, and Fax. The solution shall include the
    development of an interface to the Information Federal Employment Compensation System (iFECS) database with the ability to upload collected
    IVR data and retrieval of claimant information.  The solution shall provide an API interface that supports COM, J2EE, and .NET that will
    give the ability to present collected IVR data and iFECS retrieved data to DFEC examiners in real-time formatted as a CA-110 ‘screen-pop’
    (refer to figure 4-3).

    The overall objective is to obtain an IVR system the meets and/or exceeds the project requirements as specified in the following Section 4 –
    Tasks / Requirements. The IVR system must work with the existing phone systems installed in each of the offices (refer to figure 4-2 for the
    standard office configuration).

    The solution shall include a training program that provides comprehensive instructions on use of the system, operating and administrating
    the system, and maintaining the system. The solution will include a Training Plan, training materials, and formal instruction. Formal
    instruction shall consist of traditional classroom sessions and/or web-based self-paced training courses.

    Schedule: The project will proceed in three (3) phases to ensure a smooth transition and minimize the implementation risk.  Note: Phase 2
    and 3, the Central Processing Center 2 and respective offices can be completed simultaneously (Phase 3 commencing upon completion of Central
    Processing Center 1) while Phase 2 will be completed consecutively following Phase 1.

    The three main phases planned are:

               • Phase 1:    Central Processing Center 1 – Development and implementation of primary centralized IVR system in Processing  Center
                 1 and development of the DFEC CA-110 screen pop.  The centralized IVR system will be initially configured to  provide  the  same
                 ACD and IVR functions available for the selected sites (business hours, current telephone numbers, etc.) utilizing the  existing
                 local phone services.

               • Phase 2:    Central Processing Center 2 – Implementation of secondary centralized IVR system in Processing Center 2.  For  DFEC,
                 phase 2 will include incorporating the central 800 number into  the  main  IVR  application  and  expanded  IVR  capability  for
                 providing customers with claim status information and improved self-service functions.

               • Phase 3:    Nationwide Deployment (deploys the completed  IVR  system  to  all  office  sites).  Will  include  agent/supervisor
                 training.

ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2   EVALUATION-- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:


  (1) Technical
  (2) Past Performance
  (3) Price


Basis for Award:  Technical is slightly more important than Past Performance and, Past Performance is slightly more important than Price.
However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. The Government reserves the right to award to
other than the lowest priced offeror if other offerors have a higher technical score and/or higher past performance rating. The non-Price
factors when combined are significantly more important than Factor III, Price. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made
to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest
overall price to the Government.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly
superior technical features.

  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option price is significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The total price offered (base period, option period(s), will be used as the overall
evaluated price.


  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

  (d) The Government will award a single Time and Material contract from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to
the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the
Government, with appropriate consideration given to the three evaluation factors:  {Technical, Past Performance, and Price}. All factors under
Volume I, Technical are of equal importance.


   (e) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer
should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions
if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the
public interest and/or waive(s) informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

  (f) Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:  The Government may reject any proposal  that  is  evaluated  to  be  unrealistic  in  terms  of  program
commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government  estimates,  such  that
the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk(s) of the program.

    (g) Correction Potential of Proposals:  The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the “correction potential” of any
deficiency or uncertainty.  The judgment of such “correction potential” is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an
Offeror’s proposal not meeting the Government’s requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be removed from further
consideration.

      (h) Pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated
proposals, unless the range is further reduced for reasons of efficiency.  Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f) (4), the Contracting Officer may limit
the number of proposals in the competitive range to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
Offerors are required to submit a technical, past performance and price proposals to be evaluated against the evaluation factors.  To determine
which firm represents the best value, the offers will be evaluated as outlined below.

FACTOR I -TECHNICAL:

      SubFactor 1- UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT – The Government will evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the work to be performed in
accordance with the SOW.  The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in this solicitation and
the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated.

      SubFactor 2- PERSONNEL - The Government will evaluate the experience and qualifications of all contractor personnel, to include resumes for
personnel and also provide a matrix to include the background/experience of the company’s proposed personnel mapped to the appropriate SOW
tasking that supports the proposed labor category and level.


      SubFactor 3 – CORPORATE EXPERIENCE - The Government will evaluate the offeror’s experience with work of a similar nature, scope,
complexity, and difficulty to that which will be performed under the prospective contract contemplated by this solicitation.


      SubFactor 4 – START-UP/PHASE-OUT/STAFFING PLAN - The Government will evaluate  the Start-Up Plan which should contain a  reasonable,
effective and realistic approach to quality control for assuming full contractual responsibility without disruption or degradation of
performance.  The plan shall identify risk, propose appropriate mitigation strategies, proposes a realistic, achievable and affordable start-up
schedule and staffing plan.  The plan shall ensure sufficient resources are on hand and available to begin work under this requirement.  It
shall include a statement that the personnel proposed are available, trained, and qualified to perform the work under this effort.  In addition
the government will evaluate the Phase-Out Plan submitted by the offeror based on how it demonstrates the offeror’s ability to enable a smooth
transition to replacement services when the contract period of performance ends.  The plan shall provide phase-in support for up to 90 days to
the selected contractor if the incumbent contractor is not selected herein. Contractors are required to submit their Start-Up/Phase-Out/Staffing
plan with their proposal or their proposal will be considered not acceptable.


      SubFactor 5:  QUALITY CONTROL PLAN - The Government will evaluate how the offeror intends to monitor, inspect, and correct deficiencies for
the requirements of the SOW.  The Government shall incorporate the QCP in the contract that will result from this solicitation.  The QCP will no
longer be considered proprietary and will be considered releasable under FOIA.

FACTOR II - PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate past performance of three contracts for current relevancy (contracts performed within
the past 3 years) based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity of work in the SOW.
Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources
other than those identified by the offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value
decision.  The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into
with Government agencies or private sectors.  For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account
information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will
perform key aspects of the requirement.  The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance
Questionnaire, Attachment 2.  Offeror shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so
the form can be completed and submitted directly to the Government.

FACTOR III - PRICE: Price will not be rated, as are Volumes 1 and 2, it will be evaluated in terms of completeness, balanced pricing and
reasonableness. After an evaluation of Volumes 1 and 2 has been completed and rankings have been established, the price to the Government will
be compared against these rankings to determine the combination most advantageous to the Government. Price will become significantly more
important as technical ratings approach equality.

Price reasonableness will be conducted for all Offerors. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a
prudent person would pay when consideration is given to market prices. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price
competition, but may also be determined through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. The Government may evaluate offers for
award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all option periods to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced.

Duration of Business Arrangement: The maximum period of performance of this contract will be two years (one twelve month base period with one 12-
month option period). This contract is not considered to be for advisory or assistance services in accordance with FAR Part 37.2.

of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.,

(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1)

Government Contracts paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license
agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard
Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.

(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance
and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting
from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the
Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in
the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this
contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract),
or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-
name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written
notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in
writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification
sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the
Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph
of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR
database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov
or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

52.232-7 PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-and-MATERIALS and LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS (FEB 2007)


  The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized
representative:
  (a) Hourly rate.
    (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor
category specified in the contract that are—
      (i) Performed by the Contractor;
      (ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or
      (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control.
    (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor hours
performed.
    (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.
Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is
performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.

    (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall
be payable on a prorated basis.
    (5) Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting
Officer or authorized representative. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly
rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by—
      (i) Individual daily job timekeeping records;
      (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or
      (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.
    (6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject to
the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative.
    (7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the
Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to
protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this
clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor
executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause.
    (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the
Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to
the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.
  (b) Materials.
    (1) or the purposes of this clause—
      (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.
      (ii) Materials means—
        (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common
control;
        (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract;
        (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer
usage charges, etc.); and
        (D) Applicable indirect costs.
    (2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such
materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the—
      (i) Quantities being acquired; and
      (ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.
    (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials
provided the Contractor—
      (i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or
      (ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such
payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.
    (4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine
allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract.

    (5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are—
      (i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate;
      (ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and
      (iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates.
    (6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall—
      (i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and
      (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take
advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit
to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the
Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the
benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government.
    (7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials.
  (c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such
consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the
Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at
the sole discretion of the Government.
  (d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price
set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations
under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material
costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued,
will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of
the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this
contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater
or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price
for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has
reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price,
the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the
contract.
  (e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and
the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and
until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised
ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in
the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the
increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling
price.
  (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting
documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the
Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the “completion voucher” and supporting
documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents
and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and
supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract,
but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.
  (g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at
the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under
this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:
    (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.
    (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
    (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.
  (h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services.
    (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are not
subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.
    (2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the _________ [Contracting Officer insert day as
prescribed by agency head; if not prescribed, insert “30th”] day after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request. In the
event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of
the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due date.
  (i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will
make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)


THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

PART II.   EVALUATION (TO BE COMPLETED BY POINT OF CONTACT – RESPONDENT)

For each performance element identified below, references should evaluate performance of the firm or individual identified  in  Part  1  of  this
form.  Where the reference lacks sufficient information to provide an evaluation for a particular performance  element,  this  should  be  noted.
Where any deficiency or unfavorable information is identified, the reference should identify any mitigating factors that may weigh in  favor  for
the person/firm on whose behalf the reference is provided (i.e., problems due to causes outside the contractor’s control).  An individual  within
your organization that is knowledgeable of the contractor’s day-to-day operations and overall performance  should  complete  this  questionnaire.
However, that individual is encouraged to supplement their own knowledge of the contractor’s performance  with  the  judgment  of  others  within
their organization, as applicable.

The following chart depicts the ratings that are to be used to evaluate the contractor’s performance:

subcontractor past performance information to the prime during exchanges.  In an effort to assist the Government in assessing your past
performance relevancy and confidence, we request that the following consent form be completed by the major subcontractors identified in your
proposal.  The completed consent forms should be submitted as part of your Past Performance Volume.

                                                                   ATTACHMENT 5

DOL Policy for PIV Card Issuance for New Federal Employees and Contractors (HR/SC 10/20/05)
                                      http://www.labornet.dol.gov/html/DOL-Policy-for-PIV-Card-Issuance.htm

A.        Purpose

Each Federal agency is required to develop a program to ensure that all employees and contractor employees who require access to DOL facilities
and information systems are issued Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards that satisfy the standard issued by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Commerce.  These instructions describe the Department’s process for implementation of Part I (PIV-
I) of the NIST standard for new Federal employees and contractor employees.
 
B.        Background

1. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, dated
August 27, 2004.  This document establishes the requirement for the development and agency implementation of a mandatory, government-wide
standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal employees and contractors.

2.  Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 201, Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,
published by NIST, dated February 25, 2005.  This document describes the standard for identification credentials issued by Federal agencies to
Federal employees and contractors under HSPD-12.  The PIV standard consists of two parts:  PIV-I describes the minimum requirements for a
Federal agency identification system that meets the control and security objectives of HSPD-12, including the personal identity proofing,
registration, and issuance.  PIV-II provides detailed technical specifications of components and processes required for interoperability of PIV
cards with the personal authentication, access control, and PIV card management systems across the Federal government.

3.  Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-05-24, Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12 – Policy for a
Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, dated August 5, 2005.  This document provides guidance to Federal agencies
on the implementation of HSPD-12 using the FIPS 201 standard.

C.    Implementation Schedule

This process applies to all new Federal employees and contractors who begin work with the Department on or after October 27, 2005.  DOL will
issue guidance regarding current Federal employees and contractors at a future date.

D.        Definitions

Applicant: An individual for whom a PIV card is being requested.

Contractor Employee: An individual under contract to the Department who requires routine access to Federally controlled facilities and/or
Federally controlled information systems and to whom the Department would issue an identity card, consistent with its existing security
policies.  Does not apply to individuals under contract to a department or agency, requiring only intermittent access to federally controlled
facilities.

Federal Employee: A Federal employee working for the Department who requires routine access to Federally controlled facilities and/or Federally
controlled information systems and to whom the Department would issue agency identity credentials, consistent with its existing security
policies.  This also includes employees from non-Federal organizations who are working for the Department under the Intergovernmental Personnel
Act.
 
Federally Controlled Facilities: These include the following:
Federally-owned buildings or leased space, whether for single or multi-tenant occupancy, and its grounds and approaches, all or any portion of
which is under the jurisdiction, custody or control of the Department.
Federally controlled commercial space shared with non-government tenants. For example, if the Department leased the 10th floor of a commercial
building, only the 10th floor would be a federally controlled facility.
Government-owned contractor-operated facilities.
Facilities under a management and operating contract, such as for the operation, maintenance, or support of a Government-owned or-controlled
research, development, special production, or testing establishment.

Federally Controlled Information Systems: These include the following:
Information technology systems (or information systems), as defined by the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. §
3502(8)).
Information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other
      organization on behalf of an agency (44 U.S.C. § 3544(a) (1) (A)).
Applicability for access to Federal systems from a non-Federally controlled facility (e.g., a
researcher up-loading data through a secure website or a contractor accessing a government
system from their own facility) should be based on the risk determination required by
existing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance.
Note: Any identification associated with national security systems as defined by the Federal
Information Security Management Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. § 3542(2) (A)) is excluded.
Issuer: This is the individual (s) who adds the applicant’s information into the DOL ID database and/or physically produces and issues the PIV
Card.  The Issuer may revoke the PIV card if requested by the Registrar due to unsatisfactory background investigation.

Others: Guest researchers, volunteers, and occasional visitors to facilities to whom the Department may issue a temporary identification.

Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Card: Each DOL PIV card is printed on a color-coded 2 ½ x 3 ½ white polyvinyl chloride (PVC) card with:
United States Department of Labor, a picture of the bearer on the right with an unobstructed background, the DOL litho printed seal on the left,
a 2 or 3 letter abbreviation representing the region they work in (or near), an PIV number, the bearer’s name, DOL agency and the expiration
date.  The Applicant’s photograph is a one-inch by one-inch color photograph clearly showing the Applicant's face. (See Attachment #7)  The PIV
card is laminated with an official DOL seal hologram overlay.  Located on the back of each card is: “This card is the property of the U.S.
Government and its counterfeiting, alteration or misuse is a violation of Section 499, Title 18 U.S. Code.  If found, drop in mailbox.
Postmaster, postage guaranteed. Return to: U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.  20210.” The language on the back of DOL PIV cards may be
different for those facilities with an electronic access control system.  The color codes are as follows:
Blue: Issued to all DOL employees.  Permits full access to DOL properties.
Red: Issued to DOL contractors, with limited access to DOL properties. The word “Contractor” appears after the DOL agency name.
Green: Issued to DOL contractors, with full access to DOL properties. The word “Contractor” appears on the card after the DOL agency name.

PIV Folder: The PIV Folder is used to document the completion of activities necessary for the issuance of an Applicant’s PIV Card and into which
to file original and photo static copies of PIV Card processing documents, as appropriate.  The PIV Folder contains sensitive personal
information and must be maintained in accordance with the Privacy Act.  Documents to be filed in the PIV Folder include, but are not limited to:
PIV Processing Checklist.  (See Attachment #1.)  Instructions for completion of the actions on the Checklist are found on Attachment #8.
Applicant’s current photograph, which the Applicant presented at PIV Processing.  (Note: This photograph is different from the photograph taken
of the Applicant and placed on his/her PIV card.)
Photo static copy of the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, with photo static copies of the documents used for identity verification
attached (A copy of the Form I-9 can be obtained at: http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf).
Photo static copies of background investigation forms (i.e., Standard Forms (SF) 85, 85P, or 86) and the Security Clearance Record (DL Form 1-
189).
Original Fingerprint Card (SF 87, revised 4-84) for Federal employees and FD-258 (revised  12-29-82) for Contractors, until transmitted as part
of the security investigative package sent to OPM when a photo static copy of the Fingerprint Card will be made.
Request for PIV Card Issuance (Attachment #3).
Remote Location Receipt for Issuance of PIV Card (Attachment #4).
Note: The PIV Folder and associated documents will remain in the secure possession of the PIV Processor, Registrar, or Issuer at all times; at
no time will the Applicant be given access to his/her PIV Folder.
PIV Package: This is the package of documents that must be completed and/or brought by the Applicant to his or her PIV Processing and consists
of:
Two (2) forms of identification in original form at least one of which must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture identification
(ID) as listed on the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. A copy of the Form I-9 can be obtained at:
http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf

appropriate form.), and
An original, current photograph of the Applicant.  (Note: The photograph will not be returned to him or her.)
PIV Processor: This is the individual (Federal employee) that escorts the Applicant during PIV processing and maintains the chain of custody and
security of the PIV Folder until transferred to the Registrar. In National and Regional Offices, the default PIV Processor, unless otherwise
designated by the PIV Requesting Official, will be a staff person within the servicing Human Resources Office.

gain access to other federal buildings and/or information systems while the bearer is on official business.

H.        Approval of  PIV Card Issuance

The Registrar will approve the issuance of a PIV card to the Applicant once both the identity proofing and background investigation requirements
are successfully completed.  The documents required for identity proofing are described above in the Applicant’s Roles and Responsibilities. 
The background investigation requirement is satisfied when:

(1) The National Agency Check and Inquiries NACI) or other appropriate background investigation is initiated (i.e., the completed investigation
forms have been sent to OPM); and

(2) One of the following successful investigation results occurs:
            (a) Favorable results are received on the NACI or other investigation; or
            (b) Favorable results are received on the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the
                  background investigation; or
            (c)  If the NAC results are not received within 5 days after the initiation of the
                  background investigation, favorable results are received on the FBI National Criminal
                  History Check (i.e., the fingerprint check) .

    PIV Card Replacement

The Applicant must submit a request for a new card to the PIV Requesting Official explaining the date and circumstances involving loss of the
PIV card as soon as possible. The PIV Requesting Official will submit the Applicant’s request and the Request for PIV Card Issuance, Part 1, to
the Registrar who will follow established procedures.

Expired Card
The PIV card expires 5 years after the date of issuance.  The Applicant must apply for renewal no more than 6 weeks prior to expiration date. 
The PIV Requesting Official will submit the Applicant’s request and the Request for PIV Card Issuance, Part 1, to the Registrar who will follow
the established identity proofing procedures described in this policy.  However, the Applicant does not have to undergo another background
investigation, unless otherwise subject to reinvestigation (e.g., reinvestigation is required for a security clearance).

J.         PIV Process for Separating Federal and Contractor Employees

All DOL Federal and contractor employees must relinquish their PIV cards upon separation or any circumstances (e.g., transfer or reassignment)
under which the continued possession or use of the card is inappropriate.
The Federal employee’s supervisor or the COTR/Contract Officer must ensure that the employee’s PIV Card is collected.  The supervisor or
COTR/Contract Officer will document the collection of the PIV card on item 1n of DL Form 1-107, Separation Clearance (Attachment #5).
The Federal employee’s supervisor or the COTR/Contract Officer must return the separating employee’s PIV card to the Issuer.
The Issuer will notify the Registrar and the employee’s former Requesting Official of the returned PIV card.
 
K.        Requesting the Appropriate Background Investigation

Attachment #6 contains guidance for determining the appropriate background investigation to initiate on an Applicant, based on the position risk
level and/or sensitivity.  This attachment also explains how to request that OPM provide results on the fingerprint check and NAC portions of
the background immediately, rather than when the entire investigation has been completed.
