Attachment 3 Excerpts from Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award
52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Price (2) Technical Capability to meet the Government's Requirement (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive source selection in which competing offers will be evaluated using LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: A. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked lowest to highest. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each contract line item number to confirm extended amount. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror with the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. B. Technical Acceptability. Next, the Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable in accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures, Table A-1. Technical acceptance will be determined by the offeror's proposal demonstrating a clear understanding of the Government's requirement. The proposals shall be evaluated using the criteria in section 3.1 through section 3.3.1 of specification (Equipment Specification for Long-Wave Infrared Imaging System date 14 November 2012, Spec No. 13723-13-001).

C. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. If the lowest priced offer is judged to be Technically Acceptable, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offeror's proposal. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be Technically Acceptable, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offer is judged to be Technically Acceptable, or until all offers are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision. D. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. E. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. F. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time of acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
