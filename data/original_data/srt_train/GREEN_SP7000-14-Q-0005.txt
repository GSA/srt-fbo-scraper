Part 12 Clauses 52.212-04 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUL 2013) FAR (a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-- (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. (e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-- (1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or (2) ( ) Outside the United States.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply. (a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation. (b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using on-line reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the on-line auction process. The Government intends to use a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction. (c) Prior to or simultaneously with conducting the on-line reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing. (d) The lowest offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the on-line auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction. (e) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE

since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted, the "Not Lead" offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; it will be ineligible for award if the final price in the auction is the tie offer price. (f) An offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction. (g) The following information is provided regarding the procedures to be followed if a reverse auction is conducted. (1) Each offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic Agency's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process. (2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is embedded within the email notification sent by the on-line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator. (3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other offerors' pricing in confidence until after contract award. (4) Any offeror unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control. (5) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection. (6) Training: (i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means. (ii) An employee of an offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a 'trained offeror.' Only trained offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that offerors provide an alternate offeror employee to become a 'trained offeror.' The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the 'trained offeror' designation from any trained offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.

FLAT RATE MONTHLY FEE COPYING PLAN

The Government requires Firm-Fixed Price quotes that provide Flat Rate Prices for all supplies and services sought. The term "Flat Rate Prices" means one monthly price for each Volume Band or Item throughout all months of the contract. An example of "Flat Rate Prices" is a quote of $100.00 per month for each Volume Band 1A piece of equipment for all months of the contact. This $100.00 price per month does not change throughout the contract period. Additionally, if the Government exercises its options to increase quantity or fund subsequent fiscal years, the price per additional piece of Volume Band 1A equipment will be $100.00 per month throughout the contract period. DLA Document Services intends to enter into a Flat Rate Monthly Fee Copying Plan or Operating Lease. Ownership of equipment shall not transfer to the government at any time, including at the end of the order. 2.0 TERMINATION CEILING CHARGES

DLA Document Services seeks to avoid termination ceiling charges for removed or cancelled equipment when there is no longer a bona fide need for the equipment or for functionally similar equipment due to the end user's official reorganization; downsizing; or if the decision is outside the end user's control because the end user has been mobilized and no longer occupies the facility. A contract issued as a result of this Request for Quote may be terminated at any time during a Government fiscal year by the Ordering Agency's Contracting Office responsible for the delivery order in accordance with FAR 52.212-4, paragraph (l) Termination for the Government's Convenience. If a termination for convenience is required by DLA Document Services, the procedures and guidance set forth at FAR 52.212-4(l) will be adhered to. Any quote or offer that attempts to bind the government to an agreed upon allowable termination charge (other than a ceiling or limit) will be considered unacceptable and will not be considered for award. QUOTE FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL 1.0 Quote Format:

Each quote shall consist of three (3) separate documents specifically named: "Part 1. Technical Requirements," "Part 2. Past Performance" and "Part 3. Prices". The contents of each part are set forth below. No price information will be included in Parts 1 and/or 2. Quotes will be evaluated as set forth below in "Evaluation Factors for Award". Part 1. Technical Requirements: In Part 1 the quoter must demonstrate compliance with ALL the Technical Requirements set forth in Attachment 1 Performance Work Statement. No price information shall be included in Part 1. Part 2. Past Performance: In Part 2 the quoter must submit no less than two (2) and no more than three (3) customer references for work performed that is relevant and similar in scope to this requirement. Include reference names, telephone numbers, email addresses and a brief description of the work performed. No price information will be included in Part 2. Part 3. Price: In Part 3 the quoter must submit a single monthly price for each Volume Band listed in Section B in the space provided for the unit price. In addition the quoter must provide an extended price for each Volume Band (e.g., Amount shown in the QTY (quantity) X U/P (unit price) = Total). The quoter must then add all the extended prices for a grand total quote. Price quotes must reflect Firm Fixed Pricing.

All quotes shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist listed below no later than November 20, 2013 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time. Email quotes will be accepted. Any quotes received after the closing date and time will be late and will not be accepted. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make award without discussions. Questions should also be addressed in writing or email no later than November 15, 2013 to: DLA DOCUMENT SERVICES ATTN: Paul Watson 5450 Carlisle Pike, Bldg. 9 Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 PHONE: (717) 605-1680 FAX: (717) 605-3999 Email: paul.watson@dla.mil Quoters shall provide a statement that they comply with each paragraph/sub-paragraph of the Performance Work Statement or provide any exceptions on a separate attachment referencing the applicable paragraph/sub-paragraph. Submit only necessary documents for the solicitation, pricing with model number and the descriptive literature and any document required by the Performance Work Statement or called out in the Instructions to Quoters. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD One award will be made to the responsible quoter who meets all the technical factors, has acceptable past performance and results in the lowest price to the government. A. Technical Factors To be technically acceptable each quote must demonstrate it meets all the Technical Factors (including all sub-factors) set forth in the attached Performance Work Statement. This will be evaluated as "pass" or "fail" basis. In order to receive a "pass" rating the quote must clearly demonstrate the ability to provide and perform all services and technical requirements described in the Performance Work Statement. A quote that is evaluated as "fail" for any requirement will not be considered for award. B. Past Performance A past performance review will be conducted to determine whether the Government has confidence that the quoter can successfully perform the requirements set forth in the Performance Work Statement. In conducting its past performance assessment the Government may use both data provided by the quoter and data obtained from other federal Government sources. Past performance will be determined on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. C. Price To ensure fair price analysis, each quoter's price for price analysis purposes will be determined by taking its grand total quote for base period, all option periods and for options for increased quantity. (See Part 3, Price under Format and Submittal above) 52.217-5 -- Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). REVERSE AUCTION After the closing of the solicitation and conclusion of the technical evaluation process, DLA Document Services will conduct a reverse auction via email for this requirement. DLA Document Services will email all technically acceptable vendors the lowest overall bid price (based on initial pricing received for this requirement) for the 36 month requirement. Vendors will be given 2 business days to

SP7000-14-Q-0005

submit revised pricing. After 2 business days, all vendors will be emailed the lowest overall bid price. Vendors will then be given 2 additional business days to submit best and final pricing which will end the Reverse Auction.
