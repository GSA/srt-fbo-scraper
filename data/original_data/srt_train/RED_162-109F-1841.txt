STATEMENT OF WORK
                                       Infrastructure Modernization – Phase I –Server and SAN Replacements
                                                  Occupational Safety and Health Administration
                                                      Directorate of Information Technology


I     PURPOSE

The U.S. Department of Labor, (USDOL), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Directorate of Information Technology (DIT) is
responsible for information resource management of agency information technology projects, including management of systems for the electronic
transmission of occupational safety and health information to OSHA staff, partners and customers.

OSHA’s network hardware has reached the end of its life cycle. DIT has maximized its current configuration, life expectancy, and growth.  OSHA
has begun a network infrastructure modernization project which will be implemented through a phased approach. This phased approach will minimize
the impact on OSHA current staffing and budgetary resources.  This statement of work is to begin building an OSHANet server infrastructure that
will support OSHA’s mobile workforce, improve system performance, provide redundancy for high availability connectivity and disaster recovery,
provide ease of connectivity for emergency response teams, as well as provide for growth to support future OSHA initiatives.

II    BACKGROUND

As an Agency of the U.S. Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (USDOL OSHA) mission is to assure the safety
and health of America's workers by setting and enforcing standards; providing training, outreach, and education; establishing partnerships; and
encouraging continual improvement in workplace safety and health.

III   OVERALL CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE ENVIRONMENT

The OSHANet is an end-to-end private communications facility consisting of:

      • Approximately 140 local area networks (LANs) at various OSHA federal and state sites,  including offshore sites (Puerto Rico and Virgin
        Islands)
      • Approximately 200 servers connected to the network
      • DNS, DHCP and WINS services
      • Approximately 10 centralized e-mail servers
      • Remote access services
      • Two main data centers: one at the National Office in Washington, DC, and the Recovery Site in Salt Lake City, UT.

The infrastructure connects to the National Office (NO) with the Regional, Area, and Field Offices through a MPLS Wide Area network.  Regional,
Area, and Field Offices are connected to the network via a T1 to T3 line speed.  These services are achieved though what is commonly known the
OSHANet, the high level design contains two major elements, WAN and the LAN.

The Wide Area Network (WAN) is the component that links sites and allows OSHA remote sites at different locations to communicate with one
another.  The main component is located in the National Office with a recovery site in Salt Lake City, Utah.   The Local Area Network (LAN) is
limited to a specific location, such as a field office and regional offices and provides access to a variety of information resources.


IV    SCOPE

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Directorate of Information Technology (DIT), is responsible for replacing storage
equipment in the national office located in Washington, DC and the secondary site located in Sandy, UT as well as replacing the required servers
in the national office located in Washington, DC, the secondary site located in Sandy, UT, and the ten (10) OSHA Regional Offices within the
target dates. OSHA/DIT requires the procurement, burn-in, setup and shipment of 2 - new SAN storage equipment to the Washington, DC and Sandy,
UT locations; and procurement and shipment of all servers to the same locations to be completed within 2 months after award.  The new equipment
and associated software must meet all federal mandates.


The equipment and software shall be installed with an OSHA approved configuration, and must pass the federal security certification process.
The majority of the software installed on the new equipment shall be OSHA-furnished licensed commercial applications.

XI    FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

A.    Electronic Product Environmental Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)

      The equipment must be energy star compliant as mandated by the Federal Government and within the United States Department of Energy (DOE)
      standards to improve energy efficiency.

      When applicable, the contractor shall purchase EPEAT-registered green electronic products as required under the Presidential Executive
      Order 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management.


      The EPEAT is designed to help evaluate and compare selected equipment for the following:


         • Ensure that the agency when acquiring an electronic product to meet its requirements, meets at least 95 percent of those requirements
           with an Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool registered electronic product, unless there is no EPEAT standard for such
           product,


         • Enables the Energy Star feature on agency computers and monitors,


         • Establishes and implements policies to extend the useful life of agency electronic equipment; uses environmentally sound practices
           with respect to disposition of agency electronic equipment that has reached the end of its useful life.


      Under the EPEAT program, manufacturers declare their products’ conformance to a comprehensive set of environmental criteria.  Products are
      rated Bronze, Silver and Gold based on how many criteria are met.  EPEAT Gold products must meet all 23 required criteria and at least 75%
      of the optional criteria.
