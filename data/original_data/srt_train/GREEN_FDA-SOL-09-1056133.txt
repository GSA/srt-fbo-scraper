STATEMENT OF WORK


Title:

Technical Support for Operation and Maintenance of Advanced Signal Detection Software for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS).

I. Introduction:

The Statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA),
Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to
ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products.  This document defines the technical services that shall be delivered to
support the software that can detect potential food or cosmetic safety signals in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event
Reporting System (CAERS) database.


II. Background

The detection of safety signals in data from adverse event reports is an important challenge to the FDA and essential for good vigilance; a key
component of FDA’s mission.   The FDA is interested in techniques and tools that are capable of generating, in an automated, reproducible and
systematic way, a set of important and useful safety signals in a graphical illustration of the data that can serve as valuable input to the
overall process of food and cosmetic safety monitoring and review. Safety signals are individual food or cosmetic adverse event combinations
that occur in a higher than expected proportion. These signals need to be carefully investigated to understand if regulatory action needs to be
taken.

The CAERS database is one resource utilized by the FDA for identifying adverse events associated with foods and cosmetics marketed in the United
States. CAERS was originally created in 2003 and contains approximately 50,000 adverse event reports. Reports of adverse events are entered into
CAERS and MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) coding terminology is applied to the verbatim reports of illness and injury.

For managing CAERS signals of potential safety problems, a “signal management” capability shall be provided so that differences in signal
importance and relevance can be accounted for, and documented, so that meaningful priorities can be established for signal evaluation and follow-
up. The term “signal management” in this Statement of Work (SOW) refers to the software capability to detect potential signals of adverse events
related to reports about foods or cosmetics in CAERS. In this SOW, the term “signal” refers to an excess of adverse events compared to what
would be expected to be associated with a product's use. The “management” aspect of signal management refers to the software capability that
enables users to appropriately prioritize the review of potential food and cosmetic safety problems.  Given the size of this database and the
number of new adverse event reports received by the FDA each day, it is imperative that the signal management software be able to demonstrate a
scientifically sound method for balancing sensitivity and specificity in detecting signals in the CAERS database.  In other words, the software
must demonstrate the ability to minimize the over-detection of “false positive” signals while appropriately flagging “true positive” signals.

Currently safety evaluators at FDA CDER use Empirica Signal software system (copyright 2000-2008 Phase Forward Incorporated) to detect and
analyze spontaneous reports of adverse event reports to identify unexpectedly frequent combinations of regulated products and events, and to
organize, identify, and interpret patterns in the data.  FDA CFSAN also had a signal detection contract with Phase Forward.  Prior to the
expiration of the contract with CFSAN in the fall of 2008, Phase Forward placed a copy of CAERS data on CFSAN server number FDSWA093 (the CAERS
data on FDSWA093 has not been refreshed since the contract expired).  Currently CFSAN statisticians can access Empirica Signal software using
the password protected link but there is no technical support or training for this software.  If FDA awards a contract to Phase Forward the
signal detection software will be updated to the current version and used to detect potential food or cosmetic safety signals in the CAERS
database and Phase Forward will provide technical support and services for the operation and maintenance of the signal detection software.  If
the FDA awards a contract to another contractor, that contractor shall be responsible for providing their own advanced signal detection software
that can detect potential food or cosmetic safety signals in the FDA CFSAN CAERS database, in addition to providing technical support and
services for the operation and maintenance of said software.  FDA will not provide access to the Empirica Signal software as a government
furnished property.

III. Objectives

The Office of Information Management (OIM) requires the services of a Contractor to create an environment where CFSAN statisticians can mine
CAERS data independent of the current production system. This environment would also be used to correct product code errors and thus used to
update the current production CAERS database.  Specifically, the Contractor shall:

    • provide and host easy-to-use customizable signal detection software for data mining by multiple users that is capable of detecting,
      quantitatively profiling, graphing, documenting, and tracking safety signals, products of interest, and safety related issues in the CAERS
      database. The software shall allow users to identify safety questions, establish a choice of standards for identifying and characterizing
      safety signals, create custom ad-hoc reports, and design reports for others using CAERS data.  FDA will not purchase the software.


    • obtain services for the operation and maintenance of software designed to detect signals of potential food and cosmetic safety problems,


    • provide a signal annotation feature that allows users to differentiate signals that are disease related,

    • develop a signal annotation feature that allows users to recognize duplicates reports, and/or reports that are linked in some way e.g.
      related individuals,


    • develop alternative data mining techniques to determine approaches most productive for use in generation of safety signals in CAERS data
      and provide application of statistical tools such as time series analysis and logistic regression,

    • identify and perform CAERS data cleaning needs with respect to product and ingredient names and possible product hierarchies; establish
      product hierarchies depending on proposed solutions,  and


    • provide a flexible feature for count data.

IV. Scope

The specific system requirements include:

    • A system that allows CFSAN statisticians to mine CAERS data independent of the current production system.
    • A system that allows product code corrections.
    • A system that can merge with the current production CAERS database with no negative impact to the CAERS data.
    • A system that can be merged with a larger Agency wide adverse event reporting database even as FDA updates its current adverse event
      system.

                 The FDA Project Officer and the Contractor shall discuss appropriate back up for both the signal management pilot and other
                 longer term systems.  All parties shall be informed on the type of backup that is being done and what the limitations of that
                 backup plan are. Database administration functions that require changes to the environments (e.g., install Oracle upgrades,
                 changes to the database structure, etc.) are subject to approval by the DOS/DOI, which meets on a weekly basis. Requests for
                 changes must be submitted by Friday, 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, to be reviewed at the Tuesday Change Control Board (CCB) meetings.
                 Requests are made using the DOS/DOI, Change Request Form (CRF). The Contractor shall coordinate with the DOS/DOI Technical
                 Authority to fill out and submit the necessary CRF. The Contractor shall be available by phone to attend the DOS/DOI meeting
                 when the CRF is presented to answer any technical questions.


                 Rollout to CFSAN shall be implemented in conjunction with the FDA Project Officer.  The Contractor and FDA Project Officer will
                 determine whether modifications to user interface are needed to efficiently identify adverse event signals. This shall be
                 accomplished by developing and delivering onsite training for signal management capabilities at FDA. The contractor shall work
                 with CFSAN staff to build their signal detection skill sets by providing demonstrations and end-user training.  The Project
                 Officer and the contactor will develop a training schedule for up to 10 FDA employees, 30-45 days after the contract award date.


                 The Contractor shall provide technical support to enhance FDA staff  signal management capabilities throughout the project.

           ii) Data Refresh


                 The contractor shall ensure the timely completion of bi-weekly (26 times per year) data refreshes of CAERS data. The CAERS data
                 refreshes shall be loaded in an FDA production server and up to two other servers that are designated by the FDA Project
                 Officer.


                 Tasks necessary to complete this process include:
                 The safety data (raw data and computed signal scores) to support Signal Management shall be derived from CAERS data and shall be
                 refreshed in the production signal management instance on a bi-weekly(26 times per year) basis.  The Contractor shall install
                 signal management capabilities on an OIM provided server in order to support the community of users in CFSAN.  A separate
                 environment shall be provided to support software testing, data staging, quality assurance and training. The CAERS data and
                 signal management information shall be refreshed on the primary server on a bi-weekly (26 times per year)  basis. The CAERS data
                 shall also be refreshed on up to two other servers on a bi-weekly (26 times per year)  basis. The signal management information
                 on the non-primary servers shall be refreshed upon request of the Project Officer in order to support specific testing, quality
                 assurance or training activities.

      6. Software Updates and Signal Management Capabilities

           a. Performance Requirements


           i) FDA requires a new software release to be available 11 months after the contract award date. If the Contractor does not issue a
           new release of the software, the Contractor shall provide the FDA Project Officer with a written justification as to the reason. The
           new software release, or the justification, is to be provided at least 30 to 90 days from the scheduled release date.


           ii) When a new release is available, the Contractor shall notify the FDA Project Officer and DOS/DOI Technical Authority via an email
           message that provides information on the availability of the update, release notes describing the impact of the changes, and a
           proposed schedule for installing the update. The Technical Authority will work with the selected business lead and DOS/DOI to ensure
           that all affected stakeholders are prepared for the update. The Technical Authority also will submit a CRF to the CCB for
           implementation of the change and present the request during the weekly CCB meeting.  The Contractor will be available by phone to
           attend the DOS/DOI meeting when the CRF is presented to answer any technical questions.  The contractor shall implement approved
           software updates on one of the DOS/DOI scheduled maintenance weekends but no later than 30 days after the updates have been approved.

                                                       FDA STANDARD DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT


BACKGROUND


FDA Centers – Bib – centralized IT (security, user authentication, other non-functional requirements) – standard development environments (SDEs)
used as guides for contractors that will develop pieces of integrated systems. The FDA’s SDE is rapidly evolving in response to emerging public
health needs and technology drivers. Due to these imminent changes, it is recommended that this document serve as a recommended guide and not
as a binding source to restrict possible solutions. Optimal and innovative approaches are highly encouraged and desired for this RFI.


Overview


The FDA applications run mainly on a windows platform with some UNIX integration.  The applications themselves, are aging and use different
technologies, mostly custom, that were available ten years ago.  Today, mainstream technical environments focus on component based COTS software
that can be connected through standard API frameworks, rule-based engines, and re-useable code that serves as the primary structure of a
development environment.  FDA must modernize its development environment to leverage the opportunities a standard development provides to enable
the business needs and requirements of data sharing, high-throughput volume validations and business analytics.


The standard development environment


It is the desire of the FDA’s IT Program to create a federated, unified view of a standard application development approach in order to leverage
organizational knowledge, reduce redundancy and develop a common set of architectural standards that should be developed against when delivering
IT applications in the future. In order to promote project standards among projects a standardized development environment to be the target
environment for all new Java Web application development projects has been identified by the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and a working group
of Senior Management Team (SMT) experts.


Figure 1, shown below, describes the target development environment components.  Each component has been carefully selected to play a
specialized role in Java Web Application development, and this configuration is thought to give the developers as well as other members of the
project team the best possible component available to the FDA at the time of this writing.

                                                        SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLAN


The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by the Federal
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business
Utilization (OSDBU) recommend offerors use the following format to submit proposed Individual Subcontracting Plans, including modifications.  It

Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or
offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  “SUBCONTRACT,” as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-
employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor requesting supplies or services required for
performance of the contract or subcontract.

If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Small Business Specialist (SBS) supporting the OPDIV.  SBS contact
information is located on the OSDBU website (http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/staff.html) or you may contact the OSDBU headquarters at (202) 690-7300.

HHS current subcontracting goal is 39.9% for small business, including 8(a) Program Participants (hereafter referred to as SB), 5.00% for Small
Disadvantaged Business, including Alaska Native Corporations (ANC) and Indian Tribes (hereafter referred to as SDB), 5.00% for women-owned
business and economically disadvantaged women-owned business (hereafter referred to as WOSB), 3.00% HubZone business (HUBZone) and 3.00% service
disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed
subcontracting plans to contain at a minimum the aforementioned percentages.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total
estimated subcontracting dollars.  Zero goal statement removed.
   1. Type of Plan (check one)

      be renewed every three years and contractor must provide copy of lead agency approval.


      _____ Commercial products/service plan (goals are negotiated with the initial agency on a company-wide basis rather than for individual
      contracts) this plan applies to the entire production of commercial service or items or a portion thereof. The contractor sells commercial
      products and services customarily used for non-government purposes.  The plan is effective during the offeror’s fiscal year (attach a

Please refer to FAR Part 19.7 for instruction concerning the submission of a Commercial Plan:  SSR is due on 10/30 each year for the previous
fiscal year ending 9/30.

     a. Submit ISR (bi-annually) for the awarding Contracting Officer’s review and acceptance via the eSRS website.


     b.   Currently, SSR (annually) must be submitted for the HHS eSRS Agency Coordinator review and acceptance via the eSRS website.  (Note:
         Log onto the OSDBU website to view the HHS Agency Coordinator contact information (http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/staff.html).


Note:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will indicate whether a subcontracting plan is required.  Due to the nature and complexity of many HHS
contracts, particularly the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), the contractor may not be required to submit its subcontracting reports
through the eSRS.   The Contracting Officer will confirm reporting requirements prior to the issuance of an award.  For more information,
contact Teneshia Alston, Agency Coordinator-eSRS (Teneshia.Alston@HHS.GOV).

7.  Record keeping

FAR 19.704(a) (11) requires a list of the types of records your company will maintain to demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the
requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  The following is a recitation of the types of records the contractor will maintain to
demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  These records will include, but not be
limited to, the following:

     a. SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone and SDVOSB source lists, guides and other data identifying such vendors;

     b. Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone and SDVOSB sources;

     c. On a contract-by-contract basis, records on all subcontract solicitations over $100,000, which indicate for each solicitation (1)
        whether SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone and/or SDVOSB concerns were solicited, if not, why not and the reasons solicited concerns did not receive
        subcontract awards;

     d. Records to support other outreach efforts, e.g., contacts with minority and small business trade associations, attendance at small and
        minority business procurement conferences and trade fairs;

     e. Records to support internal guidance and encouragement provided to buyers through (1) workshops, seminars, training programs, incentive
        awards; and (2) monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program and requirements; and

     f. On a contract-by-contract basis, records to support subcontract award data including the name, address, and business type and size of
        each subcontractor. (This is not required on a contract–by–contract basis for commercial plans.)
     g. Other records to support your compliance with the subcontracting plan: (Please describe)
        _____________________________________________________________


        _____________________________________________________________


        _____________________________________________________________


        _____________________________________________________________




8.  Timely Payments to Subcontractors

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your
subcontracts with small business concerns, 8(a), SDB, women-owned small business, HubZone and service disabled veteran-owned small business
concerns.

Your company has established and used such procedures:  ________ yes _________ no


9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of small, 8(a), small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HubZone small and service disabled veteran owned concerns as
subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make
a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that
liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, SDB,
WOSB, HubZone and SDVOSB small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with
the contracting official prior to approval of the plan.
