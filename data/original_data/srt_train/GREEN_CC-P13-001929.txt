Information System Security Plan (ISSP) The Contractor shall update the acceptable ISSP submitted in their proposal every three years following the effect date of the contract or when a major modification has been made to its internal system. One copy each shall be submitted to the Project Officer and Contracting Officer.

f.

Data Encryption The following encryption requirements apply to all laptop computers containing HHS data at rest and/or HHS data in transit. The date by which the Contractor shall be in compliance will be set by the Project Officer, however, device encryption shall occur before any sensitive data is stored on the laptop computer/mobile device, or within 45 days of the start of the contract, whichever occurs first. 1. The Contractor shall secure all laptop computers used on behalf of the government using a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 compliant whole-disk encryption solution. The cryptographic module used by an encryption or other cryptographic product must be tested and validated under the Cryptographic Module Validation Program to confirm compliance with the requirements of FIPS PUB 140-2 (as amended). For additional information, refer to http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval. The Contractor shall secure all mobile devices, including non-HHS laptops and portable media that contain sensitive HHS information by using a FIPS 140-2 compliant product. Data at rest includes all HHS data regardless of where it is stored. The Contractor shall use a FIPS 140-2 compliant key recovery mechanism so that encrypted information can be decrypted and accessed by authorized personnel. Use of encryption keys which are not recoverable by authorized personnel is prohibited. Key recovery is required by "OMB Guidance to Federal Agencies on Data Availability and Encryption", November 26, 2001, http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/ombencryption-guidance.pdf. Encryption key management shall comply with all HHS and NIH policies (http://intranet.hhs.gov/infosec/docs/guidance/hhs_standard_2007.pdf) and shall provide adequate protection to prevent unauthorized decryption of the information. All media used to store information shall be encrypted until it is sanitized or destroyed in accordance with NIH procedures.

Summary
Column one involves consideration of all the Sections of the Standard that might apply to any deliverable. The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses. ˇ Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type. Some of these may not be features of the vendor's deliverable. Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor's deliverable. If the deliverable involves consideration of additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered. ˇ Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard. Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable. ˇ Column four is a summary of the vendor's response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard. ˇ Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.
