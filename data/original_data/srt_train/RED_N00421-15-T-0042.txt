252.204-7012     SAFEGUARDING OF UNCLASSIFIED CONTROLLED TECHNICAL INFORMATION (NOV 2013)
      (a) Definitions. As used in this clause --
            "Adequate security" means protective measures that are commensurate with the consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or
unauthorized access to, or modification of information.
            "Attribution information" means information that identifies the Contractor, whether directly or indirectly, by the grouping of
information that can be traced back to the Contractor (e.g., program description or facility locations).
            "Compromise" means disclosure of information to unauthorized persons, or a violation of the security policy of a system, in which
unauthorized intentional or unintentional disclosure, modification, destruction, or loss of an object, or the copying of information to
unauthorized media may have occurred.
            "Contractor information system" means an information system belonging to, or operated by or for, the Contractor.
            "Controlled technical information" means technical information with military or space application that is subject to controls on the
access, use, reproduction, modification, performance, display, release, disclosure, or dissemination. Controlled technical information is to be
marked with one of the distribution statements B-through-F, in accordance with DoD Instruction 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical
Documents. The term does not include information that is lawfully publicly available without restrictions.
            "Cyber incident" means actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in an actual or potentially adverse effect on
an information system and/or the information residing therein.
            "Exfiltration" means any unauthorized release of data from within an information system. This includes copying the data through
covert network channels or the copying of data to unauthorized media. "Media" means physical devices or writing surfaces including, but is not
limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, large-scale integration memory chips, and printouts onto which information is
recorded, stored, or printed within any information system.

process sheets, manuals, technical reports, technical orders, catalog-item identifications, data sets, studies and analyses and related
information, and computer software executable code and source code.
      (b) Safeguarding requirements and procedures for unclassified controlled technical information. The Contractor shall provide adequate
security to safeguard unclassified controlled technical information from compromise. To provide adequate security, the Contractor shall-
            (1) Implement information systems security in its project, enterprise, or company-wide unclassified information technology system(s)
that may have unclassified controlled technical information resident on or transiting through them. The information systems security program
shall implement, at a minimum-
                 (i) The specified National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 security controls
identified in the following table; or
                 (ii) If a NIST control is not implemented, the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written explanation of how
-
                       (A) The required security control identified in the following table is not applicable; or
                       (B) An alternative control or protective measure is used to achieve equivalent protection.
            (2) Apply other information systems security requirements when the Contractor reasonably determines that information system security
measures, in addition to those identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic
environment based on an assessed risk or vulnerability.
                       Table 1 -- Minimum Security Controls for Safeguarding
      Minimum required security controls for unclassified controlled technical information requiring safeguarding in accordance with paragraph

      (c) Other requirements. This clause does not relieve the Contractor of the requirements specified by applicable statutes or other Federal
and DoD safeguarding requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) as established by Executive Order 13556, as well as regulations
and guidance established pursuant thereto.
      (d) Cyber incident and compromise reporting.
            (1) Reporting requirement. The Contractor shall report as much of the following information as can be obtained to the Department of
Defense via (http://dibnet.dod.mil//) within 72 hours of discovery of any cyber incident, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause, that
affects unclassified controlled technical information resident on or transiting through the Contractor's unclassified information systems:
                 (i) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS).
                 (ii) Contract numbers affected unless all contracts by the company are affected.
                 (iii) Facility CAGE code if the location of the event is different than the prime Contractor location.
                 (iv) Point of contact if different than the POC recorded in the System for Award Management (address, position, telephone,
email).
                 (v) Contracting Officer point of contact (address, position, telephone, email).
                 (vi) Contract clearance level.
                 (vii) Name of subcontractor and CAGE code if this was an incident on a Sub-contractor network.
                 (viii) DoD programs, platforms or systems involved.

                 (i) A cyber incident involving possible exfiltration, manipulation, or other loss or compromise of any unclassified controlled
technical information resident on or transiting through Contractor's, or it subcontractors', unclassified information systems.
                 (ii) Any other activities not included in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this clause that allow unauthorized access to the Contractor's
unclassified information system on which unclassified controlled technical information is resident on or transiting.
            (3) Other reporting requirements. This reporting in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for additional safeguarding any
cyber incident reporting requirements pertaining to its unclassified information systems under other clauses that may apply to its contract, or
as a result of other U.S. Government legislative and regulatory requirements that may apply (e.g., as cited in paragraph (c) of this clause).
            (4) Contractor actions to support DoD damage assessment. In response to the reported cyber incident, the Contractor shall --
                 (i) Conduct further review of its unclassified network for evidence of compromise resulting from a cyber incident to include,
but is not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data and users accounts. This includes analyzing information systems
that were part of the compromise, as well as other information systems on the network that were accessed as a result of the compromise.
                 (ii) Review the data accessed during the cyber incident to identify specific unclassified controlled technical information
associated with DoD programs, systems or contracts, including military programs, systems and technology; and
                 (iii) Preserve and protect images of known affected information systems and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at
least 90 days from the cyber incident to allow DoD to request information or decline interest.
            (5) DoD damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the
Contractor point of contact identified in the incident report at (d)(1) of this clause provide all of the damage assessment information gathered
in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this clause. The Contractor shall comply with damage assessment information requests. The requirement to
share files and images exists unless there are legal restrictions that limit a company's ability to share digital media. The Contractor shall
inform the Contracting Officer of the source, nature, and prescription of such limitations and the authority responsible.
      (e) Protection of reported information. Except to the extent that such information is lawfully publicly available without restrictions,
the Government will protect information reported or otherwise provided to DoD under this clause in accordance with applicable statutes,
regulations, and policies. The Contractor shall identify and mark attribution information reported or otherwise provided to the DoD. The
Government may use information, including attribution information and disclose it only to authorized persons for purposes and activities
consistent with this clause.
      (f) Nothing in this clause limits the Government's ability to conduct law enforcement or counterintelligence activities, or other lawful
activities in the interest of homeland security and national security. The results of the activities described in this clause may be used to
support an investigation and prosecution of any person or entity, including those attempting to infiltrate or compromise information on a
contractor information system in violation of any statute.
      (g) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g), in all subcontracts, including
subcontracts for commercial items.
