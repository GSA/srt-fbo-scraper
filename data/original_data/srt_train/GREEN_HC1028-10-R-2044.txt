Section G - Contract Administration Data




CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.201-9200     CONTRACTING AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY (JUN 1996)
(G500 Previously)

a.  The contract will be administered by the Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO).  The Contracting Officer (CO) at
DITCO/PL8321, 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225 is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements contained
elsewhere in this contract; the said authority remains solely in the CO.  In the event the contractor effects any such change at the direction
of any other person other than the CO, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the
order costs to cover any increase incurred as a result thereof.

b.  The contractor shall submit requests for modifications of this contract to the CO with a copy of the request to the CO’s representative as
designated in the CO’s representative appointment letter.

c.  Contractual problems, of any nature, that may arise during the life of this contract must be handled in conformance with very specific
public laws and regulations (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation).  Only the CO is authorized to formally resolve such problems.  Therefore,
the contractor is hereby directed to bring all such contractual problems to the immediate attention of the CO.

d. Request for information on matters related to this contract, such as explanation of terms and contract interpretation, shall be submitted to
the CO.

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.232-32     PERFORMANCE-BASED PAYMENTS (JAN 2008)

(a) Amount of payments and limitations on payments. Subject to such other limitations and conditions as are specified in this contract and this
clause, the amount of payments and limitations on payments shall be specified in the contract's description of the basis for payment.

(b) Contractor request for performance-based payment. The Contractor may submit requests for payment of performance-based payments not more
frequently than monthly, in a form and manner acceptable to the Contracting Officer. Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer, all
performance-based payments in any period for which payment is being requested shall be included in a single request, appropriately itemized and
totaled. The Contractor's request shall contain the information and certification detailed in paragraphs (l) and (m) of this clause.

(c) Approval and payment of requests. (1) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of a request for performance-based payment prior to
successful accomplishment of the event or performance criterion for which payment is requested. The Contracting Officer shall determine whether
the event or performance criterion for which payment is requested has been successfully accomplished in accordance with the terms of the
contract. The Contracting Officer may, at any time, require the Contractor to substantiate the successful performance of any event or
performance criterion which has been or is represented as being payable.

(2) A payment under this performance-based payment clause is a contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract and
not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act. The designated payment office will pay approved requests on the
 ______     (Contracting Officer insert day as prescribed by agency head; if not prescribed, insert “30th”) day after receipt of the request for
performance-based payment by the designated payment office. However, the designated payment office is not required to provide payment if the
Contracting Officer requires substantiation as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or inquires into the status of an event or
performance criterion, or into any of the conditions listed in paragraph (e) of this clause, or into the Contractor certification. The payment
period will not begin until the Contracting Officer approves the request.

(3) The approval by the Contracting Officer of a request for performance-based payment does not constitute an acceptance by the Government and
does not excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract.

(d) Liquidation of performance-based payments. (1) Performance-based finance amounts paid prior to payment for delivery of an item shall be
liquidated by deducting a percentage or a designated dollar amount from the delivery payment. If the performance-based finance payments are on a
delivery item basis, the liquidation amount for each such line item shall be the percent of that delivery item price that was previously paid
under performance-based finance payments or the designated dollar amount. If the performance-based finance payments are on a whole contract
basis, liquidation shall be by either predesignated liquidation amounts or a liquidation percentage.

(2) If at any time the amount of payments under this contract exceeds any limitation in this contract, the Contractor shall repay to the
Government the excess. Unless otherwise determined by the Contracting Officer, such excess shall be credited as a reduction in the unliquidated
performance-based payment balance(s), after adjustment of invoice payments and balances for any retroactive price adjustments.

(e) Reduction or suspension of performance-based payments. The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend performance-based payments, liquidate
performance-based payments by deduction from any payment under the contract, or take a combination of these actions after finding upon
substantial evidence any of the following conditions:

(1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of this contract (which includes paragraphs (h) and (i) of this clause).

(2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's (i) failure to make progress, or (ii) unsatisfactory financial condition.

(3) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of any subcontractor or supplier under this contract in the ordinary course of business.

(f) Title. (1) Title to the property described in this paragraph (f) shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the date
of the first performance-based payment under this contract, for property acquired or produced before that date. Otherwise, vestiture shall occur
when the property is or should have been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract

(2) "Property," as used in this clause, includes all of the following described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or should
be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound and generally accepted accounting principles and practices:

(i) Parts, materials, inventories, and work in process;

(ii) Special tooling and special test equipment to which the Government is to acquire title under any other clause of this contract;

(iii) Nondurable (i.e., noncapital) tools, jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps, gauges, test equipment and other similar manufacturing
aids, title to which would not be obtained as special tooling under subparagraph (f)(2)(ii) of this clause; and

(iv) Drawings and technical data, to the extent the Contractor or subcontractors are required to deliver them to the Government by other clauses
of this contract.

(3) Although title to property is in the Government under this clause, other applicable clauses of this contract (e.g., the termination or
special tooling clauses) shall determine the handling and disposition of the property.

(4) The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production under this contract, without requesting the Contracting Officer's approval,
provided that any significant reduction in the value of the property to which the Government has title under this clause is reported in writing
to the Contracting Officer.

(5) In order to acquire for its own use or dispose of property to which title is vested in the Government under this clause, the Contractor must
obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval of the action and the terms. If approved, the basis for payment (the events or performance
criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the
property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with
paragraph (d) of this clause.

(6) When the Contractor completes all of the obligations under this contract, including liquidation of all performance-based payments, title
shall vest in the Contractor for all property (or the proceeds thereof) not--

(i) Delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract; or

(ii) Incorporated in supplies delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract and to which title is vested in the Government
under this clause.

(7) The terms of this contract concerning liability for Government-furnished property shall not apply to property to which the Government
acquired title solely under this clause.

(g) Risk of loss. Before delivery to and acceptance by the Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the title to
which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. If any property is damaged,
lost, stolen, or destroyed, the basis of payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not
in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall
refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Records and controls. The Contractor shall maintain records and controls adequate for administration of this clause. The Contractor shall
have no entitlement to performance-based payments during any time the Contractor's records or controls are determined by the Contracting Officer
to be inadequate for administration of this clause.

(i) Reports and Government access. The Contractor shall promptly furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other pertinent
information requested by the Contracting Officer for the administration of this clause and to determine that an event or other criterion
prompting a financing payment has been successfully accomplished. The Contractor shall give the Government reasonable opportunity to examine and
verify the Contractor's records and to examine and verify the Contractor's performance of this contract for administration of this clause.

(j) Special terms regarding default. If this contract is terminated under the Default clause, (1) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the
Government the amount of unliquidated performance-based payments, and (2) title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of all
performance-based payments, for all property for which the Government elects not to require delivery under the Default clause of this contract.
The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the Default clause.

(k) Reservation of rights. (1) No payment or vesting of title under this clause shall (i) excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations
under this contract, or (ii) constitute a waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.

(2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause (i) shall not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and
remedies provided by law or this contract, and (ii) shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power,
or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any
other right, power, or privilege of the Government.

(l) Content of Contractor's request for performance-based payment. The Contractor's request for performance-based payment shall contain the
following:

(1) The name and address of the Contractor;

(2) The date of the request for performance-based payment;

(3) The contract number and/or other identifier of the contract or order under which the request is made;

(4) Such information and documentation as is required by the contract's description of the basis for payment; and

(5) A certification by a Contractor official authorized to bind the Contractor, as specified in paragraph (m) of this clause.

(m) Content of Contractor's certification. As required in paragraph (l)(5) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the following certification
in each request for performance-based payment:

I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that--

(1) This request for performance-based payment is true and correct; this request (and attachments) has been prepared from the books and records
of the Contractor, in accordance with the contract and the instructions of the Contracting Officer;

(2) (Except as reported in writing on __________), all payments to subcontractors and suppliers under this contract have been paid, or will be
paid, currently, when due in the ordinary course of business;

(3) There are no encumbrances (except as reported in writing on _________) against the property acquired or produced for, and allocated or
properly chargeable to, the contract which would affect or impair the Government's title;

(4) There has been no materially adverse change in the financial condition of the Contractor since the submission by the Contractor to the
Government of the most recent written information dated _____________ ; and

(5) After the making of this requested performance-based payment, the amount of all payments for each deliverable item for which performance-
based payments have been requested will not exceed any limitation in the contract, and the amount of all payments under the contract will not
exceed any limitation in the contract.

2.  CONTRACT TITLE.  Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) Ticketing and Reporting System, BMC Remedy
ITSM with Analytics.

3.  BACKGROUND

DISA Center for Computing Services (CSD) is a provider of information technology solutions for the Department of Defense (DoD).  CSD has adopted
the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) business process model, and is implementing this model throughout the enterprise.  In
order to achieve the full benefits of this process model, ITIL aligned automated tools are necessary. CSD is preparing to deploy an enterprise
wide implementation of the BMC/Remedy IT Service Management (ITSM) application suite.  BMC Analytics for Remedy ITSM is also required to
facilitate CSD ITSM reporting requirements. The implementation will be conducted in three phases – first, the planning, tool deployment and
migration of the prototype sites; second, the migration of the rest of the CSD enterprise less one existing instance of Remedy ITSM at Defense
Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) Ogden; and third, the migration of the DECC Ogden Remedy ITSM instance into the CSD ITSM tool.  The project
will establish new operating environments (OEs) for these tools as part of the CSD Enterprise Systems Management (ESM) architecture.

This project will be implemented as a Firm-Fixed-Price implementation task, and sustained under the “Software as a Service” (SaaS) model.  Under
this model, all required software licensing and application technical support is provided by the contractor.  Government usage levels will be
monitored and adjusted monthly to provide only the staffing, services, and licensing to meet the government’s requirements.

In March 2008, CSD completed an implementation of the Remedy ITSM suite at DECC Ogden to provide dedicated support for the Defense Logistics
Agency (DLA) Enterprise Processing Center (EPC).  This implementation also served as a pilot for the ITSM application, allowing CSD to evaluate
its functionality and performance as a possible enterprise tool for CSD and CSD’s customers.  The evaluation has shown that the product is a
very capable and full-featured service management tool suite, providing automated support for the Incident, Problem, Configuration, Change, and
Service Level Management processes.  Based on this evaluation, CSD management decided to pursue an enterprise-wide deployment of this tool.  A
large portion of the work done in support of this initial ITSM application implementation can be reutilized during the enterprise migration,
particularly in the areas of tool configuration, training materials and procedural documentation.

The DECC Ogden ITSM implementation also clearly highlighted the need for improved reporting support within CSD.  The ITSM application is far
more complex than the existing Trouble Management System (TMS), and the current reporting methods used in TMS are inadequate to support ITSM.
The BMC Analytics product provides the necessary data mining and analysis framework to meet CSD’s ITSM reporting needs.

The overall CSD service support architecture is comprised of three tools – Remedy TMS, Remedy ITSM and IBM Tivoli Asset Management for
Information Technology (TAMIT).  Remedy TMS is the current CSD enterprise service desk support tool.  Remedy ITSM is deployed at DECC Ogden as
the service desk support tool for the DLA EPC environment.  IBM TAMIT is the current CSD Configuration Management support tool, and contains the
enterprise authoritative Configuration Management Data Base (CMDB).  A new Remedy ITSM architecture is to be deployed, and will support the
Incident, Problem, and Service Level Management process functionality; this architecture is the target for the Remedy ITSM software requirement
described in this SOO.  The IBM TAMIT tool will provide the Configuration, Change, and Release Management process support.  Integration between
these applications will be developed by the contractor to ensure that all required process interaction between the tools is accommodated.  Data
from TMS and DLA EPC ITSM will be migrated into the Enterprise Remedy ITSM application.  The Remedy ITSM CMDB will be synchronized with the IBM
TAMIT CMDB to ensure that accurate and current CMDB data is available to Remedy ITSM at all times.  The contractor will be responsible for
coordinating all data migrations and application interfaces, with technical assistance provided by the respective tools’ administrative teams.

The current CSD Government off the Shelf (GOTS) ticketing system is TMS.  There are four major TMS communities in DISA (CSD, Network Services,
Defense Messaging System, and DISANET), each with their own production application deployments.  TMS is a custom ticketing application built
upon Remedy Action Request System; it is comprised of government-maintained Remedy ARS forms, filters, and workflow to create a fully functional
ticketing system that meets DISA’s requirements for a trouble ticket system.  CSD’s DISA Remedy ITSM Software as a Service environment is
required to integrate with the three other communities while becoming the CSD standard for itself and it customers.


4.  OBJECTIVE

The objective of this requirement is to obtain a source to supply the required BMC Remedy ITSM and Analytics Suite software and licenses, and
perform the technical services necessary to design, install, configure, implement, administer, sustain, and provide training for an enterprise
implementation of the Remedy ITSM tool suite using government furnished computing resources.

The implementation will occur in a two year base.  That base will contain firm fixed price milestones, with built in travel costs, and a
gradually increasing sustainment effort.  Four (4) one-year options will also provide sustainment.  Sustainment line items are intended to be a
monthly invoiced mechanism that covers all labor, software, maintenance cost, etc. with the exception of sustainment travel, a pre-authorized
reimbursable.  Monthly invoicing will occur based on scalable pricing per a defined event discovered using a predetermined tool/methodology that
is verifiable by the Program’s staff.  The scalable pricing supports a utility model for the reimbursement of increasing and decreasing event
numbers during that month.

The overall implementation strategy will proceed in three phases:

 • Phase I – Planning, design, and deployment of the enterprise ITSM environment, and migration of the two prototype sites plus CSD Headquarters
   Denver.
   Phase I Planning will consist of information gathering meetings to accurately assess the level of effort for the project and develop project
   management documentation and timelines.  Application design will consist of gathering enterprise process functional requirements through
   documentation review and interviews with process owners and other managers; additionally, application design will include technical and
   information meetings with the CSD TAMIT technical support team to design and implement the process and data integration between the IBM TAMIT
   and Remedy ITSM applications.  This information will be used as the basis for the design solution to be applied to the application.
   Deployment will consist of using the Government furnished development, test, and production computing environments to build, test, and deploy
   the application as designed; the final design of the Government furnished computing environments will be determined during the design phase of
   the contract.  Each individual site migration will consist of interviews with site managers and Service Desk representatives to quantify the
   level of effort for each site’s migration by identifying any unique data collection, procedural and reporting requirements from the legacy TMS
   application that must be accommodated in the enterprise ITSM and reporting applications.  This information will be used to develop an
   enterprise ITSM augmentation and migration plan for the site’s service desks.  The migration phase will include on-site ITSM application
   training, data migration and site operational transition support, all tailored to include the local augmentations.  A Technical Point of
   Contact (TPOC) will be assigned for each migration site to facilitate that site’s migration efforts with a Program Manager (PM) and
   Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  All components of DECC Ogden (except the current DLA EPC Service Desk), DECC Mechanicsburg, and
   CSD-HQ Denver will be migrated during Phase I.

 • Phase II – Migration of the remaining CSD sites, Service Desks and offices using TMS.
   Phase II will consist of the migration of all remaining CSD entities currently using TMS in the manner developed during Phase I planning with
   the incorporation of lessons learned from Phase I.  Phase II will commence upon operational acceptance of Phase I.  The Armed Forces Health
   Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) service desk at DECC Montgomery will be the first service desk migrated in Phase II.

 • Phase III – Migration of the Ogden EPC Remedy ITSM instance into the enterprise ITSM instance.
   Phase III will consist of the migration of the Remedy ITSM implementation at DECC Ogden supporting DLA EPC into the enterprise ITSM suite in
   the manner decided during Phase I planning with the incorporation of lessons learned from Phases I and II.

Enterprise ITSM sustainment will start coincident with the functional stand-up of the production application suite during Phase I.  Sustainment
is estimated to begin approximately six (6) months after contract award; actual sustainment start date will be determined after contract award
during the initial project planning phase.  An on-site administration team is required, with in-office support during normal duty hours and
remote on-call availability at all other times with a 30 minute call-in measure.  Sustainment services will be managed under the “Software as a
Service” model under Manage SW Services Addendum 1.  Under this model, all required software licensing and application administration will be
provided by the contractor in a single variable cost structure invoiced monthly.  Government usage levels will be monitored and adjusted monthly
to provide only the staffing, services, and licensing necessary to meet the government’s requirements.

5.  SCOPE

While the complete project will encompass the entire CSD enterprise, this Statement of Objectives requires successful completion of Phase I
–DECC Ogden, DECC Mechanicsburg and CSD-HQ Denver assessments, application design, deployment, TAMIT integration, and site migrations – before
deployment to the remaining CSD sites as Phase II, and integrating the Ogden EPC Remedy ITSM instance as Phase III.  Under Phase I, on-site
activities will be required at DECCs Ogden and Mechanicsburg, and the CSD Headquarters Denver office.  CSD Headquarters offices as opposed to
operational site locations do not have Service Desk teams with direct customer interface.  Contractor support for headquarters offices will
involve management level assessment of CSD ITIL business processes and supporting the process interaction with the Remedy ITSM tool related to
incident, problem, and service level management functionality as well as reporting and training.

Table 1 below lists all CSD sites that will be involved in this project, and the number of service desks at each.  The table also lists the
number of site staff with ITSM involvement to help assess required level of effort.

The incremental unit for migration will be the Service Desk.  The Service Desk may be organized by customer or function, depending on individual
site structure.  When organized by customer, a consolidated support staff exists to support that specific customer.   When organized by
function, a support staff will provide first line customer contact in specific functional areas. CSD corporate management information will be
consolidated into a single ITSM instance from which separate and distinct ITSM instances will be compiled for each customer, so as to provide
secure protection for each customer’s data.  Custom modifications to the ITSM product will be minimized, so as to reduce the complexity of
implementing vendor-published software updates.  Strong adherence to the standard ITIL processes and their underlying activities is required.
Any deviations from the standard ITIL process shall require CSD management approval prior to implementation.

After completion of all Phase I tasks, the project will enter an operational acceptance period for a minimum of 30 days.  During this time, the
application design, configuration, and function will be operationally validated against the project’s requirements.  Follow-on project phases
will not start until Phase I is operational, stable, and accepted by the Government.

Deployment level of effort for DECC Mechanicsburg shall be used as the planning baseline for the remaining major processing sites.  Minor
processing sites shall be included in the estimates for the nearest major processing site; Dayton shall be migrated along with Columbus, and
both Huntsville and Warner Robins shall be migrated along with Montgomery.  CSD Headquarters Falls Church, Virginia and Chambersburg, PA shall
be stand-alone implementations, similar to the CSD Headquarters Denver, Colorado implementation.

Listed below are the estimated high-level planning milestones for the project.  Actual dates will be determined after contract award during the
initial project planning phase.
    • Phase I project planning shall be completed within two (2) months of contract award. The contractor shall provide detailed project schedule
      and planning documentation for Phase I as well as draft schedule and project plans for Phases II and III.
    • Phase II and III project documentation is to be finalized within two (2) months prior to initiation of these Phases respectively.
    • Phase 1 implementation shall be completed within eight (8) months of contract award.
    • Phase II implementation shall be completed within twelve (12) months of completion and acceptance of Phase I.
    • Phase III shall be completed within four (4) months of completion and acceptance of Phase II.
Any delays shall be documented as to cause and corrective action taken by the contractor on at least a weekly basis.

This project will use DISA-furnished and administered infrastructure resources (computing platforms including all required hardware,
connectivity components, operating system, and Enterprise Systems Management (ESM) utilities) for development, test, and production (i.e.
operating environment).  The operating environments for this project may be virtual, but will be clearly defined.


6.  SPECIFIC TASKS/PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.

7.  SECURITY
 1. The work to be performed under this contract is up to and including the Secret level and application administration positions require IT-I
    for systems access.  The company must have a final or interim Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) from the Defense Industrial Security Clearance
    Office (DISCO).  For contractor employees, it requires a minimum of interim Secret security clearance and interim IT-I eligibility when
    performance starts.  This section shall be considered a supplement to block 13 of the Government provided DD 254, Contract Classification
    Specification.

       References:
        • DOD 5200.2-R, DOD Personnel Security Program.
        • DISAI 240-110-36, Personnel Security.
        • DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.
        • DOD 5220.22-R, Industrial Security Regulation.
        • CSD Security Handbook.

 2. Personnel performing duties under this contract must undergo a favorably adjudicated DOD security investigation that meets or exceeds the
    requirements in Paragraph 7.1 above.  This investigation will be maintained current and requests for periodic reviews will be initiated 6-
    months prior to the anniversary date of the previous investigation.

 3. Adjudication of investigations for granting of interim or final IT-I access will be accomplished through DISA Security.  An exception to
    this is that individual contractor employees with a current investigation that is favorably adjudicated for a Secret or higher security
    clearance by any of the Department of Defense adjudication facilities (DISCO, DIA, ACCF, AFCAF, NAVCAF, WHSCAF) will be automatically
    accepted for final IT-I access.  All personnel performing on this contract will be U.S. citizens.

 4. Pending completion of an appropriate DOD security investigation and final adjudication for security clearance, contractor employees may be
    granted interim authorization to perform duties designated as IT-I. The interim authority for IT sensitive positions is DISA Security.
    Following are the requirements, which must be met prior to granting of interim IT-I authorization:

      • The request for investigation must be submitted by the contractor Facility Security Officer (FSO) through the Defense Industrial
        Security Clearance Office (DISCO) to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for conduct of the investigation.  A copy of the
        investigation forms along with a written request for interim IT-I authorization must be submitted to DISA Personnel Security for
        approval.
      • The National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the investigation or a previous valid NCLC/DNACI/NAC or ENTNAC must be completed and
        favorably adjudicated before interim IT-I access will be granted. An interim Secret clearance should be requested by the contractor FSO,
        for those contractor employees without a previous investigation.

 5. Visit Authorization Letters.  The Contractor FSO will forward requests for facility visits directly to the DISA Visit Access Request (VAR)
    Center via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) using SMO Code:  DKABAA10.

    The Contractor will also forward a Visit Authorization Letter (VAL) to the Contracting Officer’s Representative/Task Monitor identified in
    paragraph 1.0 of this SOW for all employees prior to the beginning of each contracting/task order period of performance and as new
    contractor employees are assigned to the contract.

    The VAL should be sent via one of two methods.  The preferred method is to e-mail the VAL.  Because it contains sensitive information
    covered by the Privacy Act, the VAL should be sent using in a locked “Zip” file in one e-mail and then followed-up by another e-mail with
    the password to unlock the Zipped file.  The alternative method to transmit the VAL is via facsimile (Fax) to the number listed.  Prior
    coordination with the COR should be made via phone to ensure the method of transmission is agreed upon and properly secure.

    The VAL shall be on company letterhead or pre-fabricated form and contain the following information:
      • Contract number with start and end dates
      • Company point of contact (POC) and telephone number
      • Government Task Monitor name and telephone number
      • Complete legal name of employee(s)
      • Social Security Number
      • Security Clearance level, date granted, and
      • Adjudication facility name, i.e. DISCO
      • Type of personnel security investigation (PSI) pending or completed
      • Date PSI completed

7.  Performance Standards.

7.1  The solution will maintain high availability (with a minimum of 98% being acceptable) and will readily adjust to increases and decreases in
user access licenses.  Availability is calculated as the percentage of time that the ITSM system is up and performing normally to the total time
in a measured period, less any supporting network infrastructure, hardware or underlying support software downtime not associated with the ITSM
system itself.  The ITSM system is equal to the aggregate of software components and their connectivity as provided and configured by the
vendor.  The ITSM system is considered down upon failure of any of these key components that prevent customers or site agents from using the
system as designed.  The vendor will respond and correct any deficiencies under the priority scheme and within the timeframes agreed to at
award.

 7.2  The software system must perform consistently for daily ticket volumes up to 3,500 per day with individual web interface transaction
response times not exceeding twenty-five (25) seconds.

ADDENDUM J-3 DISA REQUIREMENTS

                                          DISA ENTERPRISE MANAGED SOFTWARE SERVICES LICENSING, SUPPORT,
                                           CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION and IT ASSET MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS


                                                                As of 01 June 2010


1.0   General


1.1   This addendum, in association with the accompanying Statement of Objectives (SOO), states DISA’s requirements on:

      • DoD software licensing
      • Software entitlements
      • Software maintenance support
      • Information Technology Asset Management (ITAM)
      • Software Investment Management (SIM)
      • Contract administration

The requirements stated within provide the governance over the software products to be provided by the Contractor to DISA.

1.2   In accordance with the terms of this contract, the contractor authorizes DISA operation of the software products on all DISA and
DISA/contractor-supported platforms.

1.3   The contractor-provided software products identified with the contract, but licensed to other DoD and Federal agencies, may be transferred
to DISA and incorporated under the contract to process workloads or mission assignments realigned to DISA.

1.4          The payment due under this contract covers the fees for the respective items noted above.   If DISA does not exercise an option
year, no further payments are due for maintenance or new products.

2.0   DoD SOFTWARE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS

      For this contract, DISA does not own the software.  The software is provided by the contractor as a component of the services provided.
DISA’s payment is based upon monthly usage of the product and technical services provided.

2.1   The contractor shall ensure that the software products and any product enhancements associated with the products provided under this
contract will support commercially available operating systems, hardware, and processing environment technologies including, but not limited to,
the following:


2.1.1 Unix on Intel, Hewlett Packard, and Sun architectures;


2.1.2 Microsoft Windows on Intel architectures;


2.1.3 32-bit and 64-bit hardware architectures;


2.1.4 Virtual operating environments as approved by the respective operating system vendors.



2.2   No “Floor” Levels
              Due to decreasing IT budgets, increasing audits of funded requirements, and DoD policy, the contractor shall not impose minimum
software usage levels to be used by DISA and shall not propose defined growth levels or growth percentages of inventory that must be used by
DISA.



2.3   Calculating DoD Software Services Usage
      The contractor shall provide a managed software and technical services model that clearly states the units of measurement for software
usage and services performed for all applicable environments that can be standardized for the life of the contract.  The contract defines how
software inventory and service units can be increased, decreased, transferred and/or aggregated across the Enterprise on a monthly basis.

2.4   Distributed Processing Models

              Distributed (Server / Mid-Tier) based software and managed service models proposed by the contractor shall address the following:

2.4.1 Industry Standard Units

              Software licensing and maintenance support units shall be expressed in measurements recognized as industry standards (e.g., per
Managed Server, per Site, per CPU/Processor/Core, per User) and rounded to the nearest whole number.  Units shall be clearly defined and easily
discernible by administrators of the contract.

2.4.1.1   Software licensing models shall be applicable in physical/hard and virtual/soft partitioned operating environments.

2.4.1.2  DISA may partition through either physical/hard or virtual/soft partitioning.  DISA shall only pay for software services  for the
partitions on which contractor provided programs are running.


2.4.1.3  The contractor shall provide full support for all products included in this agreement when installed in a partitioned environment with
no special caveats or restrictions, regardless of the 3rd party vendor solution.

2.4.1.4     Managed software costs are predicated only on installed software provided under this contract, which may be operating at less than
the total Central Processing Unit (CPU/Processor) or machine capacity. Charges apply to production software where the provided software is
installed and executed for its intended purpose.

2.4.2 Capacity Increases

               DISA shall have the right to increase the quantity of units (license/server/user/instance) per software product daily, with
payment on a monthly basis throughout the life of the contract as increases in business requirements dictate.  The contractor shall provide
clearly stated pricing in the schedule of supplies and services for capacity increases.

2.4.3 Capacity Decreases

              DISA shall have the right to decrease the quantity of units (license/server/user/instance) per software product daily, with
payment on a monthly basis as reductions in business requirements dictate.  The contractor shall provide clearly stated pricing in the schedule
of supplies and services for capacity decreases.

2.4.4 Reinstatement Fees

             There shall be no reinstatement, reactivation, or relicense fees for software products governed under this contract.



2.5   Non-Production Software Usage
              DISA shall have the right to use the contractor provided software to perform non-production business operations.  There shall be
no additional charge for non-production testing or usage of the contractor provided software products, regardless of the usage levels
established daily/monthly in the contract.  These non-production business operations are critical to the success of computing services for the
DoD and include, but are not limited to, the following areas:
      • Quality Assurance / Quality Acceptance (QA) testing
      • Integration Testing
      • Release Management testing and distribution
      • Disaster Recovery / Continuity of Operations (COOP) / Assured Computing Environment (ACE) testing

2.5.1 Software versions, releases, and maintenance fixes may be subjected to a centralized installation compatibility assurance checkout in a
test environment at a DISA managed facility.  This test environment may or may not be on the same CPU/processor on which the production software
resides.  Software subjected to installation compatibility checkout will not be made available for production, development use, or execution on
other than the test domain.



2.5.2 Disaster Recovery

              Software can be copied and installed for backup and disaster recovery purposes and operated in a backup or disaster recovery mode.
 The same principles apply to DISA’s Continuity of Operations (COOP) and the Assured Computing Environment++ (ACE).


++NOTE: See Section 8.0, ACRONYMS and DEFINITIONS, ASSURED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT (ACE), and Addendum 6, DISA’s Assured Computing Environment
(ACE) Overview for more information on these business practices.


2.5.2.1     Disaster Recovery and Disaster Recovery testing refers to the use of installed software to perform disaster recovery testing,
disaster recovery, and production environment back-up operations.  Disaster recovery software is activated to test a program or in response to a
production outage within the Enterprise.  Software programs may be permanently installed for disaster recovery purposes.  If a production
workload is maintained in a non-disaster recovery situation with permanently installed software products designated for disaster recovery
operations, it will be treated as a permanent capacity change in accordance with the terms of this contract.  Should DISA need to test a
software program or initiate back-up production in response to a production outage, all software programs associated with the original
production environment shall be run as a back-up disaster recovery environment, regardless of capacity thresholds.  There shall be no additional
charges for the first ninety (90) days of disaster recovery testing or back-up production in response to a production outage.  If after ninety
(90) days, the software is still running in a disaster recovery mode on a back-up computer, charges shall be calculated based on the size of the
back-up environment on which the software is operating and in accordance with the terms of this contract.

2.5.2.2     The Government shall have the right to perform Disaster Recovery / COOP testing for up to a maximum of fifteen (15) days per
Disaster Recovery / COOP test for each licensed product at no additional cost.


3.0   DOD SOFTWARE ENTITLEMENTS

      The host of all software products in the contract is DISA.  Software entitlements extend to DISA organizations, DoD customers, Federal
government customers, and authorized agents.

3.1   The contractor provided software and services under the contract may also be used by DISA contractors under obligation of non-
disclosure(s) solely for the benefit of DISA.  DISA shall ensure that each person authorized to use the software is informed of, and agrees to
conform to the obligations of DISA hereunder.


3.2   Contractor provided software products can be transferred between discrete processing environments/systems and facilities where DISA
maintains computing services responsibilities at no additional cost.


3.3   Should there be a restructuring of DISA or its mission during the life of the contract, the contractor agrees that DISA’s contractor
provided software products, capacity levels, usage rights, entitlements and contracts shall transfer to the successor  DoD
organization(s)/Federal Government agency to which DISA may transfer its responsibilities for computing services for the DoD and the Federal
government.

3.4   Change Management
               Installation of software in DISA's processing environments requires strict adherence to policies of the Release Management Change
Advisory Board (RMCAB) process/governance, written notification to the Contracting Officer’s Representative, and incorporation of the software
product(s) into the schedule of supplies and services in the contract.  DISA shall not be held liable for any costs or actions imposed by the
contractor if software products are distributed to DISA or its support centers by the contractor or the contractor’s authorized agents and
installed in DISA’s processing environments without adherence to these policies.


4.0   DoD SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS


      As a Software Service Provider, the contractor is responsible for all aspects of software support as provided to a customer by the software
vendor for a critical, high availability application.


4.1   Releases/Updates/Revisions
               DISA shall be entitled to all new versions, releases, updates, revisions and options of contractor provided software products,
including updates to product documentation as they become generally available (GA) from the software vendor.

4.1.1 New software versions, releases, fixes and upgrades containing the same software functionality as products provided under this contract,
are provided as part of software maintenance support.  The contractor shall make incorporated improvements and enhancements to the software that
has not otherwise been designated as an option available to DISA at no additional charge.  The contractor shall provide support for each
software product version in DISA’s inventory.  DISA shall have the right to bring each software product in its inventory up to the same release
or version level at no additional cost.  (Para N/A for SaaS)


4.1.1.1     For any product covered under the contract, if the software vendor discontinues the product, replaces the product, merges the
product with another product or products, repackages / renames the product or otherwise redesigns the product into another product or products
with similar or equal functionality, DISA shall be entitled to the new product, containing the equivalent functionality, at no additional cost.
If significant functionality improvements are added and the software vendor is charging all other clients for the improved product, the
contractor agrees that it will provide DISA with a trade-in credit equal to the then current list price for the original product, applicable
towards a license for the significantly improved product.  The contractor further agrees that DISA shall receive the same discount for the
significantly improved product that it received when it licensed the original product.  If DISA chooses to retain the original product, the
contractor shall continue full support for twenty-four (24) months after notification of the discontinued support; or the expiration date of the
contract, whichever occurs first. See paragraph 3.3.

4.1.1.2  DISA shall be entitled to, at no additional cost, all improvements and enhancements that are considered part of the software vendor’s
maintenance support.  To receive these enhancements, the software products must be considered an active product in managed service.

4.2   End of Life/Sunsetting (End of Service)

              If software vendor product support is terminated due to either product End-of-Life (EOL) or product “sunsetting”, the contractor
shall provide twelve (12) months notice to the Contracting Officer.    The notice may be provided electronically and should be made at the same
time the product termination notification is made generally available.  The CO or COR will acknowledge receipt of the notice within five
business days following receipt.  The contractor agrees to work with DISA to identify a functional replacement product, costs for the functional
replacement product, possible compatibility concerns and implementation guidance for the functional replacement product.  .


4.3   Managed Software Product / License Reinstatements
      There shall be no reinstatement, reactivation, or relicense fees for software products or licenses redeployed into production.


5.0   IT ASSET MANAGEMENT (ITAM) REQUIREMENTS

5.1   Asset Documentation

      The contractor shall provide the necessary software documentation to ensure DISA is current with the most up-to-date information on the
software vendor’s products deployed within DISA’s Enterprise.  At a minimum, the documentation shall address product functionality,
functionality updates, and product operating specifications referenced by product release dates.

5.1.1 The contractor shall submit to the CO and the COR of the contract an update to the Managed Software Feature List sixty (60) days prior to
each option year of the contract.  The Managed Software Feature List shall be in a Microsoft Excel 200t compatible format acceptable to DISA and
shall include a list of DISA provided products with corresponding product version numbers, which can be referenced to the corresponding
technical documentation.  If there are product dependencies required for certain software products to be operational, contractor will assist in
identifying such dependencies as well as no charge options bundled with the licensed software products and available to DISA.

5.1.2 The contractor shall include component pricing for elements of software products that comprise a bundled or suite of software products if
the individual components are separately priced items or can be deployed separately from the bundled / suite product.  Identification of
individual components within bundled / suite software products is required for configuration management, technical understanding of
functionality and compatibility assurance.

5.2   Schedule of Supplies and Services
5.2.1 The schedule of supplies and services shall accompany line item pricing.  At a minimum, all contractor provided software products required
for DISA's support shall be addressed in the schedule of supplies and services set forth in Addendum 2.

5.2.2 Upon request by DISA, the contractor shall provide an electronic copy of the then current GA products offered by the software vendor.
When a product not listed in the schedule of supplies and services is required, the contractor shall provide a revised draft copy of the
schedule of supplies and services to include the additional product(s).  A contract modification will be executed to incorporate the revised
schedule of supplies and services into the contract.

5.2.3 Due to the critical emphasis on IT asset configuration management and inventory accounting throughout DISA and the DoD, the contractor
shall provide DISA with written notification(s) of changes to product names, descriptions and SKU numbers for products listed in the schedule of
supplies and services as changes occur.  Notification of changes resulting from product upgrades and renaming or repackaging of products shall
be provided as changes.  The contractor shall identify the product name, description and SKU number on the contract to be replaced with the new
product name, description and SKU number (for accurate cross-reference and historical purposes).  Annually, the contractor shall update the
contract's schedule of supplies and services and submit the updated draft schedule of supplies and services to the Contracting Officer (CO) and
the COR of the contract in Microsoft Excel 2003 format for contract modification and incorporation.  For the life of the contract, the product
upgrades and renamed or repackaged products added to the contract shall retain the same firm-fixed prices provided in the schedule of supplies
and services and designated as current versions of these products and services.

5.2.3.1     Sixty (60) days prior to each option year of the contract, the contractor shall provide a cross-reference (“mapping”) of the
products, versions, and/or configuration changes associated with the managed software provided to DISA.  This cross-reference and any product
configuration changes shall be notated in a draft revised schedule of supplies and services that the contractor shall provide to the CO and the
COR of the contract.  Upon review and approval from the COR, any contractor product updates will be used to revise the schedule of supplies and
services of the contract for the upcoming option year.  The revised schedule of supplies and services will be incorporated into the contract as
a contract modification and used as the baseline for the upcoming option year.



5.3   Reallocations

      The contractor agrees transfer or reallocation of software products from site-to-site, machine-to-machine, or Virtual-to-Virtual shall
occur at no additional cost, unless the transfer/reallocation is to a system that incurs a higher usage charge per the schedule of supplies and
services.  Transfers/reallocations to larger machines will result in any applicable payment of the difference at the next monthly invoice
period.  Transfers/reallocations to a smaller machine/LPAR will result in any applicable decrease in payment.

5.4   Inventory Reconciliation
      DISA will conduct and manage the inventory reconciliation process.  Reconciliation of the inventory will be conducted on a monthly basis.

5.4.1 The contractor shall submit a report monthly identifying the number of uses of the managed software products.  DISA will reconcile the
inventory report with their internal usage documentation.   Monthly reconciliation shall occur prior to the vendor submitting an invoice.

5.4.2 Any increases or decreases of usage executed during the month shall be submitted with the reconciled inventory for the appropriate monthly
payment in accordance with the terms of this contract.

5.5   Software Audits
      DISA will conduct, manage and certify all inventory software audits.  During the audit process, the following shall apply:

5.5.1 Only one software audit may be allowed during the life of the contract.  The contractor shall provide a one-hundred twenty (120) day
advanced notification in writing to the COR of the contract when requesting an audit of the contractor’s managed software products in DISA’s
inventory.  The written notification must accompany the reason for the audit request and the specifics of the audit (e.g., what information /
details does the contractor want to see from the audit, suggested timeframes, scope of the audit, identification of authorized contractor POCs
for receiving / reviewing audit results, etc,.).  DISA will validate the contractor’s request and respond to the contractor within thirty (30)
days indicating receipt of the request and potential next steps.

5.5.1.1     The audit will only include DISA managed/maintained non-classified equipment.  Customer-owned equipment and classified
equipment/processing environments shall be excluded.

5.5.1.2      The contractor and/or any authorized agent(s) representing the contractor shall not gain physical or electronic access to DISA
networks, systems or processing environments.

5.5.1.3     DISA resources will schedule, conduct, manage, and validate the software audit.  DISA will capture all resource levels and hours
expended due to a contractor requested software audit, provide associated resource costs commensurate with the resource level pay rates, and
provide the information to the contractor with the results from the audit.

5.5.1.4     If an audit reveals that DISA has understated managed software usage levels, the inventory reconciliation with the contractor shall
be revised to account for the understated levels, thus any usage charges that apply will be adjusted accordingly.

5.5.2 The contractor shall ensure that appropriate measures, processes and resources will be in place to maintain the integrity and security of
the information exchanged.

6.0   CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION

6.1   Confidentiality

    • 100 Percent Inspection.  This level of inspection shall be accomplished by monitoring and documentation.  Each month, the Contracting
      Officer’s Representative (COR), or if so designated the appropriate Technical Point of Contact (TPOC), shall review the generated
      documentation and enter summary results into the Surveillance Activity Record.
    • Random Sampling.  Random monitoring shall be conducted if and when specified in individual task orders. For the potential tasks that have
      been identified so far and included in this QASP, the random monitoring shall be performed by the Project Officer or by the appropriate
      designated Technical Monitor.
    • Periodic Inspection.  Periodic inspections shall be conducted if and when specified in individual task orders.  For the potential tasks
      that have been identified so far and included in this QASP, the appropriate Technical Monitor will perform the periodic inspection..
    • Customer Input.  Customer feedback may be obtained either from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer
      complaints. Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must
      be signed and must be forwarded to the Project Officer.  The Project Officer shall maintain a summary log of all formally received customer
      complaints as well as a copy of each complaint in a documentation file. The Project Officer shall also keep the tabulated results of all
      customer satisfaction surveys on file.


   Task 1 – The primary surveillance method shall be Periodic Inspection.  The contractor shall provide weekly status updates to the government,
   describing all development actions completed and the CSD functional requirements met.  The secondary surveillance method shall be Customer
   Input.  The CSD ITSM user community will test the developed product and validate that all functional requirements are fully and satisfactorily
   met.




   Task 2 – The primary surveillance method shall be Periodic Inspection.  The contractor shall provide weekly status updates to the government,
   describing all installation and configuration actions completed.




   Task 3 – The primary surveillance method shall be Periodic Inspection.  The contractor shall provide weekly status updates to the government,
   describing all implementation actions completed.  The secondary surveillance method shall be Customer Input.  The CSD ITSM user community will
   test the developed product and validate that all functional and data requirements are fully and satisfactorily met.




   Task 4 – The primary surveillance method shall be Periodic Inspection.  The contractor shall provide detailed status updates to the government
   no less frequently than weekly during the implementation phases and no less frequently than twice monthly thereafter, describing all training
   and technical support actions completed.  The secondary surveillance method shall be Customer Input.  The CSD ITSM user community will assess
   and report the quality of training and technical support received to ensure that all methods and materials are effective and comprehensive.




   Task 5 – The primary surveillance method shall be Periodic Inspection.  The contractor shall provide weekly status updates to the government
   during the implementation phases and twice monthly thereafter, describing all application sustainment actions accomplished, issues, and
   planned significant actions for the next three months.  The secondary surveillance method shall be Customer Input.  The CSD ITSM user
   community will assess and report the quality of application service, technical support, and training to ensure that end-user response times
   are satisfactory and all content is accurately maintained.





4. Scope of Performance:


   The contractor shall design, install, configure, deploy, administer, and provide training, technical support, and sustainment services for the
   CSD Enterprise Remedy ITSM software environment.  This environment consists of development, testing, production, and archive systems.  This
   environment provides ITIL-aligned ticketing support for CSD’s incident, problem, and service level management processes, interface to the CSD
   IBM MAXIMO tool, and reporting to support CSD’s operations and key performance indicators.  The system must perform consistently for ticket
   volumes up to 3,500 per day.




   The contractor shall provide this support as a managed service, including provision of software licensing.  Under this model, all required
   software licensing and application technical support is provided by the contractor.  Government usage levels will be monitored and reported,
   and adjusted monthly to provide only the staffing, services, and licensing to meet the government’s requirements.





5. Performance Standards:

    • The solution will maintain high availability (with a minimum of 98% being acceptable) and will readily adjust to increases and decreases in
      user access licenses.  Availability is calculated as the percentage of time that the ITSM system is up and performing normally to the total
      time in a measured period, less any supporting network infrastructure, hardware or underlying support software downtime not associated with
      the ITSM system itself.  The ITSM system is equal to the aggregate of software components and their connectivity as provided and configured
      by the vendor.  The ITSM system is considered down upon failure of any of these key components that prevent customers or site agents from
      using the system as designed.  The vendor will respond and correct any deficiencies under the priority scheme and within the timeframes
      agreed to at award.



    • Individual web interface transaction response times must not exceed an average of ten (10) seconds.




6. Acceptable Quality Level (AQL):


   The AQL for this project is 100% due to the critical support provided by this application to all levels of CSD staff.





7. Evaluation Method:


   The site Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) will document the time of verbal notification to the contractor.  The TPOC will document the
   official time and date of notification on the Maintenance Call Record.  The TPOC will review available self-diagnostic systems logs, conduct a
   comparison with actual maintenance performance and otherwise verify and validate contractor performance.  The contractor shall enter in the
   record the official time the system is restored to full operational status.  The TPOC will confirm the date and time of problem resolution in
   the record, and engage the Contracting Officer's Representative for overall evaluation and to liaison with the Contracting Officer.



8. Remedies:  The following remedies apply.


    • Any minimum standard not met will be officially documented as a negative record in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System
      (CPARS).


    • The PWS and QASP will be modified to identify Performance Objectives and standards for other services as required.


    • If all performance thresholds are met, there will be no adjustment to the invoice amount.
    • If all performance thresholds are not met, the contract value for that year will be reduced by 10%.

DD Form 254 (BACK), DEC 1999
ITEM 13 Continuation

(1)  Contractors may disseminate “For Official Use Only” information to their employees and subcontractors who have a need for the information
in connection with this contract.

      (2)  Removal of the “For Official Use Only” (FOUO) marking or release of FOUO material to the public can only be accomplished by the
Government Cognizant Authority (GCA).

      (3)  “For Official Use Only” information shall be stored in locked receptacles such as file cabinets, desks, or bookcases.  When such
internal security control is not exercised, locked buildings or rooms will provide adequate after-hours protection. During working hours, the
information shall be placed in an out-of-sight location if the work area is accessible to persons who do not have a need for the information.

      (4)  “For Official Use Only” information may be sent via first-class mail or parcel post.  Facsimile communications marked FOUO may be
transmitted by nonsecure terminals with the FOUO marking intact between U.S. Department of Defense, and other U.S. Government agencies, and U.S.
Government support contractors for official purposes.

     5)   When no longer needed, FOUO information may be disposed of by
shredding each copy into pieces to preclude reconstructing, and placing it in a regular trash container.

      (6)  Unauthorized disclosure of “For Official Use Only” information does
not constitute a security violation, but the GCA shall be informed of any unauthorized disclosure.  The unauthorized disclosure of FOUO
information protected by the Privacy Act may result in criminal sanctions. Specific guidance may be found in DOD Regulation 5400.7, DOD Freedom
of Information Act Program.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.204-5      Women-Owned Business (OTHER THAN SMALL BUSINESS)  (MAY 1999)

(a) Definition. Women-owned business concern, as used in this provision, means a concern that is at least 51 percent owned by one or more women;
or in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of its stock is owned by one or more women; and whose management and daily
business operations are controlled by one or more women.

(b) Representation. [Complete only if the offeror is a women-owned business concern and has not represented itself as a small business concern
in paragraph (b)(1) of FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations, of this solicitation.] The offeror represents that it (  ) is a
women-owned business concern.

(End of provision)



52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

Offerors are cautioned to follow the instructions carefully.

(b) The Government will evaluate the soundness of the Contractor’s approach for ensuring that the proposed solution meets the functional and
performance requirements in the Statement of Objectives (SOO), in addition to how the offeror specifically plans to provide a BMC Remedy ITSM
managed capacity service. A Statement of Objectives (SOO) is provided as Attachment J-1 to the solicitation.  This SOO represents the

stated claims.  The proposal shall describe the capability of the offeror’s organization to perform including pertinent aspects of the proposed

and experience and that the Government will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offeror's proposal.

minimize the amount of data submitted as part of the quote. The proposal shall be submitted in five (5) Parts listed below:

Consecutive page numbering within volumes is preferred, e.g., Page I-2-5, indicates Volume I, Section 2, page 5.  Charts, graphs and other
insert materials shall be page-numbered and addressed as attachments. Thus, attachments are to be located in Volume 5 – Associated Contract
Documents for this RFP.  Additional identification of such attachments is permissible.  In the margin on the upper right of all pages include:
Title, Volume, section and page number.

Volume 1 Executive Summary.  The offeror shall provide an executive summary that describes the significant attributes and theme of its quote.
The executive summary should not be more than five (5) pages.

Volume 2 (Factor 1) - Technical Solution.

General

The technical proposal should include all information the offeror desires the Government to consider/evaluate, regarding capability to meet the
SOO.  The proposal should address all aspects of the SOO.  The proposal should be prepared simply and economically, providing straightforward,
concise delineation of capabilities to perform satisfactorily the contract being sought. Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed
art work, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired.

The proposal may not merely offer to perform work in accordance with the proposed SOO, but must outline the actual approach proposed as
specifically as possible.  Particular proposal strengths or unique approaches should be highlighted.  Repeating the requirements without
sufficient elaboration will not be acceptable.  You are not limited to any suggested approaches for equal or even preferred consideration;
however, any deviations should be fully substantiated in the proposal.  In order to ensure a complete proposal, it is recommended that the
offerors follow the format presented below and outline their response by Subfactor.  Additionally, the offeror should cross-index its proposal
elements to the evaluation criteria listed in Section M.  It is the offerors’ responsibility to ensure the completeness of its proposal.  The
evaluation team for the Government has been instructed to evaluate on the basis of the information provided in the proposal.  The Government
will not assume that an offeror possesses any capability unless it is specified in the proposal.

Address technical/management risk by identifying those aspects of the proposal you consider to have the potential for disruption of schedule,
increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and/or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.  The
contractor must classify each risk, provide a rationale for the risk rating, describe the impact of each identified risk, and suggest a
realistic “work-around” or risk mitigation for identified risks.


Volume 3 (Factor 2) - Past Performance.

The past performance references submitted may include either commercial or government contracts performed within three (3) years prior to the
date of release of the solicitation, and having requirements/objectives similar in size and scope to the requirements of the performance work
statement.   The past performance information may include both the prime vendor’s and the subcontractor’s efforts.    No more than two task
orders can be from the same contract.  The offeror shall provide no more than three (3) past performance references using the Past Performance
Form (Attachment J-6).  The offeror shall provide names, addresses (including email addresses), facsimile, and telephone number(s) of point of
contacts (POCs) who have detailed and in-depth knowledge of the work performed on the referenced contract (and/or task order).  If an offeror
has no current or relevant past performance information, then the proposal should state this information in this part or volume.

Volume 4 (Factor 3) Cost/Price

1.  General.   The cost/price proposal must include the proposed unit prices for each of the CLINs/SLINs contained in Addendum B – Supplies and
Services (Attachment B-1) and must be in MS Excel Version 2003.  The Offeror’s cost/price proposal must be complete and include prices for all
of the CLIN/SLINs identified in Addendum B for the entire contract period (i.e., the two year basic period and four one year options).  Failure
to price all of the requirements in Addendum B may result in rejection of the Offeror’s proposal.

The proposal must include supporting data that provides a detailed break-out of the proposed CLIN/SLIN price.  This supporting documentation
will be considered information other than cost or pricing data because of the competitive nature of this solicitation.  However, pursuant to FAR
15.403-5, information other than cost or pricing data may be submitted in the Offeror’s own format unless the contracting officer decides that
use of a specific format is essential and the format has been described in the solicitation.  For this solicitation, the Offeror may choose the
format of the supporting information.

2.   Proposal Preparation Cost.  The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal in
response to this RFP.  The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds
in connection with this procurement.


Volume 5 Associated Contract Documents for this RFP

approved, an email will be sent to the email address of the person who registered.  The email will contain a user id and password that will be
needed when uploading proposals.  The approval of the registration request usually takes about one business day.  This registration process
allows DITCO to precisely track when proposals are uploaded (or attempted to be uploaded).  Offerors are strongly encouraged to register a
minimum of one week prior to uploading a proposal to ensure the proposal upload is accomplished by the closing date and time.  Offerors should
also attempt to upload their proposal as early as possible to ensure no problems arise at the last minute.  If you have any problems, please

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Relative Importance.  The Technical/Management Approach Factor is more important than Past Performance, and when combined Technical/Management
and Past Performance, are significantly more important than Cost/Price.  All subfactors are relatively equal to each other.  Cost/price
proposals will not be rated or scored, but will be evaluated based upon the Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC).

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.


(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

(End of provision)



52.215-9209 AWARD CRITERIA   (JUN 1996)
(M502 Previously)

    a.  The following conditions must be met in order to be eligible for award:

      (1)   The proposal must comply in all material respects with the requirements of the law, regulation and conditions set forth in the
           solicitation.

      (2)   The proposal must meet all solicitation requirements.

     3) The awardee must be determined responsible according to the standards of FAR Part 9, Subpart 1.


M.1 Solicitation Provisions.

M.1.1.  Award.  The Government contemplates the award of one single contract for the BMC Remedy ITSM effort; however, the Government reserves
the right to make no award at all.  Award will be made using the Best Value Tradeoff process and will result in a Firm-Fixed-Price, Performance
Based Acquisition and contract.


M.2.  Evaluation of Offers.

M.2.1. The Government anticipates awarding a contract based on electronically provided written proposals.

M.2.1.1.  Evaluation factors and subfactors include the determination of strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, deficiencies and risks.

M.2.1.2. Written Proposals.  The Government will evaluate the written proposals in accordance with Addendum M.6. below.  When conducting the
evaluation, the Government will consider data included by offerors in their written proposals, as well as past performance data obtained from
other sources.

M.2.1.3. Proposals shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions in Addendum L.  The Government reserves the right to reject any
proposal that does not substantially comply with the instructions provided.

M.2.1.4  Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify any aspect of their proposal or to resolve minor or clerical errors. The government
reserves the right to award without discussions.


M.3 Basis for Award.

M.3.1. The Government intends to conduct the acquisition in accordance with FAR Parts 12.

M.3.2. The Government intends to award a single contract resulting from this RFP.  The Government will select the offer representing the best
value to the Government based upon an assessment of  (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Cost/Price.  Best value means the
expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement
(FAR section 2.101).

M.3.3.   For a proposal to be eligible for award the offeror must either demonstrate a relevant and recent past performance record that provides
confidence in the offeror’s ability to successfully perform as proposed or achieve a Neutral rating; meet all technical requirements of the
solicitation; and conform to all required terms and conditions.

M.3.4.  An evaluation will be made of each offeror’s proposal.  Throughout the evaluation, the Government will consider “corrective potential”
when a deficiency, weakness, or proposal inadequacy is identified.  Proposals unrealistic in terms of Technical Capability, cost/price, or
schedule commitments will be deemed indicative of an inherent lack of comprehension of the complexity and risks of the requirements and may be
rejected.  While the Government evaluation teams and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature,
is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.

M.3.5. The successful offeror shall be actively registered in the CCR Database in order to be eligible for award.  Registration shall be
accomplished via http://www.ccr.gov/ .

M.3.6. The award decision will be based on the Government’s evaluation of each Offeror’s complete proposal against the evaluation criteria
identified in Addendum M.6, below.

M.4. INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK

M.5. Proposal Evaluation Process.

M.5.1. Written Proposals. Offerors shall submit written proposals in an electronic format.  The Technical Capability, Past Performance, and
Cost/Price factors shall be discussed in separate volumes.   The information contained in the written proposals will be used to evaluate
specific factors/subfactors identified below.  The past performance volume will contain points of contact for three (3) recent contracts.
Telephone or email questionnaires maybe used to gather customer input to assess the past performance factor.  The Past Performance information
shall be within the last three years or ongoing from the date of the solicitation release, within DoD, Federal, State or commercial having
requirements similar in scope to the requirements of this solicitation.

M.5.2.   Determination of the Competitive Range.  A competitive range determination may be made based on the evaluation of the written proposals
submitted electronically.  If made, it will include the most highly rated proposals, unless further reduced for the purposes of economy and
efficiency.

M.6.  Evaluation Criteria.

M.6.1. This outlines the Evaluation Criteria the Government will consider in evaluating the offeror’s capabilities and the proposals submitted
in response to the solicitation.  The Evaluation Criteria are intended to show the scope of the evaluation to be performed on proposals
submitted in response to the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Information gathered from the evaluation will be provided to the Source Selection
Authority (SSA) for use in making a source selection decision in accordance with the paragraphs below.  Offerors are cautioned to submit
sufficient information, in the format specified in the Instructions to Offerors, to enable the evaluator(s) to fully ascertain each offeror’s
capability to perform all the requirements contemplated by this solicitation.   Offerors may be asked, at the discretion of the Government, to
provide additional information for clarification.  However, the Government may award without holding discussions.  As a result, the offeror’s
initial proposal should reflect its best effort.


M.6.2. Factors and Sub factors.
The Government will apply evaluation criteria to identify the best value proposal.  The evaluation criteria represent key areas of importance to
be considered in the source selection decision.  The factors and sub factors have been chosen to support a meaningful discrimination between and
among competing proposals.  A technical/management risk rating will be assigned to each technical/management subfactor.

M.6.3. Relative Importance.  The Technical/Management Approach Factor is more important than Past Performance, and when combined
Technical/Management and Past Performance, are significantly more important than Cost/Price.  All subfactors are relatively equal to each other.
 Cost/price proposals will not be rated or scored, but will be evaluated based upon the Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC).

M.6.3. Factor 2 – Past Performance
Past Performance:  (1)  Specify importance:  less important than the technical/management factor.


(1) Ratings.  The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described below.

|TABLE 3- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS                                                                                                    |
|Rating                                      |Description                                                                                      |
|SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE                      |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror|
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE                     |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror    |
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|                                            |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror |
|LIMITED CONFIDENCE                          |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|NO                                          | Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror   |
|CONFIDENCE                                  |will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                                        |
|UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE                          |No performance record is identifiable or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no   |
|                                            |confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.                                         |

 (2) Evaluation Process.  The past performance evaluation considers the offeror’s demonstrated record of performance in providing products and
services that meet users’ needs.  Performance confidence is assessed at the overall past performance factor level after evaluating aspects of
the offeror’s recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the technical/management subfactors and cost/price factor.

(i) Recency Assessment
An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must
have been performed during the past 3 years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this
condition will not be evaluated.

(ii) Relevancy Assessment
The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine how closely the products
provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the technical/management subfactors and cost/price factor, including their relative
order of importance.  For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the relevance of the work performed will generally be assessed for the
technical/management subfactors and cost/price factor (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this procurement may be considered).

Relevancy criteria shall include BMC Remedy, implementation and integration experience, data migration, sustainment experience,  schedule
controls, cost controls, and scope of effort.

A relevancy determination of the offeror’s past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture
partners and major and critical subcontractors.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort,
or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  The
past performance information forms and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy of past
performance.  The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts:

|Degree                                           |Description                                                                               |
|HIGHLY RELEVANT (HR)                             |Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and     |
|                                                 |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                  |
|RELEVANT (R)                                     |Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities |
|                                                 |this solicitation requires.                                                               |
|SOMEWHAT RELEVANT (SR)                           |Past/present performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities |
|                                                 |this solicitation requires.                                                               |
|NOT RELEVANT (NR)                                |Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and        |
|                                                 |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                  |


      (3) Assigning Ratings.  As a result of the relevancy and of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated
performance confidence assessment rating.  Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the
technical/management subfactors and cost/price factor, the resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the factor level and
represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on
past performance is not available or so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably
or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the past performance factor.

More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort.  A
strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating.  Likewise,
a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of
favorable performance.




M.6.3. Factor 3 – Price Factor

(1)  The proposed prices will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.

Completeness:  The team verifies that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are presented
in an adequate format.

Reasonableness:  The reasonableness of the proposed prices will be determined by adequate price competition and/or comparison to the Independent
Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).  In addition, the offeror’s price proposal will be reviewed for unbalanced pricing in accordance with FAR
15.404-1(g).

(2)  The proposed price will be evaluated with respect to the ability of the offeror to meet the requirements specified in the SOO.  The
proposed price will be reviewed to determine if it is realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements,
and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror’s technical proposal.  Results of this analysis may be used in performance risk
assessment and responsibility determinations.

 (3) Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) - Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes based
on the total Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) to include implementation and sustainment activities, and options, over a 6 (six) year period.
The Government will multiply the evaluated price for each of the six years by the appropriate discount factor.  The discounted annual amounts
will then be summed to calculate the total DLCC.  Although the evaluation period will be for 72 months of service, evaluation of option year
pricing shall not be construed to indicate a commitment by the government to exercise all options.  Based on the 2009 nominal interest rate
listed in OMB Circular No. A-94, the discount factors shown below will be used for evaluation.

Evaluation Year (EY)   1     2    3     4    5             6
Evaluation Month (EM)  1-12  13-24      25-36      37-48 49-60   61-72
Discount Factor        .984  .952 .922  .893 .864  .836
