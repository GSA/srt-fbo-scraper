Introduction
This manual is designed to provide a standard set of procedures and philosophies for all Indian Health Service CAD users. The following guidelines and standards are to be implemented within the AutoCAD and Land Desktop environments. The long-term nature of an IHS database requires that all CAD files be created and modified in a consistent manner, so that future users of the database will be able to understand them. Aside from the efficiency resulting from standardization, the primary purpose of this manual is to produce engineering or technical drawings that convey complete instructions with clarity and simplicity to the tribe, as well as to the contractor, consultant, and the various agencies that utilize them. An IHS plan set should be easily recognized by its clean appearance, sharp line work, clear and uniform lettering, well-selected views and simple presentation. The importance of careful presentation cannot be over-emphasized as a prime factor in contributing to the accuracy of bid calculations, and to prevent costly change orders due to unclear or ambiguous interpretations and language. These guidelines are not necessarily all-inclusive, this is a living document and will be updated and enhanced as appropriate. Suggestions for improvements are strongly encouraged so that subsequent updates to this manual will reflect both the input and needs of all CAD users within the IHS Areas.

Forward
This manual covers the basic preparation of project plans using CAD as the method of plan preparation. Effective with the implementation of an area wide standard is an emphasis on drafting practices. The primary hard copy elements achieved within a drawing by standardization are lettering style, symbolization, line style, and line weight. In addition, the elements of standardization within AutoCAD software are more complex. The additional elements of layer structure, color, plot styles, blocks, externally referenced files, database referenced files, drawing templates, profiles and configuration files have added to the preponderance of inconsistency throughout the IHS offices. For this reason the standards presented in this manual must be taken seriously and enforced. In a situation where deviation to the standards and procedures set forth in this manual are warranted, it will be the responsibility of the user to document the deviation in an office CAD file or project folder so that future users will understand the deviation.

Objectives
These standards establish the following objectives: Free the operator and project manager from repeatedly determining the conventions and procedures to be used on each project. Create uniform design, presentation and construction information and establish a clear and precise method of communication. Create a uniform workstation configuration to limit the time and involvement it takes to compile a drawing within the AutoCAD environment. Reduce duplication of effort to increase efficiency. In order to succeed in reaching these objectives it is essential that all staff cooperates in adhering to the standards and procedures set forth in this manual. 4

Drafting Environment
Recommended Workstation System Requirements The following system requirements are essential in order to efficiently implement the procedures as outlined within this manual. OS: Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional 2.4 GHz Pentium IV or Equivalent Processor 1 GB of RAM 40 GB of HD Storage 128 MB Video Graphics Card 10/100/1000 Ethernet NIC 52X or Better CD-ROM Drive With the launch of AutoCAD 2000, it is now practical to create multiple plan sheet layouts within the same project drawing. This feature not only streamlines file management and disk space storage, it eliminates redundant entity creation and drawing updates. Conversely this advancement can create large drawing files, which in turn affects computer performance. The components listed above are minimum standard requirements and will undoubtedly increase with technology. Drafting Software Each CAD workstation will have Autodesk Land Enabled MAP 2005/2006 installed at a minimum if that workstation will only be used for basic drafting, editing and plotting purposes. Design Software Autodesk Land Desktop 2005/2006, Autodesk Civil Design 2005/2006, Autodesk Survey 2005/2006, and Autodesk Raster Design 2005/2006 will be installed on all CAD workstations and laptops that will be used to perform engineering design and survey work. These software packages provide each user with design tools necessary to perform survey data import, surface modeling, horizontal and vertical alignment design, and pipe system design, as well as other design tasks. Software Customization The IHS CAD user will utilize various customized drawing templates, LISP routines, symbol sets, linetypes, blocks, fonts, plot styles and layering scheme as discussed in following sections of this manual. These files will be incorporated and distributed to all users as a device to implement this manual. 5

Amendment Process
Any recurring issues, problems, omissions, specific to this standard should be noted and presented to the area CAD Manager. The modification will then be added to this document and an updated copy will be made available to all.

Project Planning and Setup
Methodology The Project Setup structure as discussed within the following sections of this manual demonstrates a method for managing the various forms of digital data comprising the majority of IHS CAD Databases. This format was developed as a solution to reduce overwriting, project size, redundancy and confusion, especially within a networked, multi-user database. It also allows for integration with future AutoCAD Projects and users, as well as establishing a foundation for GIS Base Mapping. Database Structure/Naming Convention All Land Desktop Project folders/files shall conform to the IHS file naming convention, as described in the following pages. The names shall be accurate to reflect the desired information as per the naming convention. Example of the standard project folder structure is on the left below, and the folder structure is expanded on the right.

Project Naming Convention Project naming for all IHS projects will start with the two-letter area designation followed by the last two digits of the funding year and then the project number, each will by separated be a dash, see the example below.

The drawing name will start with the two letter area designation followed by the last two digits of the funding year, then the project number, followed by type of drawing, each will be separated by a dash, see the example below. Example: TWO LETTER AREA DESIGNATION LAST TWO DIGITS OF THE FUNDING YEAR PROJECT NUMBER AL ­ Albuquerque, New Mexico BE ­ Bemidji, Minnesota CA ­ California NS ­ Nashville, Tennessee PH ­ Phoenix, Arizona TU ­ Tucson, Arizona

I - INDIVIDUAL SCATTERED HOME NAME & SUFFIX) Tribal Base Project

HOME OWNER NAME (LAST NAME & FIRST

A "BASE" Project or composite drawing shall be defined within the CAD database for each reservation served by IHS. As a project is completed and just before being archived it is to be added to this "BASE" or area composite drawing. This drawing will be stored on the network and the folder it's in will have "read only" access. The Office CAD Manager will be responsible for administering the data residing within this directory. Project Coordinate System Each project drawing shall include a minimum of 3 survey quality permanent control points. The coordinate system and survey data used for each project design should match that used by the reservation base project. Points should not have to be rotated or translated, and if feasible should correspond with published benchmarks and monuments for vertical and horizontal control. With survey grade GPS equipment available, IHS engineers and surveyors are encouraged to tie the project coordinate system to a modified state plane coordinate system. This will facilitate future use of the design elements in future LDT projects that can eventually be network to a tribal GIS system. If a consultant furnishes a survey, it shall correspond with the reservation/project coordinate system. Project Archival At the completion of each project (end of construction), project files should be archived on the assigned network "ARCHIVES" drive and also burned to a CD-ROM or DVD. These files should include the AutoCAD drawing files; Land Desktop design files; AutoCAD line and font definition files; and all other associated files. Scanned "as-built" drawings and other project documents such as correspondence shall be included with the archive set. Each archived set should include a "read me" file which describes the archive set, and gives project information such as project manager, date completed, etc. Project Association Before beginning any design work in Land Desktop, a project shall be created using the naming conventions stated above. This project will be the source project for all the Land Desktop specific files used to generate the facilities design. Survey data specific to each facilities design will be processed in this Land Desktop project. The field book points imported will follow the IHS standard feature codes and point numbering series as outlined in the Appendix C. Design Drawings 8

All design drawings will utilize the IHS.DWT standard drawing template and the scattered housing site plans will use the IHS-SH.DWT. The base or background drawing will use the IHS-BASE.DWT in which existing ground contours will be created and XREF'd into the design drawings.. These files will load all standard layers, dim styles, text styles and linetypes as outlined within this manual. The standard IHS drawing template includes standard IHS title blocks for 24x36, full sheet and plan and profile 22x34, full sheet and plan and profile 11x17, and 8.5 x 11 portrait and landscape layout sheets. This file is not to be modified without prior approval from the CAD Manager. When practical, the components of a standard facilities design will encompass the complete plan set within one drawing. An exception would be drawings generated by outside consultants, standard detail drawings and plan sets that are of unusually large size. These will be discussed in the following sections of this manual. The standard insertion point for all drawings/xrefs blocked out of, and inserted into a file, shall be at 0,0,0. This is to ensure uniformity and ease of use for future editing. This applies mainly to XREF's as blocks most likely will be inserted using the insertion point of that particular block. Each plan and profile layout within the drawing shall contain a north arrow and scale bar in the plan view, and a scale bar in the profile view. North arrows, graphic scales, logos, and other similar symbols shall be inserted as blocks and left unexploded. Detail Drawings All standard IHS details are drawn at a 1:1 scale so they can then be inserted into model space and cut into "Model Space Viewports" (MVIEWS) to create paper space detail plot sheets. Externally Referenced Drawings Whenever possible XREFs will be used to keep drawing file size to a minimum. Drawing Coordinate System All design projects will use a known coordinate system (State Plane). Land Desktop provides known US coordinate system models within the software. Choose the correct coordinate system under "Projects" pull down menu, "Drawing Setup." Use of Model/Paper Space Design drafting line work shall be done in model space at 1:1 (1 AutoCAD unit = 1 foot), in decimal units. Additional entities that reside in paper space include the drawing border, general notes, north arrow and scale bar, and sheet-specific legends. These items are to be stored in the BLOCKS folder. General notes and legends and other item that are area specific will be created by that area. Unit Precision Engineering Drawing units shall be set to decimal feet for linear and elevation precision at 3 places to the right of the decimal (.000) but may be changed to 2 decimal places if preferred. Coordinate and angular units shall be set no less than four places to the right of the decimal (.0000). Angles are to be displayed in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Line labels will be displayed as bearings. Text Styles

9

The IHS standard template is predefined with a Leroy style font. With the exception of the cover sheet and Title Blocks, all design annotation will use the Leroy text style. Sample IHS text style at a 1" = 100' plot scale: Name L100 L120 Font Leroy Leroy Model Space Height 10' 12' Paper Space Height .1" .12" Plotted Height .1" .12"

Dimension Styles All dimensioning shall be associative and shall be drawn in the same drawing space as the entity being dimensioned. Since entities will generally be in model space, then dimensions should also be in model space. Dimensions styles are predefined within the IHS standards template. When using dimensions ensure that the objects being drawn are exact. Do not change or override the dimension. If an object within the drawing is to be 3.54'(3' 6 ˝") and the dimension shows 3.56'(3' 6 ž") due to the object not being drawn correctly then correct the object not the dimension. Drawing Scale Drawings for projects will be plotted at a scale commonly used by the engineering and architectural profession; (e.g. 1" = 20', 1" = 30', 1" = 40' ź"= 1'), etc. Vertical scale for cross-sections and profiles will be drawn to a scale in the same ratio as the final plotted product. i.e. if the final plot is horizontal 1"= 20', and the vertical 1"= 2', then the vertical scale is 10 times that of the horizontal so it will be drawn 10 times larger than 1. Plot Utility Plotting shall be done using the page setups from the plot layout tools in AutoCAD paper space environment at a 1:1 scale. The IHS standard templates define a 24x36, 22x34, full size sheet and a half size sheet that plots at 11x17 as well as an 8 ˝ x 11. A custom plot style has been defined for each size. Page Setups will be added to each area as they will differ depending on the plotters utilized at that area. Layers Layer names and content shall remain consistent with those defined in Appendix A. Every effort should be made to ensure that features are shown on the correct layer. The existing layer names should be sufficient for most IHS projects however if a user believes that additional layer names are needed, then an e-mail request must be made to the CAD Manager with the proposed layer names and the justification for them. No other layer names, other than those defined in the layer name list, and this document will be present in drawing files. Exceptions are those layer names automatically created by AutoCAD; "0", "DEFPOINTS", etc. and those created by LDT. Layer 0 shall be kept free of all drawing entities or drawing references. No entities or drawing references shall be created on layer defpoints. In most cases, properties of drawing entities shall be defined "BYLAYER" In AutoCAD. If exceptions are needed notify the CAD Manager of the exceptions so they may be added to the IHS standard. Linetypes

10

At this point the ACAD.lin linetype file and a custom linetype file, IHS.lin will be used. If other linetypes are needed or another linetype file exists notify the CAD Manager of the exceptions so they may be added to the IHS standard. Hatching Hatching is an essential tool in order to enhance the appearance of an object in a design drawing. The symbol of the hatch is the choice of the drafter so long as a few rules are followed. The symbol of the hatch should well represent the intention of the feature. For example, in a concrete sidewalk, a concrete hatch should be used. The scale of the hatch should be small enough so that the symbols can easily be seen. A general rule is half of the drawing scale factor. No hatching should be exploded. Do not hatch a group of objects together. Hatch each object separately so modifications are easier to perform. Use dynamic hatching whenever possible. Symbols IHS shall use the standard symbols that ship with Land Desktop 2005/2006. Existing blocks that are common to each area will also be placed in the symbols folder. Point Groups Point groups are determined from the description key file and will be a part of the prototype. The use of point groups allows the user to quickly add and remove specific groups of points to the drawing. Point Descriptors All survey point data either collected in the field or produced in office shall adhere to a standardized description format. Land Desktop uses description keys to automatically sort survey point data into different layers, to assign descriptions to Land Desktop point entities, and to assign symbols to point entity locations based on the survey point description. This file has been customized to match IHS standards. A printout of this file has been included in Appendix B of this manual.

General Drafting Practices
Everything is drawn in Model Space at 1:1 Everything (when possible) is drawn geo-referenced; that is, where it is in on the ground based on a coordinate system) All line work must be placed on its appropriate layer.

AutoCAD Profile
Definition: You can use the Profiles tab in the Options dialog box to create and save your drawing environment settings as a profile. If you share your workstation with other users who use the same login name, you can restore your options by making the profile current. You can also create and save profiles to use with different projects. By default, AutoCAD stores your current options in a profile named UNNAMED PROFILE. AutoCAD displays the current profile name, as well as the current drawing name, in the Options dialog box. 11

The profile information is stored in the system registry and can be saved to a text file (an ARG file). AutoCAD organizes essential data and maintains changes in the registry as necessary. Once you save a profile, you can export or import the ARG file to and from different computers. If you make changes to your current profile during an AutoCAD session and you want to save those changes in the ARG file, you must export the profile. When you export the profile with the current profile name, AutoCAD updates the ARG file with the new settings. You can import the profile again into AutoCAD to update your profile settings. Each computer will have the standard IHS-LAND2005.arg, IHS-LAND-NET2006.arg, the IHSMAP2005.arg, and the IHS-MAP-NET2006.arg profiles installed; these profiles can be copied to USERNAME-IHS-LAND2005/2006.agr, and USERNAME-IHS-MAP2005/2006.arg. File path options on the FILES tab of the OPTIONS dialog box may not be edited after the initial editing process. The other tab options for the most part can be edited so the CAD environment can be personalized to each users taste.

Land Desktop Generated Layers
Parcel Layers Use the Parcels commands to define, size, and manage parcels. When you define a parcel, its definition is stored in the parcel database file. Because parcel data is stored externally, multiple people working on a network can access it. You can also delete the parcel geometry from the drawing, and import it back to the drawing later. Layer Name PARCELS PARCEL_LBLS Terrain Layers A *- is used to prefix the surface layer names to add the surface name to the front of the following layers. Example: Surface Name: EG Resulting Surface Layers: EG-SRF-BDR, EG-SRF-VIEW, etc. Surface (Terrain Model) Layers Created by Land Desktop Layer Name *-SRF-BDR *-SRF-VIEW *-SRF-FLT *-3D-GRID *-CONT-MNR *-CONT-MJR Explanation Surface Border TIN Layer Surface Breaklines (aka Faults) 3D Faces Minor Contours Major Contours Color 30 7 Linetype Continuous Continuous Explanation Defined Parcels Layer Parcel Labels

Layer colors and linetype will depend on the drawing in which the entities are drawing and the display intent. For example, existing contours will be shown solid on a topographic survey, but may be shown 12

screened and dashed on a proposed grading design. Refer to layer list in Appendix A for additional information. Point Layers Layer Name EZ-* PZ-* Explanation Existing Points Proposed Points

*Use RAW point description from field coding standards and/or Description Key File. This should also correspond with the Point Group Naming Conventions. See the Layer List in Appendix A. Examples: EZ-GRND PZ-WM GS: PWV: GS Proposed Water Valve

Layer colors and linetype will depend on the drawing in which the entities are drawing and the display intent. For example, existing ground shot spot elevations will be shown solid on a topographic survey, but may be shown screened on a proposed grading design. Refer to layer list in Appendix A for additional information.

Alignment Layers The *- is used in the same manner as with the surface layers, in the case of alignments it will prefix the alignment and profile layers with the alignment name. Alignments will be named for what they represent such as Water Main, or Sewer Forced Main followed by a number if there is more than one. Example: Alignment Name: SFM-1 Resulting Alignment Layers: SFM-1-STALBL, SFM-1-STAPTS, etc. Alignment names are as follows: SFM-# SM-# SSL-# WM-# WSL-# SEWER FORCED MAIN SEWER MAIN SEWER SERVICE LINE WATER MAIN WATER SERVICE LINE

Land Desktop Setup Profiles
These are the files used to setup the project drawing files units, scale, coordinate zone, orientation, text style, and borders. IHS will have several to choose from because of the range of scales possible. FILE NAMES: IHS-10.set IHS -30.set IHS -50.set IHS -100.set IHS - 400.set IHS - 20.set IHS - 40.set IHS - 60.set IHS -200.set IHS - 500.set 13

IHS -leroy.stp

IHS - 1000.set

Land Desktop Naming Conventions
DESCRIPTION KEY FILE: The description key file controls both the layers that points go to and the automatic placement of symbols on points (controlled by the point description). Description Keys are case sensitive! FILE NAME: IHS.mdb IMPORTANT: Users MUST load the Land Desktop menu palette and select LABELS/EDIT LABEL STYLES. Select the POINT LABEL STYLES tab. The ACTIVE DESCRIPTION KEYS label style is the current Point Label Style. In the lower right corner of the dialog box it will show that the ACTIVE DESCRIPTION KEYS label style is pointing to the DEFAULT description key file. Select the down arrow next to the DEFAULT description key file and change this to the IHS file. Select the SAVE button to save the changes to the label style. Select OK. This is a one-time setting. Once it is set and saved to the label style, it will continue to use the correct description key file. Surface (Terrain Model, DTM) Naming Convention: A *- is used to prefix the surface layer names to add the surface name to the front of the following layers. EG-(#) Original / Existing Ground ­ Followed by a number (1, 2, 3, etc.) to allow for multiple EG's

FG-(TYPE)-(#) Finished Ground ­ Followed by a number (1, 2, 3, etc.) to allow multiple proposed surfaces. (A proposed surface type ­ lagoons, roads, lots, pads, ponds, etc.) FINAL- Final, Finished Ground (This is the terrain model that all others are pasted into)

Land Desktop COGO Label Styles
Land Desktop includes several default label styles. Each of the four supported object types (lines, curves, spirals, and points) has different label styles. Lines Direction Above, Distance Below Direction Above Direction Below Distance Above Distance Below Direction, Distance Above Direction, Distance Below Stacked Above ­ Distance, Direction Stacked Below ­ Distance Direction

Land Desktop Contour Styles
Contour Styles control how contours and contour labels appear on screen. For example, you can use the Contour Style Manager to apply smoothing to contours and to turn off the display of contour labels.

Civil Design Layers
Profile Layers By using the *- prefix for the profile layers names, Land Desktop will create layer names by using the current alignment name as a prefix. Profiles when generated will be drawn into the drawing on their perspective layers all having the color white and the linetype continuous assigned to each layer. Each user will have the "Prolay.lsp" file loaded in the startup suite of the load application dialog box, the user can type "prolay" at the command line and all the profile layers will be reset correctly and layer 0 (zero) will be set current. The following example shows the profile layers after the PROLAY.LSP file has been run. Layer Name *-PBASE *-PEGC *-PEGCT *-PFGC *-PFGCT *-PGRID *-PGRIDT *-PVGRID Color 2 3 56 1 40 8 7 9 Linetype Continuous Hidden2 Continuous Continuous Continuous Dot2 Continuous Continuous Explanation Profile Base Profile Existing Ground Centerline Profile Existing Ground Centerline Text Profile Finished Ground Centerline Profile Finished Ground Centerline Text Profile Grid Profile Grid Text Profile Vertical Grid

The layers for left and right centerline and left and right centerline text were not included in this standard as they will not be used at this time. The can be added in the future if it is determined that they are needed. Cross Section Layers If you are plotting cross sections that are sampled from multiple surfaces, you can type an asterisk (*) in the Existing Ground Layer box after the name of the layer. This appends the surface name to the end of the layer name so that each plotted existing ground representation is placed on a separate layer. For example, if you sampled the existing ground from surfaces named Rock and Clay, and you typed XEG-* in the Existing Ground Layer box, then the existing ground surfaces in the plotted cross sections are placed on XEG-Rock and XEG- Clay. Layer Name XEG-* XGRID XGRIDT CUT-TCK FILL-TCK CUT-LBL FILL-LBL VOLUME_LBLS Color 3 8 7 1 3 1 3 7 Linetype Continuous Continuous Continuous Continuous Continuous Continuous Continuous Continuous Explanation Cross Section Existing Ground Cross Section Grid Cross Section Grid Text Cross Section Cut Tick Marks Cross Section Fill Tick Marks Cross Section Cut Labels Cross Section Fill Labels Cross Section Volume Labels 16

Pipe Works Layers Using the pipeworks settings, you can specify the overall layer prefix, conceptual plan layer, finish plan layer, and finish plan text layer. Entering an asterisk (*) automatically specifies the current run name as the prefix. Layer Name *CONPL *FINPL *PLTXT *CONPR *FINPR *PRTXT *HYD_GRD Sheet Manager Layers You can specify the layer the view definitions are placed on when you lay out a sheet series. A view definition is a rectangle that surrounds the part of the plan or profile that is displayed on one sheet in the series. View definitions are created when you lay out the sheet series. Layer Name SHEET_VIEWDEF MATCH_LINE FRAME Pipe Run Naming Convention: By default, pipe run names will be used as layer prefixes for layers generated specific to the pipe run. Pipe runs will be named the same as the alignment they reference.

Survey Command Synonyms
The Survey application allows for processing of Figure Codes entered during the data collection phase of a project. Shortcuts (synonyms) for the survey commands can be used to decrease data entry time in the field. Below is a list of standard synonyms. 17

Survey Figure Prefix Library
The Survey application can generate cad linework (Figures) for planimetric features identified during the data collection phase of the project. The beginning, end and geometry of Figures are defined by the use of Figure codes as listed in the previous paragraph. The Figures themselves are automatically created in the drawing based on the sequence of field coding. The Figures are placed on certain layers as determined by the Figure Prefix Library.

3. 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)
(a) Award will be made to the responsible offeror (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/price relationship is the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will evaluate offers on an ordinal basis. The critical factor in making any cost/price trade-offs is not the spread between the non-price evaluation factor ratings, but rather the significance of that difference. The significance of the difference in ratings will be determined on the basis of what that difference is and the risk impact to the Government (positive or negative). Award may not necessarily be made for technical-non-price capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for fulfilling the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The solicitation will utilize a trade-off source selection procedure to make an assessment for best value. The evaluation factors are divided into two categories: Non-Price (Technical) Factors 1-4 and Price, 5. The non-price factors are approximately equal in importance and when combined, are approximately equal to 5 Price.

(b)

No. 1 - Experience performing similar work in conditions under the SOW within the past three years. Experience will be evaluated on: a. Relevancy of the experience to this solicitation's SOW. b. Depth & Breadth of experience. c. Skills, experience and credentials within the firm to accomplish the work stated in this solicitation. Offeror's with greater experience in this factor in relevancy, depth and breadth, associated skills, experience and credentials within the firm with relation to the Statement of Work will receive higher evaluations. Greater value is placed on firms holding an AutoDesk Gold Partner designation and AutoDesk Authorized Training Center partner or equivalent. Experience with projects servicing Government entities and with culturally diverse personnel across wide geographic locales more favorably.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.
