SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1 Method. USHMM will assess Offerors' technical engagement as evidenced by Offeror's commitment to meeting all USHMM's requirements and specifications as stated herein. Each member of the evaluation panel shall be accorded equal weight in his or her rating of proposals, applying the following criteria against the information requested in section L.7.1 et seq. of this
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 27 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

RFP, first individually and independently, and then meeting collectively to establish consensus regarding a technically competitive range. Sub-criteria are generally treated as equivalent and not necessarily prioritized in the order in which they appear. USHMM intends, but is not obligated, to use a qualitative evaluation method for its review. USHMM shall award a contract to the Offeror who thereafter is determined to present the best overall value to USHMM. USHMM reserves the right in all cases to be the sole judge determining whether an Offeror meets the evaluation criteria. M.2 Technical Proposal. USHMM shall evaluate proposals against all criteria stated below:

M.2.1 CRM System Evaluation (fit of the proposed CRM platform and associated third party components and customizations/configurations as Offeror has indicated in the Technical Requirements Matrix to fulfill the requirements further described in Exhibits I and II, and as elaborated by Offeror pursuant to RFP Section L.7.1.1), specifically: M.2.1.1 suitability of the CRM System functional and technical requirements [as elaborated pursuant to RFP Section L.7.1.1.2(1)] and; M.2.1.2 ease of use, productivity, flexibility and reusability, integration and support, and speed/timeliness of implementation [as elaborated pursuant to RFP Section L.7.1.1.2(2) through (6)]. M.2.2 System Integrator Evaluation M.2.2.1 Past Performance - USHMM shall evaluate Offerors on performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontracts for work similar in nature and complexity to this requirement using the following specific factors (see, e.g., Section L.7.1.2.1). USHMM will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. To this extent, USHMM may use information obtained from the Offeror, from calling references, and from sources other than those provided by the Offeror. Too, each Offerors past performance will be evaluated for the quality of services, customer satisfaction, timeliness of performance, business relations, and cost control. The successful Offeror will have demonstrated the following capabilities (note that these subcriteria are not necessarily prioritized in the order in which they appear):     The level of corporate experience as evidenced by successful implementation of projects in other similar or larger agencies/organizations; Completion of projects of this type on budget and on schedule; Corporate viability (an assessment which may be based in part on general vendor staff capabilities and part on independent assessment sources used regularly by USHMM); and Overall impression of prior performance (e.g., quality of services, client satisfaction, timeliness of performance, business relations, and cost control).

M.2.2.2 Staffing Plan/Capability - USHMM shall assess Offerors' staffing plan (see, e.g., Section L.7.1.2.2) to include:

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

28 of 75

[CRM Implementation]

 

The level of experience of staff tasked to this project as Key Personnel as evidenced by experience, education, and certification; and The level of experience of any sub contract staff tasked to this project as Key Personnel as evidenced by experience, education, and certification.

M.2.2.3 Methodology - USHMM shall evaluate the Offerors proposed implementation methodology (see, e.g., Section L.7.1.2.3) to include:  the level of maturity of Offerors respective proposed system development and project management methodologies;  the extent of pre-existing tools and processes to migrate existing data from various data sources and to support a migration from the "as-is" systems" to the "to-be" systems;  the extent to which Offerors overall CRM System approach:  represents a coherent and responsive means to fully implement all 23 major USHMM requirements;  presents advantages and opportunities as a total CRM System solution;  minimizes USHMMs cost and risk; and  delineates the Offerors communications and training methodologies; and  the extent to which the methodology, schedule, risk, Museum staff and vendor level of effort, day 1 functionality, etc. delineated in Offerors Phase I project plan are appropriate. M.3 Business Proposal.

M.3.1 Pricing M.3.1.1 USHMM shall evaluate pricing consistently with inverse correlation to cost such that the lowest price yields the highest rating. M.3.1.2 Since the evaluation of cost will represent a portion of the total evaluation, it is possible that an Offeror might not be selected for award because of unreasonable, unrealistic, incomplete, inaccurate, or noncurrent cost proposal information. Offerors are solely responsible for assuring that pricing information is provided in a manner that allows USHMM to make such a determination. M.3.1.3 Each Offerors cost information will be evaluated for realism, completeness, and reasonableness to determine the Offerors understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract. Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with the technical/management/qualifications of the personnel. Completeness is evaluated by assessing the level of detail the Offeror provides in cost information for all requirements. Reasonableness is evaluated by assessing the acceptability of the Offerors methodology used in developing the cost. The existence of adequate cost competition may support a determination of reasonableness. This includes both original submissions and final proposal revisions (if requested).

M.3.2 Contract Exceptions - Offerors are hereby on notice that substantive and material and/or multitudinous exceptions taken to USHMMs proposed contract language may result in a reduced Business Proposal rating. M.4 WEIGHT. In evaluating proposed CRM system, USHMM considers suitability of the functional and technical requirements (M.2.1.1) to be as important as ease of use, productivity, flexibility and reusability, integration and support, and speed/timeliness of implementation combined (M.2.1.2). Subject to the caveats in section M.5, below, CRM System Evaluation and System Integrator Evaluation are considered equally important and shall be given equivalent weight. The Business Proposal as a whole (pricing & acknowledgement of contract terms), while important, shall nonetheless receive less overall emphasis than the Technical Proposal taken as a whole. Subcriteria are generally treated as equivalent and not necessarily prioritized in the order in which they appear. M.5 COMPLETE INFORMATION & CONTRACTUAL COMPLIANCE.

M.5.1 Failure to furnish complete information requested in the RFP may cause the Offeror to be deemed unacceptable and be removed from further consideration. M.5.2 Offers are solicited on an "all or none" basis and failure to submit offers for all line items listed may be cause for rejection of the offer. M.5.3 Functional requirements include items desired by USHMM and are meant to be comprehensive but not all inclusive. Thus, if USHMM may have omitted a key operational component of a required system that would normally be expected to be included, the Offeror bears the burden of demonstrating the omitted capability.

Exhibit I. Functional Requirements This Exhibit provides key functional requirements for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum for all phases of implementation. These requirements form the basis for the CRM platform selection and will be elaborated and refined for each phase of implementation. In all, the Museum has identified 23 major requirements within Exhibit I and II. It is expected that an eventual platform, of which CRM capability will form the core, will satisfy all of these requirements. There are certain requirements that will serve as the basis for the selection of CRM platform before progressing to the demonstration stage of the selection process. These have been identified as mandatory (Functional Mandatory - FM) or (Technical Mandatory - TM). Other requirements have been identified as desirable (Functional Desired - FD) or (Technical Desired TD). A desirable requirement may be met as part of a core CRM platform OR it may be met by the addition of customization or additional third party software. In any event, the Museum views all mandatory and desirable requirements as necessary for the Museums ultimate fundraising, programs and visitor management solution. It is expected that all functional capabilities identified as mandatory in Exhibit I and II to be demonstrable. In your proposal, please describe the way in which these requirements currently as part of the vendor's standard system, or how it may be modified in the future to support them (see Exhibit VI Evaluation Criteria).

9. Museum and Event Programs Tracking More detailed descriptions of these requirements follow. FM-1. Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) functionality The platform shall support the management and relationship of constituent, network, and program information. It shall also be flexible to allow tiering and grouping of this information. Please refer to the gift relationship illustration example in Exhibit IV under the section The following should be included in the core configuration for constituents:  Name, addresses, email with standard "general data"; gender, age or DOB, nationality/ ethnicity, etc.  Foreign addresses  Maintain multiple names (maiden names, nicknames, etc.) with ability to search all names to get same record; support for foreign names  Name fields must be long enough to avoid truncation of constituent's name or organization  Multiple addresses with designation codes for home/business/seasonal including dates to identify seasonal addresses and manage mailings to them; must have ability to assign a primary or "mail to" address  Multiple contact points: phone #'s, e-mails, web sites, etc.  Multiple salutations (formal & informal, individual & joint, linked to development officers or document signers, etc.)  Suppression/mail codes (quarterly only, newsletter only, "Do Not Solicit", "Do Not Mail", etc.) must be available for listing and selection with all include and exclude logic  Ability to track engagement and event (program) participation for individuals  Ability to record and link 1) individual to individual relationships (e.g., family, friends, etc.) 2) individual to organization relationships (e.g., employee-employer, contact personnel at corporations/foundations, etc.) and 3) organization to organization relationships (e.g., HQ-Branch, Corporation to Matching Gift Foundation, ParentSubsidiary, etc.)  Need multi-valued codes; system must "decode" codes for user understanding  Ability to receive gifts from multiple entities (individual, family foundation, company, etc.) but only send mailings to one.  Automatically update District/Geographical Area based on zip codes  Ability to identify time dependent Constituency Codes to each record (dates associated with the codes so that expiring should be marked as past or former. There should be a process to automatically move someone from "current" to "former" status when the "end date" passes, or in the case of certain constituents, an ability to declare no end date.) For Individuals this would include, but not be limited to:     Donors Members & Past Members Prospects Supporters and brand ambassadors

E-community participants and e-newsletter recipients Volunteers Event Participants Council Members and Groups (& former Council) Individual donor members such as Wings (& former Wings), Founders, and Legacy of Life (LOL) Members USHMM Employees Media Contacts Corporate & Foundation Contacts Legislators Other "influencers" U.S. Government Officials Foreign Government Officials Foreign Policy Professionals Estates of deceased donors Event Hosts (Current & Past) Event Speakers (Current & Past; also include categories such as Celebrity, Business/Philanthropy, Diplomatic Corps., Head of State, Royalty, U.S./Foreign Government official, etc.)

For Organization Constituencies would include, but not be limited to:            Corporations (as donors, employers, and/or Matching Gift companies) Foundations (both corporate & family foundations) Businesses Governmental Agencies Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) International Governmental Agencies Media organizations Jewish Community Organizations & Federations Brokers and others handling Donor Advised Funds (DAFs) Vendors Maintenance of Activity Ticklers (maintaining date, activity, type, responsibility, and results). Ticklers for future activities and histories of actions completed must be maintained. Such ticklers may be used for tracking fund-raising visits, event planning and invitations, or phone contacts for USHMM regional staff.  Ability to track individual donor activity including interactions (both incoming and outgoing), giving, relationships, etc.  Ability to track, report, and display giving results by combined engagement relationships (individuals, spouses, family foundations, businesses and closely-held companies, Donor Advised Funds/DAFs, etc.) Handling of Individuals vs. Households ­ the current Donor Central system generally maintains household rather than individual records which is adequate for direct marketing, but not for major gift fundraising. Please describe your approach to tracking individual distinctives (age, gender,

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

employment, event participation, individual giving, etc.) while facilitating joint mailings and salutations, family giving totals, and other household/family tracking. On-line, interactive vs. batch processing ­ please describe for us what data within vendor's system are entered, validated, and posted in an on-line, interactive mode, and what data are entered and, perhaps, validated on-line and then posted in a batch process. Please explain the reasons for the approach vendor offers and what vendor believes to be the benefits of vendors approach. Recommended use of separate production and reporting machines ­ we understand that certain vendors recommend separate machines for production and reporting. Given the USHMM database size and number of users, please identify vendor's recommendation for us. Describe the impact on the processing and timeliness of reporting data from vendor's recommendation. Please explain what happens in the refresh and overnight processing. We would welcome also any descriptions of other special features (executive information capabilities, mapping interfaces, sales / time management, etc.) or services that vendor believes enhance vendor's system offering. Vendor may also describe any planned enhancements to vendor's application, recognizing that our selection decision will be based on existing, deliverable software. FM-2. Major and Planned Gift Fund-Raising Support Confirm and describe the following capabilities, and direct us to the proper points in vendors documentation for support of the following support mechanisms for our major and planned gift fund-raising efforts:  Prospect and Donor Management - ability to view donors from both the individual giving entity as well as rolled up to a macro view of the individual prospect (ie individual with foundation, family, company, DAF, etc). Prospect management should be able to be tracked at the highest level.  Consituency Coding Management - ability to easily segment, label, view and report on who the donors/prospects are to the Museum (i.e., Member, Member Prospect, Founder, Founder Prospect, Council, Development Committee, Program Committee, etc).  Pipeline and Proposal Management ­ ability to enter stages of fundraising effort (cultivating, ready to solicit, pending proposal, verbal commitment, stewardship, etc) and also maintain status of proposals presented for both major gift and planned gift efforts. Additionally, we need to track ask and expected amounts, dates and likelihoods as well as being able to do so for multiple ask levels to various funds (but for projection purposes knowing that it all rolls up to one ask for that prospect). Specific strategies and next steps from multiple participants must also be easily managed. For planned gifts the system should distinguish between bequest and life income gift expectancies and allow users to maintain both face and present values of gifts and other information typical of deferred gifts. Pipeline automation is desired if a gift comes in and thus requires a stage change to reflect that - please explain how your system recognizes this so that pipeline projections are not inflated with funds already received.
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 34 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

 Portfolio and Gift Table Management - ability to see that a fundraiser has sufficient number of prospects at necessary ask levels in their portfolio in order to meet fundraising target, and enough solicitations in their pipeline to meet monthly, quarterly targets and projections. Also, if a significant ask is rejected that affects the ability to reach target then an alert should trigger.  Solicitor/Relationship Management ­ ability to assign prospects to various staff and volunteers, track status of a prospect in the solicitation cycle, facilitate prospect clearance, summarize results by the relationship manager, and give credit to appropriate and sometimes multiple gift officers.  Screening and Rating ­ ability to store data from multiple individuals or outside services that screen prospects for capacity, propensity and likelihood and ability to maintain internal and external rating system.  Research and Profiles ­ ability to insert standard profile reports for individuals and organizations into standardized fields in order to combine database and word-processed information into a comprehensive and "live" profile.  Contact Reporting ­ ability for staff to remotely access the database and create/enter activity reports on and off site as well as to review contact report data, tickler lists and should include options for confidential note keeping.  Solicitor Management and Reporting ­ ability to track efforts expended and funds raised by individual solicitors, to give multiple solicitors credit for a proposal/ask/gift and, to report giving against specific solicitor goals.  Donor Accounting - ability to track and view giving from both the actual amount from the giving entity as well as from the rolled up macro view; also to see levels of actual giving versus levels of recognition and finally to view giving without any "cost recovery."  Corporate & foundation tracking ­ ability to track proposals, remain aligned with corporate timetables for distribution of philanthropic funds/grants, track philanthropic giving to other non-profits, provide grant reporting support and stewardship needs/schedules.  Tracking and Analysis of Marketing Initiatives  Planned Gift Management - capture and maintain key information about bequests (wills, beneficiary designations on life insurance and retirements accounts, etc.) and life income gifts (e.g., trusts, gift annuities, etc.), noting both face and present values as well as revocable and irrevocable status. For each of these aspects of functionality supporting our fund-raising efforts, please describe vendor's system capabilities and how vendor would accomplish these important objectives. We request that vendor provide examples of how vendor has addressed these requirements for other organizations with complexity similar to ours. FM-3. Direct Response and Membership Fundraising Support Much of the contact that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum makes with its members is through direct response and membership fundraising programs. Membership accounts for approximately 30% of the Museums annual Development revenue, in addition to serving as a critical lead-generator for Major Gifts and Planned Giving.

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

[CRM Implementation]

The Museum works with multiple direct marketing vendors to develop and implement complex strategies, inclusive of segmentation, data output, production & mailing of fundraising materials, receipt & processing of donations, and analysis of integrated direct marketing effectiveness. They rely on the database and account management for a variety of purposes. The USHMM current definition of a member is if they have given a gift - generally under $5,000 -- through direct mail, telemarketing, online or via mobile.  Membership Monthly Expire-Based Renewal Program The system must be able to support an expire-based renewal program, as the type of mailings a member receives is largely dependent on their expiration date. An expiration date is assigned when a person joins the Museum. The expiration date is the last day of the month one year after the date on which they join. The lowest level of Membership is $25, although the Museum accepts gifts of all amounts. There are no benefits associated with gifts less than $25; however, an acknowledgement is sent in response to all giving amounts. During the course of the year, a Member will receive several special appeals. But gifts in response to the appeals will not affect his/her membership expiration date until the renewal window "opens" 4 months prior to his/her expiration date (with month 4 being expiration month). Renewal notices are sent at the end of the month. Data is selected for each monthly renewal effort in the middle of the month prior to the notice mailing (for example, the data for January renewals is selected mid-December and the notices are typically mailed the last week of December.) Members are given two months to respond to the first renewal notice, and then mailed notices monthly as follows: Notice Renewal 1: Renewal 2: Renewal 3: Renewal 4: Renewal 5: Renewal 6: Renewal 7: Renewal 8: Received 3 months before expiration date 1 month before expiration date 1 month of expiration date 1 month after expiration date 2 months after expiration date 3 months after expiration date 4 months after expiration date 5 months after expiration date

If the Member renews between when their renewal window opens and their expiration date ­ his/her new expiration date is 1 year from the old date. In essence, the member receives up to three "bonus" months of membership by renewing early. If the Member renews after his/her expiration date ­ his/her new expiration date is 1 year from the date of the gift.
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 36 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

Any gift received during the renewal window will renew a persons membership. In order to keep the renewals as strong as possible, people receiving Renewals 1 ­ 3 are typically suppressed from all house appeals. All donors receiving Renewals 4-8 will also receive appeal mailings during that time period.  Membership Appeals The Membership program mails approximately 10 appeals a year to approximately 50150K active and qualified lapsed members. The program consists of a mixture of premium (e.g. calendar, notecards, etc.) and non-premium appeals and at least one variable is tested in each mailing. Gifts in response to appeals do not advance a Members expiration date and are coded as "additional gifts," except in cases where the gift is given after the donors membership has lapsed or the gift is given during the donors membership renewal window.  Telemarketing Campaigns Telemarketing is used for 3-4 renewal/reinstatement campaigns a year, in addition to periodic appeal campaigns and efforts aimed at converting members to monthly donors or upgrading the giving amount of current monthly donors.  Tribute Program There are currently four types of tributes: in memory, in honor, in celebration and in tribute. In addition to tribute type and standard donor and transactional information, the name of the honoree and the name and address of the notified party must be captured and the relationship between the three parties must be recognizable in the system. Often times, donors will include a message that they want passed on to the notified party. The system must have a designated space on the transaction level for such messages. In some cases, there are multiple notified parties or no notified parties associated with a tribute gift. The system must be able to clearly distinguish between tributes that have a notified party and those that do not.  Monthly Sustainer Program  Monthly Sustainer payment types include: credit card, checks & EFT  Gift transactional information sharing between credit card processing vendor & database  Database must be able to manage a monthly giving program. Including tracking donors that pledge to become a monthly giver as well as when their payments are due, the original source code that generated the pledge Identifying the donors that are participating in the monthly giving program. Users should be able to log in and see each monthly givers pledge history as well as payments When a monthly giver upgrades their monthly gift, that should be tracked in the system and available for the users

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

[CRM Implementation]

If a monthly donor lapses, that should be easily recognizable for recapturing efforts  If a monthly givers credit card is declined, the database should have the ability to track the reason for the decline as provided by the credit card processing vendor  Integrate with acknowledgment program easily  Acknowledgment Program Acknowledgement/benefit packages are based on predetermined Membership giving levels and transaction amount. The system must be able to indicate on the account level which acknowledgement package a donor received and when the package was mailed. Additionally, the system must provide the following direct marketing capabilities:  Segmentation ­ the system must be able to segment the donor base and assign codes appropriately to the donors and the export files being sent to the direct mail and email firms for actual mailing and member fund raising e-mail efforts. All data files sent to a single direct marketing vendor must be maintained within the system as exported for subsequent analysis.  Direct Marketing Vendor analyses ­ the system must be able to track fundraising success. The system should support mail/tm/email quantities, number of responses, response rate, gross revenue, average gift, gross revenue per thousand, costs, net revenue, cost per thousand, CTRAD and cost per donor, as well as other fundraising tracking information. Vendor cost analysis and ROI and vendor comparisons are also required in addition to the basic response rates.  Lockbox processing ­ All mailings go out with an appeal code and donor ID. Lockbox processors post the donation amount to the gift transactions received from the mailings. The system must be able to accept standard lockbox transaction files for batch posting into the system.  Gift response analysis ­ the system must be able to track individual fundraising efforts and provide summary reporting on metrics including dollars received, response rates, upgrades/downgrades, giving trends, etc. Below, find the frequency of data pulls required by the Membership department and performed externally by the current database vendor account manager:  Acknowledgement & benefits fulfillment files­ weekly  Renewal files ­ monthly  Appeal files ­ approximately 12 per year  Telemarketing files ­ approximately 12 per year  TM Fulfillment files ­ 48 per year  Acquisition suppression files ­ approximately 6 per year  List Rental/Exchange files ­ 4 per year  Monthly & Quarterly Pledge Reminder files ­ 16 per year  Sustainer/PSI processing files ­ 24 per year  E-communication files ­ approximately 20 per year  Ad-Hoc Requests ­ on average 4 per month  Tribute files ­ weekly

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

[CRM Implementation]

For nearly each of these types of activities, USHMM utilizes an "appeal code." It will be important for our new system to maintain this level of detail for comparison of effectiveness from year to year. The appeal code currently used for direct marketing is a 12 digit code and is broken down as follows:  Pos 1 = Activity Type (e.g., A=Annual, G=Matching Gift, P=Planned Giving, etc.)  Pos 2 = Group Type (e.g., M=Membership, D=Development, etc.)  Pos 3 = Program (e.g., A=Acquisition, R=Renewal, W=Web, etc.)  Pos 4-7 = Effort Date (yymm of mailing/event/program)  Pos 8-12 = Project/Event/Segment description abbreviation. Note that the 12 digits above reflect the existing Source/Appeal code for past USHMM efforts (including not only Direct Response, but also events and major gift appeals.) We will need to convert/maintain this information going forward into the new system. In the future it may be also desirable to have the following 1 position codes to track package & letter type as well as RFM coding:  Pos 1 = Package Type  Pos 2 = Letter Type  Pos 3 = Recency (3 month segments to 49+month, etc)  Pos 4 = Frequency (0-1, 2,3,4,5+,nongenerated, unknown...)  Pos 5 = Monetary/Magnitude (past giving amounts) Going forward with a new system, the USHMM would like to be able to identify and renew gifts in the following renewable categories:  Individual  Family/Group  Corporate Additionally, the system should be able to establish/track memberships of the following types:  Complimentary, Family and Lifetime. As previously noted, USHMM has "no internal expertise" on Membership data management and processing as described in Exhibit IV under "Fundraising/Membership". This support is provided through an account management team from a current system/service provider. USHMM will look to get similar support from any new vendor if possible. In your proposal, describe membership processing functionality and account management services that could cover these requirements. Provide examples from other like-Membership programs for which you have experience. FM-4. Processing of all types of Gift Transactions USHMM receives routine and deferred gifts. We receive different gift "tender types" ­ cash, checks, credit cards and EFTs, real and personal property, stocks and securities, and other gifts of varying liquidity. For credit card and EFT gifts, USHMM may have recurring payments in addition to one-time payments. For certain initiatives, USHMM receives items considered as Gifts-in-Kind (GIK). We need to track "Gift Types" (in addition to Tender Types) which include
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 39 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

outright gifts, pledges, pledge payments, GIK, planned gifts, etc. Further, planned gifts may be bequest type gifts or life income vehicles. Many of these gifts have special requirements for valuation and for receipting/ acknowledgment as dictated by the IRS or common practice in fund-raising. For all gifts the system shall provide the ability to record in addition to amount and tender type:  Campaign (objective)  Appeal (solicitation approach; note that many USHMM staff refer to "source" for this coding)  Fund or Designation or G/L Code(use or purpose of the donation)  Solicitor(s) and Region  Dates (received, posted, acknowledged, etc.)  Tribute or Memorial Gifts, if applicable For pledges, all of the same types of information as gifts should be tracked. In addition the system should support standard and custom payment schedules and provide pledge reminders or "billing". In the proposal, describe your facilities for posting, processing and receipting all of these gift types. Please confirm that you distinguish between "gift types" and "tender types". Note that USHMM also has many events as a means of raising funds. The IRS has guidelines for the charitable vs. cost recovery (or Quid Pro Quo) portions of such funds. (The USHMM uses the term "couvert" for this cost recovery portion.) Please briefly describe how your system handles the processing of payments and charitable gifts associated with events. Also note that with gifts and pledges along with any financial transactions, there are often adjustments. Please describe how your system handles such adjustments along with a complete audit trail of all financial transactions. FM-5. Remote Access/Synchronization The Major Gift Officers (MGOs) and Planned Giving Directors (PGDs) and other staff are associated with Regional Offices across the country. But many work out of remote offices or their homes, and many describe their car as their office. The USHMM is looking for a centralized, consolidated system, but all staff whether in a regional office or on the road (in a car, hotel room, or airplane) need to be able to access system data. It is very important that these individuals have access capabilities comparable to staff members working on-site and without compromised functionality. Realizing that a certain amount of remote access is dependent upon the hardware and networking technologies supported by the vendor and the USHMM, please describe vendor's solution for remote access.

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

40 of 75

[CRM Implementation]

If the vendors product supports off-line updating and later synchronization, please also describe that functionality. Can your product support synchronization with mobile devices including smart phones, laptops, iPads and other tablets? FM-6. Campaign Management The system shall have built in campaign management capability and the Campaign management needs to be able to report on both those goals and the actual results of giving against those goals. (Please note that campaign efforts, appeals, and solicitations may be for certain objectives and goals, but donors may choose to give for other purposes. Do not confuse campaign objectives with gift designations; we must be able to report on both separately.) Any of the key objective areas may also have constituency or other sub-objectives. Certain constituencies may have other targets or "sub-sub-objectives." The campaign hierarchy must be able to support goals at each of these four levels, or more, and the system must be able to provide detailed and summary reporting of both goals and actual results at all levels of the hierarchy. Confirm and describe how vendor's system will support our campaign reporting requirements. FM-7. Support for Internet/E-mail based Fundraising and Gift Processing In the current world where so much takes place on the Internet, we must make sure that our new system tracks e-mail and web addresses and supports the USHMM in solicitations and gift processing via the Internet. Please describe the data capture available via the Internet for your system ­ biographic & demographic information including e-mail addresses; gift/pledge/credit card/EFT and other financial transactions; communications and requests for information; event registration; and the like. Does information entered by constituents via the Internet get validated and entered directly into the database? Or is there external validation required/available? Describe the support for sending e-mails either one-up or broadcast from your system. What mechanisms are there for creating and sending e-mail solicitations, for tracking bad addresses and bounces, for tracking responses to e-mail solicitations and response rates, for other aspects of email solicitations? FM-8. Reporting Capabilities The current system typically requires programmer/specialist assistance to get reports from the system. The new system shall allow end users to identify the data to populate simple reports by merely responding to prompts for parameters (gift ranges, constituencies, dates, or other attributes) or by easily creating their own queries. There should be a complete set of standard / example report formats from which they may either choose to use as they are or easily modify for their own, specific purposes.

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

41 of 75

[CRM Implementation]

It is a goal to allow knowledgeable end users to run between 60% and 75% of their own reports without programmer assistance. They should be able to perform the querying, summarization, and formatting of desired reports (or other outputs) on their own. Please describe the reporting tools that vendor provides, either developed internally or through third party tools, to assist end-users in obtaining information from vendors system. Furthermore, please describe the capabilities of these tools to deliver reports in formats that are easily read by executive management, volunteers, or Council members, and to deliver the reports with summarization, font formatting, and other techniques that make them more friendly. Finally, the system shall have either built in business intelligence reporting capability or have open APIs to export data on demand for use in a third party BI tool. Please describe how your systems supports complex and sophisticated analysis of CRM data. FM-9. Functional Information Security and Access There are different types of data that we expect to maintain within our system, much of which is of a confidential nature. Although we wish to make selected data as available as possible, other data needs to be protected from access, and from update or deletion. Separately, individual Regions will have their own donors and constituents. It will be important to maintain the integrity of their donor bases for their fundraising. They wish to be assured that there will not be access to their constituents by other Regions. Please describe how your system will limit/manage this access. Please describe the level of security offered by the system. Describe the systems ability to allow / limit access to data by work function, application screen or data field. There is a requirement to be able to administer, in a simple fashion, the security and access rules for individuals and for groups of individuals. The security system should be able to distinguish among view / display access, edit / change access, and add / delete access. Data or content-sensitive security likely will be desired in certain areas (e.g., an MGO in Chicago - in the Mid-West Region - does not want confidential notes for a key prospect to be accessible by anyone but himself, the Mid-West Director of Development, and a Prospect Researcher). Furthermore, the USHMM desires to be able to limit data through screening; i.e., limit the display of data on screens and on reports by Regions. Please describe the vendor's capabilities in this area. We do expect that the access to data for reporting will be governed by means of the same rules that govern access for display and update. Please confirm this fact. FM-10. PeopleSoft Accounting Interface PeopleSoft Accounting is the museum-wide accounting system. We expect the proposed system to have a standard interface to support all gift and financial transactions to feed data from the development system to our Accounting system. If you do not have an existing, standard interface, you must be able to demonstrate specific, successful experience in interfacing with this package.
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 42 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

This interface must handle all gifts and pledges in accordance with FASB 116 and 117. Such an interface must support a clear audit trail between the two systems and facilitate our periodic reconciliation of data between the two systems. The interface must handle a 20+ position account code. FM-11. Interfaces with other USHMM applications The USHMM's development application needs to exchange data with a number of other systems. Please describe vendor's import / export capabilities. Does vendor have standard input formats for biographic / demographic, financial, or actions / tasks data? What validation does vendor's system perform on batch importing, data replication, and on-line importing? For exporting data, what formats of data does vendor support (e.g., .xls, .dbf, .csv, .doc, .pdf, others)? For certain data, the USHMM may wish to have applications share data via interfaces. For other data, we may wish to allow users to view the related data from two or more applications via a web-based portal. Please identify vendors experience and recommended approaches with the following types of interfaces with as much specificity as possible: External Applications and Vendors:  Transferring/receiving data from Direct Marketing and analysis vendors  Receipt of Lockbox transmittal files  Sending data to and receiving data from external services or applications such as P!N, Wealth Engine, Target America, NCOA, etc.  HEP / CASE matching gifts data bases There are other internal and external databases for which we will also want to discuss interfaces and data sharing as we contract with a vendor for implementation. Please identify which, if any, of these interfaces are part of vendor's standard functionality (with no additional cost.) If vendor has other interfaces that may be useful to a development office, please note them. FD-1. Handling of Hard and Soft Credits The development system must be able to accurately record hard/legal credits for all gifts and financial transactions processed. These are the IRS receiptable transactions which must eventually be fed to the USHMMs PeopleSoft accounting system. In addition, there should be the ability to capture/record soft/recognition credits for spousal gifts, gifts given through family foundations and related companies, matching gifts, United Way designated gifts, and other transactions which need to be tracked from a development viewpoint but not reflected in the accounting books and records.

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

[CRM Implementation]

Please describe how your system handles hard and soft credits. Direct us to your documentation for additional information on these transactions.

FD-2. Volunteer Management Volunteer management is an important issue for the USHMM. Volunteers are used widely to assist with programs and events. We need to be able to track such volunteer interests and availability and the hours they spend. Although this is a high volume activity, it tends to be paced and organized. Although the standard vendor system may be able to capture/record many of the volunteer attributes (biographic and demographic data, skills, interests, certifications, etc.), there is also certain functionality that is desired to help The USHMM personnel track and manage their volunteers.     Work scheduling ­ linking volunteer availability and skills to work to be done Work summarization ­ tracking actual volunteer hours Recognition ­ summarization of hours worked and recognition given to volunteers Communications ­ tracking newsletters and other communications with volunteers

Please describe the functionality that your system provides to meet the needs outlined above. FD-3. Events Management Currently USHMM used CVent as an events management platform and will consider continuing to use that platform with significantly improved integration or complete replacement. The following requirements apply in either case. Please confirm and describe the following capabilities, and direct us to the proper points in vendor's documentation for support of the following support mechanisms for our Events Management:  Event Approval ­ broad budgeting and approval processing for events.  Event Planning and Set-up ­ establishing events of different types (program announcement events, volunteer recognition, conferences, auctions, etc.) with needs for handling budgets; tracking vendors; seating arrangements; speakers and sponsors; premiums and hand-outs, etc.  Event Invitations ­ selecting (and maintaining) groups of individuals to be invited to the events, registering them with different means of fee payment, recording responses to invitations (accepted, declined, no response, etc.)  Event Registration - web based on line registration to both paid and non paid events.  Event Operations ­ preparing rosters, lists, and labels for the event, handling on-site / walk-in registration, work assignments for staff and event volunteers, capturing attendance, etc.

[CRM Implementation]

 Event Evaluation ­ reporting on registrations and fees, revenue vs. expenditures, summarization of attendee evaluations, etc. Please note in vendor's descriptions vendors capabilities for on-line / web-based registration, for on-site support of events, and use of ,,swipe cards or other ID cards to register attendance easily at the event or sub-events. FD-4. Workflow and Document Management We would like to be sure that the vendors CRM solution would support document management within a workflow structure. Following are a couple of examples of the areas where we see/desire workflow management:  As approvals for events are made, the events are assigned to Regions and MGOs and other staff for planning and executing the events. Approval documents should flow to the right people and stay with the actual events.  As MGOs are assigned to donors/prospects they may create proposals (or merely document a verbal proposal. Moving the prospect through the "moves management cycle" may be tracked and documented with Memoranda of Understanding, Proposals, Planned Gift documents, etc. To the extent that workflow processes can reduce the shuffling and filing of hard copy documents we wish to know about this as well. We would anticipate using such capabilities by MGOs, management, in Donor Services, and Accounting. Process Automation. As we review vendor literature, we see the term "process automation." As a non-profit organization, the greater productivity possible by automating predictable events is very important to us. A person responding to a personalized e-mail marketing campaign receives a personalized response containing the next piece of information or link to a service without an administrative assistant needing to answer yet another e-mail... is one simple example of this idea. Please confirm that this type of process automation is part of your workflow solution. Alerts and Business Rules. The system should be able to notify a staff member when certain events occur ­ a donor/prospect dies, a major/expected gift is received, an address of a major prospect changes, etc. The system should support business rules to provide these alerts at a detailed level. Please describe your capabilities to support workflow management, process automation, and alerts and business rules. If you do not offer your own capabilities in this area, please identify any vendor systems that you have linked to your systems. Further, please describe any other workflow capabilities that you offer. Not all data can be reduced to a database format. Please describe how the system facilitates attaching documents (.PDFs, Word docs, pictures, etc.) to a record in the system. Please note security, replication and access issues related to this functionality. FD-5. Duplicate Record Handling
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 45 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

We have noted that there are numerous instances of duplicate records on our database. Certain of these arise through ineffective checking up-front with donor acquisition activities. Others arise as staff do not follow procedures for checking on potential duplicates in adding new individual and organizational donors/prospects. Describe the vendors system capabilities to assist in initial record look-up to avoid entering duplicate records. Describe vendors system capabilities for searching and reporting on potential duplicate records. Describe vendors system capabilities for merging data (biographic, financial, actions / tasks, notes, assignments, images, linked documents, etc.) from one or more duplicate records to another. What reporting is provided from this process? FD-6. Itemized Specific Features There are specific features that we would like to have in our new system. Please describe how vendor would address these needs: Multi-purpose gifts. Donors often make gifts for more than one purpose or designation. Presently we must split these gifts and allocate the check amount to separate gifts with separate receipts, etc. We would like to be able to enter a check as a single gift generating a single receipt with a single linked image of the check (and back-up documentation.) We should be able to generate either a single acknowledgment or multiple acknowledgments noting the full check amount and the individual designations. Please identify how vendor would address this need. Multiple search parameters. The USHMM would like to perform entity searches (a) using various IDs, (b) using zip radii, and (c) phonetically. FD-7. Speakers and resources requests Management of constituents requests for USHMM resources and speakers - USHMM provides information materials including e-newsletters, brochures, DVDs and other materials to constituents outside the Museum. These requests for resources are made through an online form accessible through the URL: http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/take_action/action/resources. In addition, the museum also receives requests for its staff to speak to the Museums various constituents, either while the constituent is visiting the Museum or when they are hosting events in their home city. Requests for speakers are made through an online form that is accessible through the URL: http://web.ushmm.org/speaker . The Museum also maintains an online form where visitors to the website can sign up to monthly e-newsletters. Requests to sign up for the enewsletter are made through an online form that is accessible through the URL: http://act.ushmm.org/page/s/ushmm3. All data received through the above mentioned web forms are collected into a database currently managed under Kinteras Sphere platform, a hosted service by Blackbaud. Any time one of these three forms are completed by a visitor to the website, the constituent receives a personalized confirmation email about their request. USHMM Staff also receives an email message from Kintera Sphere with the information that was collected on the form from the constituent. With all
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 46 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

of these three forms, the staff can update all the information collected from the forms using Kintera Spheres administrative tool to provide fuller information about the various requests. These updates on the back end include adding additional details about whether or not the request was fulfilled and information about whether the speaker request took place, where it took place, who spoke, etc. Given the description above, the vendors are requested to provide their approach to facilitate these processes so the data can be captured within the CRM system. In addition, please describe your approach to correlate the data with other constituents information within the CRM system to establish relationships. Also please describe the reporting capabilities around such request operations. Vendors are also encouraged to visit the websites referenced above and suggest additional capabilities of their system that are not currently available. FD-8. Collections Donor Information Database USHMMs Collections Office is currently using a management system called EMu, a Windowsbased application using a proprietary database, built by KE Software, running on a RedHat Linux server. One of the features of this system, provided through "Parties" table within the database, enables EMu system to catalog and manage information about the Museums constituents who donated objects, manuscripts, oral histories, photographs, film or video as individuals or organizations. This information includes but not limited to: address, phone number, gender, biography, relationship to item, relationship to other individuals or organizations and aliases. The Collections Office also catalogs and manages information about people who were associated with the items but were not the donor. Again, the information includes relationship to other individuals, biography, gender, aliases and relationship to items. The data is used to create biographies for exhibitions, to help the Curators maintain contact. This information also puts the items in a collection into context (ex. donor was child of the person related to the object) and aids searches for scholars, exhibitions staff and other researchers. USHMM requests the vendor to clearly describe their methodology that will work for EMu to exchange information with their proposed the CRM platform in a bi-directional manner to ensure information is updated regardless of where the changes are made. If there is a change of contact information or status (examples: marital status change, alive vs. deceased, etc.), how would that change made on either EMu or the new CRM system will be reflected on the other system.

FD-9. Museum Programs Tracking The office of National Institute of Holocaust Education (NIHE) currently uses several desktopbased data management systems including Excel spreadsheets and MS-Access databases to manage a variety of programs conducted throughout the year both at the Museum and in various locations across the country. These data sources contain data that are related to the programs the NIHE offers. These databases include the following data: name of program, date of program, location of program, type of activity (museum tour, workshop, orientation, etc.), staff contact for the program, name of partner organization if one, number of participants, who the audience is (military, teachers, youth, etc.). There is no contact information collected in these databases.
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 47 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

Program staff are responsible for entering the information for their program so ease and quickness of entry is extremely important and a top priority. NIHE uses the information in these data sources to create reports on who we serve, where they are from, how they are served, and to quantify our programmatic activities. Many times these reports are in response to a request from senior management or on an annual or periodic basis for donor reports. Please describe your the methodology by which the ability for users to input report parameters through a form and "create" their own reports based on a specific date, type of program, or other criteria will be handled. Also please explain the ease of use of your system for such data entry, management and report generation processes - all of which are important to improve our program management. *** The above summarizes the mandatory and desired functional requirements.

Exhibit III. Reference Architectures In this section, two architectures are provided. A Reference Information Architecture and an As-Is Systems Architecture. The diagram in Figure 1 depicts the Reference Information Architecture and use of standard terminology being established at USHMM with respect to the Museums Programs as well as Fund Raising activities. Vendors are requested to align their responses to this terminology that are pertinent to Fundraising and Program activities to ensure a consistency of understanding in the products and use of their products. This is not meant to be a design architecture as this will depend on the products used in an eventual system. The As-Is Systems Architecture in Figure 2 provides an overview of systems currently in use at USHMM to support fund raising activities. Vendors should use this, in conjunction with the mandatory and desired requirements in Exhibits I and II to ensure like functionality is provided in addition to new functionality as stipulated in the requirements.

Various fundraising systems, applications, services and tools currently being used are presented in the architecture diagram below (Figure 2), identified in some cases by the name(s) of USHMMs most recent service providers (which, as outsourced resources, are always subject to change), followed by a brief explanation of each of the tools and services below the figure:

Figure 2: Functional description/definition of various components of the current or "AS-IS" architecture

1. Fund Raising Systems
1.1 Donors, Prospects, Members, etc. - Tracking & Management 1.1.1 Desktop Applications Major Gift Officers (MGOs) in various field offices as well as at the headquarters in Washington, DC primarily use desktop applications like Microsoft Excel and Access and data from these applications is exchanged with Team Approach (see below), the current constituent management system. These desktop applications, in addition to being used as a constituent management database, are also used track and manage additional functions such as fund raising events as well. 1.1.2 Relational Database for Tracking Donations and Pledges Team Approach is an externally hosted client/server application running on an Oraclebased relational database. It enables management of constituent information and tracking of donations and pledges for major gifts, planned giving and membership.
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 52 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

1.1.3 Mass Mailing L&E Meridian manages Memberships acknowledgement program as well as the payment reminders for the monthly giving program. Acknowledgements mail on a weekly basis and payment reminders mail monthly. The data files are run based on SOP data pull instructions, QCd by the database Account Rep and then posted to L&Es FTP site for processing. 1.1.4 Telemarketing PDR II (formerly Share) manages the telemarketing efforts for Membership. The data files are provided as per instructed for each TM campaign. When the calling has completed, PDR II provides an End of Campaign file that needs to be uploaded into the database. 1.1.5 Direct Mail Production Management Production Solutions (PS) is a direct mail production management company that manages all of Memberships direct mail campaigns. Data selects are submitted to the database company via and final mail files are posted to PSs FTP site. At the end of every direct mail campaign, a file is provided that reflects final mail quantity and expenses that needs to be uploaded into the database. 1.1.6 Merge/Purge Services PIDI (recently bought by Blackbaud) manages the merge/purge process for Memberships acquisition direct mail efforts. This process takes outside lists (rented or exchanged by Membership through their list brokerage company) as well as internal lists of lapsed records and merges them against each other, purging duplicates and providing a final mail file(s). At the end of the campaign, PIDI provides a file that includes mailing information and costs that needs to be loaded into the database. An RFP solicitation for these services is currently occurring. 1.1.7 List Management Brokerage Services The incumbent for these services was Carol Enters List Company (CELCO), who was responsible for requesting data files from the database provider that includes lapsed members (people who have not renewed that we are hoping will rejoin) as well as any modeled files offered for rent. At of the end of February, 2012, USHMM is in the final stages of a resolicitation, which as it turns out will result in these services being fulfilled by a different vendor. As soon as this new contract is awarded, said vendor will take over for CELCO in receiving results from the database to provide analysis of the various lists to determine which were successful and should be used in future efforts. 1.1.8 Credit Card Payments (Monthly Giving) Payment Solutions manages the credit card payments for the monthly giving program. They submit files of payments for loading into the database system. 1.1.9 Membership List Rental/Exchange

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

53 of 75

[CRM Implementation]

USHMM Membership makes available for rent/exchange a list of members. The names available are based on specific criteria provided by the USHMM. The database provides this file to Trylon on a quarterly basis. Trylon is then responsible for fulfilling these requests as needed. 1.1.10 Toll-Free Calling Center MarkeTouch is the Museums in-bound 800 number. They are responsible for providing basic customer service in response to calls and emails from members & donors. The operators at MarkeTouch have access to the database to be able to provide information and answers re: a members account. They also have limited rights to adjust donor records. 1.1.11 E-Commerce & ListServ Kintera Sphere (officially called as Blackbaud Sphere) is currently used for constituent management, fundraising, email communication/marketing and website management for USHMM's online shop and eNewsletter publications. This service is planned to be replaced. Some of the services have been migrated to Blue State Digital (see below) and the others are planned to be migrated to other platforms. 1.1.12 Online Fundraising An online fundraising platform that provides constituents management services, fundraising, email communications/marketing, website management and analytics. This system also handles donations made through USHMMs website, inbound customer service call center (MarketTouch Media) as well as internal Museum processing team. Data from Blue State Digital is exported and fed into Team Approach using an ADU through Agilis, a caging and data entry service provider (see below). BSD also provides strategic consultation, database management, analytics and other client services as they relate to web strategies and integration. 1.1.13 Caging Services Agilis is a caging vendor that provides a variety of services including processing of checks and credit cards. This company also provides additional services such as document processing, scanning and manual database entries of contacts and transactions. Transactions fulfilled by Agilis are asynchronously uploaded to Team Approach on a daily basis. 1.2. Events Registration and Management This function supports the planning and execution of Museum Events, both fund raising and nonfund raising. 1.2.1 Special Events Database An in-house developed database running on Microsoft SQL Server. This application is primarily developed for Days of Remembrance, a major annual event commemorating the events of the Holocaust. 1.2.2 Online Event Registration
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 54 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

A hosted web-based application that provides online registration of events that includes fee-based events as well as non-fee events hosted by USHMM with or without partnership with other organizations. Events participants tracking happens by way of inputting data into the development system, TA, through the caging vendor Agilis (more description about Agilis below in this document). Lack of electronic integration of CVent with anything is an operational challenge. This results in duplicate and out-of-date records with lack of universal access inside and outside of events management, such as with Membership. This results in operational inefficiencies and increased costs. The goal is to have a universal database of events, contacts and interactions with event participants, organizers, and constituents. 1.3. Planned Giving 1.3.1 Planned Giving Application USHMMs planned giving operation currently managed using the application PG Calc. It is a stand-alone desktop application that generates detailed illustrations of the benefits available to a donor or prospects with respect to a wide variety of deferred/planned gifts. For example, if a couple, ages 80 and 85, wanted to establish a charitable gift annuity (CGA) with a $100,000 cash, a PG Calc illustration can be generated. Such an illustration would show the pay out rate, chartiable deduction, taxation and the type of income generated over the course of the CGA. PG Calc is currently used by a few select staff members on their desktops and the benefit illustrations, agreements and other documents generated using PG Calc are either printed or stored on shared network drives for back reference purposes. In other words, the system does not allow interactivity or collaboration among staff. In addition, the financial data for each of the transactions is manually entered into Team Approach for tracking and generating reports. PG Calc does not have automated data connectivity to any other system local or externally hosted. It is anticipated that USHMM would continue to use PGCalc as part of its target architecture therefore any replacement system would need to provide a file transfer interface or an API. Specific requirements for systems listed below are not defined and they are outside of scope of work described in this RFP. These systems, software or services belong in one or more of the following categories: 1. Developed and operated by USHMM, 2. Web-based third party analytical tools, 3. Provide support functions to facilitate fundraising operations, and 4. USHMMs internal financial platform (ERP). 1.4. eGiving Collectively, these services provide additional revenue mechanism for the fund raising operations of USHMM. Currently eGiving is facilitated through the following applications and services: 1.4.1 ushmm.org Online donations are accepted through multiple web pages and forms throughout USHMMs public website. For example, clicking on the link on the Museums home page will take the visitor to the donation page under an USHMM-branded URL: https://donate.ushmm.org/page/contribute/donate. This URL is an alias to Blue State
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 55 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

Digitals system and the donations made are recorded and tracked through the Blue State Digital. There are several forms that collect information into BSDs system -- both fundraising and e-mail capture for engagement. 1.4.2 Telemarketing Services MarketTouch Media is a service provider where people can give gifts through MarkeTouch, but they are an incoming 800# that provides Customer Service. Funds are also raised through phone with MarketTouch Media. Money raised through such telemarketing is entered into Blue State Digital system manually. 1.4.3 Mobile Giving (Applications Service Platform) Mobile Commons is a mobile giving platform and the donations made through this service are fed into USHMMs financial system, PeopleSoft, manually. 1.4.4 Electronic Kiosks Plans are currently underway to install physical kiosks within the Museum building in Washington, DC to collect donations and these kiosks will be web-driven through Blue State Digitals solution. 1.5. Support Tools This function lists a set of tools that support fund raising-related data handling efforts. 1.5.1 FileZilla A secure data transfers tool that employs SFTP protocol. 1.5.2 PGP USHMM uses PGP encryption standards for file exchange operations. 1.5.3 SpiceWorks This is an open source tool with a web front end that functions as a help desk software to manage tasks. 1.5.4 eVision eVision is an image viewer application that works in conjunction with Agilis (see 1.1.13 above). It provides the ability for the staff to visually inspect and verify images associated with any document that is being processed by Agilis like deposit number, name, etc.

2. Research, Analytics and Reporting
This function lists the tools used to provide necessary information and data that serves for more strategic fund raising efforts. 2.1 RP Silver and Wealth Engine

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

56 of 75

[CRM Implementation]

These are wealth indexing online applications used as reference tools. Visualization of data is being facilitated through USHMM-built Data Warehouse (see below for more information about Data Warehouse). 2.2 FYxx Request - Foundation Search and Foundation Center These are search engines focusing on foundations of all levels. They provide information on grants, amounts, interests and other related information. FYxx Request - NOZA Search engine specific to individual charitable giving. In addition, Internet is also being used as a major research tool as well. Web Analytics ABData & Integral work in partnership to provide data analytics services to USHMM using data imported from Team Approach. Daily data imports are done through automated process and used for analytical and reporting purposes. Data Warehouse The USHMM Data Warehouse is a custom built web-based reporting tool built on Microsoft SQL Server. It provides consolidated data analysis and reporting functions that works in conjunction with Team Approach and Peoplesoft. In addition, it also interfaces with other internal applications and provides a comprehensive analytical tool. While data is successfully imported into the current data warehouse for analysis and reporting, the process is mostly asynchronous. A better synchronization through a compatible development system is desired to facilitate data visualization to be more current and up-to-date.

3. Financials
ERP USHMMs enterprise financial system is PeopleSoft. This system facilitates reporting procurements, accounts payable, and general ledger which receives data from various sources including the current donor management system. Data transactions with the USHMMs financial systems still require better automation and synchronization with external data sources. Ideally, a three way interaction among a donor management, financial institutions (banks), and PeopleSoft is highly desirable.

Exhibit IV Scope of Operations Development The Office of Development is a major unit of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum with an annual comprehensive fund raising goal of around $35+ million outright. The staff is made up of about 40 members who are primarily located at the Museum in Washington DC. There are also 6 regional offices: West Coast (Los Angeles), Southwest (Dallas), Southeast (Boca Raton), Mid West (Chicago), Northeast (New York City) and New England (Albany). The fundraising team consists of the Chief Development Officer, Deputy Chief Development Officer, Major Giving Officers, Planned Giving Officers, Stewardship Officers, Operations and support staff. The efforts are also assisted by that of our Museum leadership, Council, Program staff and lay leaders. The financial tracking of donations is segmented by the following: Major Gifts, Planned (Deferred Gifts), and Membership; Annual Fund and Endowment, Restricted and Unrestricted Funds, Pledges and One Time Gifts, Donor Advised Funds, Gift Intents, as well as cost recovery (costs for benefits received). It is a complicated accounting structure that needs a sophisticated donor database system to manage and report on the fundraising financials accurately. See example below where one of the scenarios of complexity associated with the management of gift relationship is illustrated: Entities within Donor Relationships 1) Individual Account 2) Family Member ­ deceased sister of individual account 3) Family Foundation and its President 4) Charitable Trust and its CPA/Financial Advisor (CPAs are also advisors for partners) 5) Individual account holders company and its other partners Gift complexity 1) 1st gift was a corporate gift made by the three partners. Pledge is on Corporate Acct and 3 parties are paying of 1/3 each. They request individual invoices. 2) Foundation makes gifts of which individual is soft credited. 3) Foundation President is recognized at Founders level for Foundation giving but also gives individual gifts personally ­ lower level. 4) Three corporate partners later give a second joint pledge as individuals and not through the corporation. Pledge is all on one of the partners account and others pay it off via third party payments. 5) Son of a partner has made payments on Pledge referred to in #4 on behalf of father. The relationships among the above components and activities are illustrated using an object model below:

USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800

Approximately 10,000 records are considered high-touch for the Development program. Strategies and contacts on these records need to be managed by multiple members of the fundraising team. A user-friendly and intuitive system is needed to ensure effective data entry. As major donors will often give from multiple giving entities, we require a system that can look at a donor/prospect from a micro giving level and also a macro overview. Additionally, easy to use constituency coding, pipeline and stage tracking, and strategic actions with next step ticklers is essential. Finally, a system that can manage the financials from both an accounting as well as a recognition view will also be important. Membership The Membership program has been in existence since 1991 and is an integral part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's fundraising operations and initiatives. It is a mature,
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 59 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

sophisticated direct response fundraising program and is crucial to lead generation for Development efforts. The active Membership file size is approximately 180,000 (0-24 month), with an additional lapsed audience in excess of 650,000. The program is budgeted to raise $9.2 million in gross revenue for fiscal year 2012 (October 1, 2011 ­ September 30, 2012). Membership revenue is primarily generated through direct mail (87%), with a significantly smaller percentage of funds acquired through telemarketing (4%), online (9%) and mobile giving (<1%). Below is a breakdown of the primary fundraising programs that encompass the direct response Membership program utilizing the channels mentioned above:         Renewals (expire-based) Appeals Acquisition Acknowledgements Reinstatements Tributes New Member Welcome Series Monthly Giving Sustainers

The Membership program is dependent on professional services, including an account management team to implement Membership database operations. We do not have expertise or capacity to transfer these in-house and would expect the proposed solutions to incorporate or integrate these existing account management functions:  Provide expertise, consultation and oversight for Membership database management and implementation  Define, manage, and coordinate all database-related processes  Manage all database-related customer requests, inclusive of the file pull segmentation (for example):  Provide counts for each segment as requested prior to creating interactions or sending data file to mail house vendor  Apply interactions to each record selected for solicitations or other mailings, as specified  Populate data files as needed (e.g. acknowledgment date)  Prepare file for FTP transfer  Provide final transmission counts and notification of sent data  Verify receipt of all files to/from the identified supplier/mailing house  Manage coordination with external suppliers regarding data exports & imports  Participate in team meetings and quarterly strategic partner meetings annually  Participate in weekly planning meetings and calls to manage data, oversee business rules, trouble-shoot data issues, provide expertise and knowledge, assure accurate and timely delivery of file specifications, etc
USHMM RFP-9531-12-R-0800 60 of 75 [CRM Implementation]

 Proactively identify efficiencies for segmentation process  Develop a process of standardizing exclude criteria for all marketing efforts  Collaborate on defining roles and hand-off process for defining file segmentation  Work with USHMM team and its partners to identify key quality control and file approval standards  Process interaction codes back to the database to support analytic needs  Manage administration and billing Special Events The Special Events department of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum supports roughly 230 events annually including but not limited to large and small fundraising events, domestic and international conferences; public programs, ceremonies, and educational international donor programs. Special Events is responsible for the logistical support of events at the Museum and throughout the Museums seven regional offices (i.e., DC plus six others) spread across the U.S. and initiatives abroad. Special Events and other Museum departments are in critical need of a highly customizable online registration and client management system that provides a comprehensive database of attendees as well as participants, volunteers, VIPs and staff in order to better serve our constituents, enable us to raise funds, and accurately archive the Museums programs. The goal is to provide a seamless system for registration, financial reporting and reconciliation, and event planning. Below is a breakdown of the Museums annual events that the department supports:  10 Major Fundraising Events (500+ attendees)  20 Private Fundraising Events (30 - 500)  50 Parlour Meetings/Small Fundraising Events  30 Public Programs (100 - 1000)  50 Educational and Scholarly Conferences  55 Leadership Training  5 International Programs  35 Internal Museum Events - prof. development, operational summits, Council meetings  25 Special Programs Programs The Program areas of USHMM consist of the offices of the Center for the Advancement of Holocaust Studies, the National Institute for Holocaust Education, the Committee on Conscience, and Collections. The Programs host numerous national and international events that require online registration and tracking of participants and programs. Many of these events are supported by the Special Events group but many are not. Participants to the programs often go through processes that require routing for selection, administration, tracking, and approval. There is no current system to manage these programs and many are done through a labor intensive paper process. The Museum also receives artifacts and gifts from donors that require tracking to ensure proper recognition of these gifts are made.

 Correspondence with approx. 2,000 program alumni and international institutional partners per year. National Institute for Holocaust Education The role of the National Institute for Holocaust Education (NIHE) within the United States Holocuast Memorial Museum is to create greater educational impact by being the visionary center for the development of all educational activities from exhibitions to Web sites to programs. Key audiences, including youth, teachers, law enforcement and the military, are challenged not just to learn about Holocaust history but to think about its meaning for their own lives. The Institute team, made up of a broad cross-section of Museum staff, integrates and coordinates the Museum's full range of educational activities. The team crafts innovative programs that promote humane values, and motivate individuals to confront the consequences of prejudice, hatred, violence, and genocide. The Museum's exhibition and education programs use innovative multi-media tools, survivor stories, and the dramatic presentation of authentic artifacts to give Museum visitors and program participants a personalized encounter with a historical event of enormous magnitude and its implications. Committee on Conscience The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum formed the Committee on Conscience to "alert the national conscience... to insure that such a totally inhuman assault as the Holocaust ­ or any partial version thereof ­ never recurs." The mission of the Committee on Conscience (CoC) is to stimulate global action to prevent genocide and to catalyze an international response when it occurs. To achieve its ambitious mission, the CoC carries out activities targeting the following audiences: high-level policymakers and societal leaders, national and international government officials, academics and genocide scholars, foreign policy professionals working at non-governmental organizations, educators, students, the general public, and the like. Current outreach activities include:  Providing information and resources about genocide and mass atrocities via email updates. (over 35,000 e-community members); its website; social media tools; and mailing hard copies of DVDs, brochures, and other materials.  Carrying out public events (approximately 3-5/year) and participating in targeted speaking engagements at the Museum or around the country (approximately 20/year).  Hosting conferences and symposium (approximately 3/year) for targeted audiences.  Encouraging all audiences to visit its physical and online exhibition titled, From Memory to Action: Meeting the Challenge of Genocide, and asking these audiences to make pledges to take action to prevent genocide (over 100,000 pledges since opening in 2009). Museum Visitor Operations Annually, the Museum receives about 1.6 million visitors. These visitors are mostly the general public but also include other key constituents whose visit to the Museum need to be tracked and made available to other groups within the Museum.

Current Systems and Technical Environment Relevant platforms currently in use are fully described in Exhibit III to this RFP. As evidenced by the existing architecture diagram in that section, USHMM has a core system that it uses for its Development operations called Blackbauds Team Approach as well as many other databases and spreadsheets used by staff in the Regional Offices. In addition, Membership has a number of systems and external service providers to support its ongoing operations. The Special Events team uses CVent as its primary system but also uses an internally developed database to handle some of it more complex events. The Program areas and Museum operations use a varied set of disparate contacts databases. For instance, the Committee on Conscience uses Kintera Sphere to track and store data on the many resource and speaker requests it receives it each year. The CoC also currently uses Kintera Sphere to store contact information for its constituents who receive a monthly e-community newsletter and occasional news and event updates. The CoC maintains a separate database in Excel to track some of its very important high-level contacts that it reaches out to with very targeted updates. The CoC maintains a separate Google database to keep track of its relationships with its key individual and foundation donors and prospects. USHMM is using Google for its eMail and calendaring functions and also employs Google Docs, Sites, Chat and Groups in addition to Microsoft Office. Microsofts Active Directory provides directory services. USHMM makes use of social media such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter and is in the process of redesigning its external website with deployment planned for 2012. USHMM is interested in further exploiting social media on its eventual CRM platform and integrating with these other applications. The Museum is currently planning Single Sign On using SerureAuth and would expect to also integrate the CRM platform into this as well.

Exhibit V. Preliminary Program Plan USHMM will take a phased approach to fully implementing the CRM and associated capabilities as given in the requirements of Exhibit I and II. USHMM has identified an initial approach to phasing for this program below. This phasing approach is considered preliminary and subject to change as the program evolves. Exhibit VII identifies the current contact data sources of which a subset will be included in Phase I. As indicated in RFP Section L.2 (see, e.g., FAR 52.215-1, Alternate II), the vendor is welcome to propose alternative approaches based on the USHMM requirements and their experience. The scope and approach of Phase I will be finalized during the RFP clarification and discussion process. Phase 1: Architecture, Events Management, Initial Contacts Consolidation  Select an Events Management platform (may be part of CRM). Preference is to extend CRM platform, then have vendor recommend an approach that either leverages CVent or replace it with a third party product that has a proven track record of integration with the CRM platform. Integrate events registration with USHMM web site.  Develop overall information architecture for the CRM and systems architecture for the CRM and all associated systems.  Integrate CRM with email, and calendar in Google and the ushmm.org web site (contact and other non-financial information)  Bidirectional integration with existing data warehouse built on SQL Server  Integrate Events data with Team Approach  Establish a bidirectional interface with Team Approach to transfer contact information  Replace Gift Log with same or better functionality  Migrate and consolidate (de-duplication) a predetermined set of existing contact databases (e.g., MS-Excel & MS-Access in Regional Offices and/or Program databases)  Develop a phased program plan for the overall migration to the CRM from Team Approach  Identify a data migration strategy for Team Approach  Support for Business Process Reengineering, define Key process Areas as well as process mapping.  Provide support with best practices on policies, for both the current phase as well as the next the phase of implementation.  Develop requisite reports for contact and event management. Phase 2:  Prospect Management for Major Gifts and Planned Giving  Capital, Endowment, and/or Comprehensive campaign management  Major Gift Integration with PeopleSoft Financials  Migrate any remaining contact databases as noted in Phase 1  Decommission standalone contact databases other than Team Approach  Integration with Planned Giving and wealth assessment tools as appropriate.

Phase 3: Membership Operations, Analysis, and Management  Marketing campaign management and execution

Exhibit VII: Existing Contacts Data Sources USHMM has identified all contacts data sources currently in use throughout the Museum. This comprehensive inventory is provided in the table below. Eventually, all of these data sources will either be subsumed by the CRM platform or, if necessary, interface in a synchronous way, with the CRM platform. In the first phase of the CRM project, a subset of these databases has been tentatively identified for replacement (highlighted in yellow) or interface with the CRM platform (highlighted in green). All other data sources are currently not applicable for Phase 1. Please note: Any specific action on any of the identified data sources will be determined as part of the finalization of the Phase 1 project scope definition.

A static table is used as a search table. The table contains data directly from Team Approach and it is used to quickly dump demographic data into a contact table when the TA number of the donor being entered matches the TA number of the donor in the static search table. A link in the form allows for quick access to live TA data for comparison and updating new information.

Record, track and report all gifts, reservations and seating preferences for the Chicago Luncheon. The system is split into two linked databases. One houses all of the raw data and the other house all of the forms, queries, modules/code and reports needed to manage the data.

I use this database to keep track of our region's donors, donations and events. I use it to write and keep track of thank you letters, seating charts and statistics for events. I also use it to keep our filing cabinets organized by keeping track on who has a file folder and by printing out labels for those that need them.

This is a database that I created from scratch and it is invaluable to my position. Since I am not allowed to N/A use Team Approach to it's fullest capabilities, I use this DB instead.

Exhibit VII: Existing Contacts Data Sources


USHMM has identified all contacts data sources currently in use throughout the Museum. This comprehensive inventory is provided in the table below. Eventually, all of these data sources will either be subsumed by the CRM platform or, if necessary, interface in a synchronous way, with the CRM platform. In the first phase of the CRM project, a subset of these databases has been tentatively identified for replacement (highlighted in yellow) or interface with the CRM platform (highlighted in green).  All other data sources are currently not applicable for Phase 1.  Please note: Any specific action on any of the identified data sources will be determined as part of the finalization of the Phase 1 project scope definition.
