1.0 GENERAL

1.1 Scope

The intention of this requirement is the acquisition of a Learning Content Management System (LCMS) and services to support the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)/National Preparedness Directorate/National Training and Education Directorate (NTED)/Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) located in Anniston, Alabama. The contractor shall provide all services as identified in this performance work statement. The Government intends to achieve its goal of an enterprise-wide FEMA LCMS through an incremental acquisition of content authoring licenses and accompanying training, support and maintenance, a process that will initiate at the CDP. The FEMA Emergency Management Institute (EMI) and NTED will purchase content authoring licenses and associated support as an incremental acquisition under this contract. The CDP develops and delivers specialized, advanced hands-on training for emergency response providers from state, local, and tribal governments; and, when appropriate, the Federal Government, foreign governments, and private entities. The objective of this procurement is to obtain reliable, efficient and effective services by applying a sound management and technical approach that will provide the best value and meet the objectives described in this work statement.  



Performance of work shall be conducted within CDP, located on the former Fort McClellan property in Anniston, AL. and contractor’s location.   



1.2 Background 

The CDP is a federal entity (a component of the Department of Homeland Security). On March 1, 2003 CDP transitioned from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).   CDP was subsequently included in the new DHS Preparedness Directorate. Enactment of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) on April 1, 2007 resulted in the realignment of most of the DHS Preparedness Directorate functions to FEMA.  FEMA established the National Preparedness Directorate (NPD) and aligned many of the former DHS Preparedness Directorate functions into the NPD including the CDP. 



The CDP is a national training facility located in Anniston, Alabama that prepares state, local and tribal emergency response personnel to respond to all hazards, including terrorist attacks using weapons of mass destruction, by providing advanced, hands on training. This national training program was developed for state, local, tribal, Federal, private sector and international responders from Fire Service, Law Enforcement, Emergency Medical Services, Emergency Management, HazMat, Public Health, Healthcare, Public Communications, Public Works and Government Administrative and other emergency response personnel, their trainers and supervisors.  Training courses provided by the CDP provide specific knowledge and expertise for deterrence, prevention, response, mitigation and recovery to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) incidents; mass casualty incidents; and incidents involving hazardous materials by providing advanced, hands-on and classroom-based state of the art training.

NOTICE OF FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY PROTESTS


   A. Preface

   Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties must use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party. FEMA
offers, as an option for dispute resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). ADR in an informal, expeditious and inexpensive way to
resolve contract issues and is designed to promote satisfying solutions and fair procedures. For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please
contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address:

   Federal Emergency Management Agency
   Attn: Office of ADR
   395 E Street, SW
   Patriots Plaza 1, Room 525
   Washington, DC 20472-3215

   If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency.

   These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process
outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an
agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is
pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest.

   Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO.

   These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103.

   B. Definitions.

     (1) "Agency protest," as used in this Synopsis/Solicitation, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer
responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer.

     (2) "Ombudsman," as used in this Synopsis/Solicitation, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the
Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest.  Protesters using these
procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman.

     (3) "Day," as used in this Synopsis/Solicitation, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the
day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period
extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday.  Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for
all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open.

   C. Submission Guidelines.

     (1) Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman
either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows:

       a. Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed or faxed to:

   Gary P. Topper,
   Department of Homeland Security/FEMA
   Acquisition Preparedness Branch
   Building D
   16825 South Seton Avenue
   Emmitsburg, MD 21727

   -OR-

   DHS/FEMA
   Att: Anthony Martoccia
   Acquisition Operations Division
   395 E Street, SW, Room 526
   Washington, DC 20472-3215

       b. The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest".

       c. If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the
protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail"
(Return Receipt Requested).

     (2) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received
after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day.

     (3) Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided:

       a. the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number;

       b. the solicitation or contract number;

       c. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced;

       d. copies of relevant documents;

       e. a request for ruling by the agency;

       f. a statement detailing the form of relief requested;

       g. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and

       h. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.

     (4) All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the
Ombudsman.

   D. Timeliness/Resolution of Protests.

     (1) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of
initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are
requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation
must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation.

     (2) Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is
known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of
competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis
which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the
debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.

     (3) Protests filed through the Contracting Officer.

       a. Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling
and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)".

       b. Appeals

         i. Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's
written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman.

         ii. Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt
Requested).

         iii. The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail
(Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision.

         iv. In accordance with FAR 33.103(d)(4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a)(3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's
decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten
(10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.

     (4) Protests filed through the Ombudsman:

       a. If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons
supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed.

       b. Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency.

   E. Dismissal of Protests.

   The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level;
and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are
procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails to clearly state legally sufficient grounds of
protest).

     2. The proposal shall be prepared in two (2) parts:  a "Technical Proposal” and “Business Proposal".  Each of the parts shall be separate
and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently from evaluation of the other. The technical proposal (Volume
1) must not contain reference to price; however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials,
subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the performance work statement may be
evaluated.


      The two parts shall be organized as follows:


      Volume 1: Technical Proposal


      Section 1 Work Plan
      Section 2 Management Plan
      Section 3 Staffing Plan & Key Personnel
      Section 4 Experience
      Section 5 Past Performance


      Volume 1, Technical Proposal Sections 1 through 3, is limited to 50 single sided total pages.  Double sided pages will count against the 50
      page limit as two pages for each double sided page.


      Resumes of proposed key personnel (limited to 3 pages each) under section 3, the experience (limited to 5 pages each) under section 4, and
      past performance (limited to 5 pages each) under section 5 will not be counted towards the 50 page limitation of the Technical Proposal.
      Pages submitted in excess of the limitations specified above may not be evaluated by the Government.


      Volume 2, Business Proposal, has no page limit and shall include: 1) fixed price, as set forth in the CLIN structure under Section
      Price/Cost Schedule above,  2) a copy of the offeror’s Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors (FAR 52.212-3), 3)
      evidence of responsibility, 4) letters of commitment (key personnel and subcontractors), 5) information to support consent to
      subcontractors, and 6) Small Business Participation and Subcontracting Plan.


      All of the above business proposal information must be provided to be considered for contract award.

      Each volume shall be marked with proposal number, title and Offeror's name. Pages shall be numbered. Front matter (title pages, tables of
      contents, cross-reference matrices, acronym lists, and glossaries) may be provided solely for the purpose of easing evaluation.  The
      typewritten or printed letters shall be no smaller than Courier 12 point or equivalent as the minimum size standard, with no reduction
      permitted except organization charts or other graphic illustrations; in those instances where reduction is allowable (no smaller than 10
      point recommended).  Offerors shall ensure that the print is easily readable. Each page shall have not less than one-inch margins on each
      side of the page. Header/footer information (which does not include any information to be evaluated) may be included in the 1” margin
      space. Each 8 and 1/2 by 11 inch “sheet” shall count as one page. Foldouts for complete spreadsheets and/or organization charts are
      permissible up to 11" by 17" and shall count as two pages.


     3.  Amendments to Proposal - Any changes to a proposal made by the offeror after its initial submittal (i.e., in the final revised
proposal) shall be accomplished by replacement pages.  Changes from the original page shall be indicated on the outside margin by vertical lines
adjacent to the change.  The offeror shall include the date of the amendment on the lower right corner of the changed pages.


     4. The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in Evaluation Factors for Award section of
this combined synopsis/solicitation. Failure to respond or follow the instructions regarding the organization and content of the Technical and
the Business Proposals may result in the Offeror's proposal being removed from further consideration.
