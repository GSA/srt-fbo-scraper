2.  Contract Title.  Global Information Grid (GIG) Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Services and Network Architecture

3.  Background.  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) has a principal mission to provide
architectural, systems engineering, and analytical support to the Department of Defense (DoD) Global Information Grid (GIG) development in
support of warfighter mission requirements. This supporting role is particularly critical in the context of the current transformation towards
net-centric warfare and net-centric operations undertaken by the DoD. DISA EWSE provides this support to programs and initiatives focused on
solving high-priority technical issues that can affect end-to-end interoperability and performance across the GIG programs.  DoD IPv6
implementation and transition is one of such EWSE technical issues.


DoD’s GIG transport network has been evolving into a set of converged IP networks with a Secure Federated Backbone (SFB) network interconnecting
all the DoD enclave networks ranging from the fixed Base/Camp/Post/Station (B/C/P/S) user networks to the deployed mobile tactical networks. The
current GIG IP networks use IP version 4 (IPv4) technologies like the Internet. Back in 1990s, a newer version of the Internet Protocol, i.e.,
IP version 6 (IPv6), was designed to primarily address the space exhaustion problem of IPv4 as a result of exponential growth of the Internet.
The IPv6 specification introduces major modifications and enhancement. Among them are larger address space, better E2E security, integrated
support for IP mobility, and flexible Quality of Service (QoS), etc. and IPv6 is technically incompatible with IPv4.  Due to the deployment of
some mitigation approach such as NAT and private address space in IPv4, high cost of IPv6 implementation, and lack of true killer applications,
IPv6 network and service infrastructure deployment have been mostly in experiment stage in the past decade for the service providers and large
enterprises.


Following the industry trend, DoD began the planning for the transition to IPv6 in 2003 when the DoD CIO issued its first IPv6 mandate
requirement memo.  Since then DoD has been preparing for the transition by acquiring IT network products that are IPv6 capable, conducting pilot
vendor IPv6 product and network testing, and defining the IA requirements. As part of those study and experiment efforts for IPv6 transition,
DoD has determined IPv4/IPv6 dual stack architecture to be the overarching technical strategy and baseline architecture for transitioning to and
proving support for IPv6. Both DoD and MILDEPs have developed their high-level IPv6 transition plan. The DoD IPv6 address plan was also
developed. However, there does not exists a  set of DoD enterprise level technical documents that provide detailed IPv6 requirements, network
architecture, networking service infrastructure, standards profile and technical guidance required for incremental implementation and transition
to IPv6 within the DoD. These technical documents are essential to ensure IPv6 E2E interoperability and performance across the GIG. With most
recent Federal OMB and DoD IPv6 mandate and directives in 2010 requiring phased IPv6 transition, there is an urgent and practical need to
develop those enterprise level technical requirments, architecture, standards profile and guidance to support interoperable IPv6 implementation
and smooth transition within DoD.


DoD IPv6 transition will be non-trivial considering sheer scale and complexity of the GIG networks. It’s indispensible to document the existing
IPv6 technical requirements and analyze the current high-level IPv6 transition plans developed by DoD and MIILDEPs, and develop detailed DoD
IPv6 network architecture, service infrastructure, standards profile, engineering design and implementation guidance based on the dual-stack
model across both strategic and tactical networks. During the transition, IPv4 only, IPv6 only and dual stack network islands will co-exist
within GIG and complex permutation of interconnection among those network types need to be analyzed and addressed. As part of the Ipv6
requirements and architecture products, IPv6 intra-inter-domain routing architecture for both unicast and multicast, Virtual Private network
(VPN) and Quality of Service (QoS) architectures,  network management,  and information assurance (IA) infrastructure need to be developed as
well, which should be interoperable with the existing IPv4 architectures for those functions.  This task will only focus on the IPv6 transition
of the GIG networks and associated service infrastructure, the IPv6 transition requirements for applications will be addressed in a separate
task. A realistic and efficient transition plan and architecture design need to be developed for incremental implementation of the IPv6 networks
across the GIG.

In the past, DISA EWSE has led the GIG community to develop enterprise interoperability architecture for both the GIG IP network and value-added
service networks, including GIG Secure Federated Backbone (SFB) network architecture, GIG IP inter-domain routing architecture, GIG network QoS
architecture, GIG IP multicast architecture and GIG VPN architecture. The developed IPv6 architecture should be consistent and interoperable
with those architectures.

4.  Objectives:  The objectives of this requirement are to: 1)  Analyze the current state and requirements of DoD networks, systems, and
services in transitioning to IPv6; 2) Document commercial and government IPv6 transition and implementation best practice and industry

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.203-2     CERTIFICATE OF INDEPENDENT PRICE DETERMINATION (APR 1985)

(i) Those prices,

(ii) The intention to submit an offer, or

(a) Definition. Women-owned business concern, as used in this provision, means a concern that is at least 51 percent owned by one or more women;
or in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of its stock is owned by one or more women; and whose management and daily
business operations are controlled by one or more women.

in paragraph (b)(1) of FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations, of this solicitation.] The offeror represents that it (  ) is a
women-owned business concern.

(End of provision)



52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)

-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor

2.2  Table of Contents

Include a master table of contents of the entire proposal.


3.0   Volume II – Technical/Management Volume



3.1 General

The Technical/Management Volume should be specific and complete.  Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important.  Your responses will be
evaluated against the technical/management subfactors defined in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award.  Using the instructions provided
below, provide as specifically as possible the actual methodology you would use for accomplishing/satisfying these subfactors.  All the
requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory.  By your proposal submission, you are representing that your firm will perform all the
requirements specified in the solicitation. It is not necessary or desirable for you to tell us so in your proposal.  Do not merely reiterate
the objectives or reformulate the requirements specified in the solicitation.


3.2 Format and Specific Content



3.2.1 Technical/Management

In the Technical/Management volume, address your proposed approach to meeting or exceeding the minimum performance or capability requirements of
each technical/management subfactor, as well as the risks in your proposed approach in terms of technical/performance, cost, and/or schedule.


3.2.1.1 Technical/Management Risk

Address technical/management risk by identifying those aspects of the proposal you consider to have the potential for disruption of schedule,
increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and/or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.
Classify each risk in accordance with the DoD Source Selection Procedures.  Provide the rationale for each risk and its rating, including
quantitative estimates of the impact on cost, schedule, and performance.  Describe the impact of each identified risk in terms of its potential
to interfere with or prevent the successful accomplishment of other contract requirements (e.g.,  SOW or specification requirements), whether or
not those requirements are identified as subfactors.  Propose a realistic "work-around" or risk mitigators for identified risks that will
eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.  Identify and classify any new risks introduced by such risk mitigation.


3.2.2 Volume Organization

The Technical/Management volume shall be organized according to the following general outline:
        1) Table of Contents
        2) List of Table and Drawings

        5) Subfactor 1-1: Technical
        6) Subfactor 1-2: Technical
        7) Subfactor 1-3: Management Plan


3.2.3 Subfactor

1)  Technical:  Ability to clearly describe the technical approach to accomplishing this task based on a well-defined systems engineering
process. This shall include the ability to demonstrate a plan to fully meet or exceed the tasks defined in 6.3 and 6.4 of the PWS beyond
compliance statements and to demonstrate contractor’s clear understanding of the requirements and scope of the tasks, potential issues related
to the end-to-end interoperability, and the benefits of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using SysML.

2)  Technical:  Ability to clearly articulate vendor’s proposed detailed technical methods to develop GIG IPv6 services and network
architectures that are reliable, scalable and incrementally implementable in DoD environment.  The contractor shall demonstrate a plan and
ability to fully meet or exceed the required knowledge and experiences related to IPv4/v6 network design and architecture, IP routing, QoS, VPN,
IPv6 network management in large enterprise and/or commercial service provider environment  as required for the solution development of this
task. The contractor shall demonstrate its clear appreciation of the challenges of the technical issues related to E2E interoperability related
to dual-stack based IPv4/IPv6 service network design, transition, and service and network management. Vendor’s strong knowledge of the DoD
networks (both strategically and tactical), and real-world SysML product development experience and capabilities will be favorably considered in
the evaluation.

 3) Management:  The contractor demonstrates a comprehensive management approach that ensures top-quality personnel or are provided to meet all
requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The proposal must provide a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) which demonstrates the right
mix of skill  resources to meet the requirements of the PWS. The resumes of all proposed key personnel shall be provided for government’s
review.  The proposed approach should also address the associated risks with the proposed WBS activities and corresponding mitigation plan when
applicable


4.0 Volume III - Past Performance



4.1 General

Each offeror shall submit a past performance volume with its proposal, including up to three contracts within the past three years that are
similar in nature, complexity, and size to this requirement keeping in mind that more relevant data will be rated higher. The page limit for the
past performance proposals is 2 pages per reference.  For each contract listed, include the following information:
    a. Name of Project
    b. Brief Description of project
    c. Contract or project number
    d. Contract Type
    e. Client/Customer Point of Contact (name, address, phone number, e-mail address)
    f. Dollar/Ceiling value of the contract/project
    g. Period of performance of the contract/project
    h. Relevance of contract/project to requirements of this anticipated effort
    i. Total number and magnitude of task orders (dollar value, duration, etc) awarded to you under the contract
    j. Total number (delineated by business size) of subcontractors/team members managed by you under the contract.

Along with the information required in this paragraph, the offeror shall submit a consent letter executed by each subcontractor, teaming
partner, and/or joint venture partner, authorizing release of past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to such
information.


4.2 Relevant Contracts


Submit information in accordance with Attachment 1:  Past Performance Information on 3  (insert desired numbrecent contracts that you consider
most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort.  Recent is considered to be ongoing contracts or those completed
within three years of the date of issuance of the solicitation.    Re   Also include information on 3 (insert desired number) recent contracts
performed by each of your teaming partners and significant subcontractors that you consider most relevant in demonstrating their ability to
perform the proposed effort.  Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance.  For a description of the characteristics or aspects the
Government will consider in determining recency and relevance, see Section M, provision M002 - Evaluation Factors, paragraph M002c - Past
Performance Factor.


4.2.1 Specific Content

Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed
effort they relate.  This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as
well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a limited or no confidence
rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to
overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the
effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  This may allow the offeror to be considered a higher
confidence candidate.  For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an
offeror has overcome past problems is required.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific technical/management subfactors and
cost/price factor used to evaluate the proposal.




4.2.2 Organizational Structure Change History

Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups,
subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between
conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is
relevant to this procurement.  To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such
changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of
this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment.
 Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offerors, your
"roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government
receives information from other sources.




5.0 Volume IV - Cost/Price



5.1 General Instructions



5.1.1 Cost/Price Reasonableness

This section is to assist you in submitting information other than cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness of your
proposed cost/price.  Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal.  Note that
unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition
either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced
pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror’s proposal.  Offers should be sufficiently
detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed costs/prices rests with the offeror.


5.1.2 Cost/Price Information

Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your
cost/price position.  All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation, must be included in the
section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price volume.  Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included
elsewhere in the proposal.


5.1.3 Cost or Pricing Information Requirements

In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support price
reasonableness.  Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5.  If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is
insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the offeror may be
required to submit certified cost or pricing data.


5.2 Volume Organization

The Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections:
      SECTION 1 - Table of Contents;
      SECTION 2 - Cost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology.
      SECTION 3 – Pricing Tables

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

SECTION M

                                                                    SECTION M

Evaluation Factors for Award




M001 SOURCE SELECTION



a. Basis for Contract Award

This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented
by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the DISA Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DARS).  These regulations are
available electronically at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.asp and http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  The Government will select the best overall
offer, based upon an integrated assessment of technical/management, past performance, and cost/price.  Contracts may be awarded to the offeror
who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation’s requirements (to include
all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is
judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the
offeror who gives DISA the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements.  This may result in an award to a higher
rated and/or higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors.  As long as the Source Selection Authority
(SSA) reasonably determines that the higher ranked technical/management, overall business approach, and/or greater past performance of the
higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals
against all source selection criteria in the solicitation (described below).


b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded

The Government intends to award up to one contract for DISA EE; however, the Government reserves the right to make no award at all. The offeror
is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion.


c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers

The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions, or
unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of
competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.


d. Correction Potential of Proposals

The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency or weakness.  The judgment of such
"correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an offeror's proposal does not meet the Government's
requirements and is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.


e. Competitive Advantage from Use of GFP.

(If applicable, include this paragraph and explain what method or process the Government will use to evaluate GFP value and eliminate any
competitive advantage.  FAR 45.2 covers several different methods to evaluate the impact of GFP.)
The Government will eliminate any competitive advantage resulting from an offeror's proposed use of Government-furnished property (GFP).


M002 EVALUATION FACTORS

(List factors and subfactors and state their order of importance.  Tailor the evaluation factors and subfactors and their order of importance to
your procurement.  The important thing to do is specify order of importance down to the last level of indenture.  The relative order of
importance of the factors should also address whether technical/management, cost/price risk, and past performance are individually more
important, equal to, or less important than cost/price as well as how they relate to cost/price when combined, as required by FAR 15.304(d) and
(e).)


a.  Evaluation Factors and Subfactors

(1)  The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal: Award will be made to the offeror proposing the
combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described below.
The evaluation factors are listed (equal, or specify and list in descending order of importance) in order of importance.  Within the
technical/management factor, all subfactors are equal in importance.
      Factor 1: Technical/Management

           Subfactor 1: Technical:  Ability to clearly describe the technical approach to accomplishing this task based on a well-defined
           systems engineering process. This shall include the ability to demonstrate a plan to fully meet or exceed the tasks defined in 6.3
           and 6.4of the PWS beyond compliance statements and to demonstrate contractor’s clear understanding of the requirements and scope of
           the tasks, potential issues related to the end-to-end interoperability, and the benefits of model-based systems engineering (MBSE)
           using SysML.
           Subfactor 2: Technical:  Ability to clearly articulate vendor’s proposed detailed technical methods to develop GIG IPv6 services and
           network architectures that are reliable, scalable and incrementally implementable in DoD environment.  The contractor shall
           demonstrate a plan and abilities to fully meet or exceed the required knowledge and experiences related to IPv4/v6 network design and
           architecture, IP routing, QoS, VPN, IPv6 network management in large enterprise and/or commercial service provider environment  as
           required for the solution development of this task. The contractor shall demonstrate its clear appreciation of the challenges of the
           technical issues related to E2E interoperability related to dual-stack based IPv4/IPv6 service network design, transition, and
           service and network management. Vendor’s strong knowledge of the DoD networks (both strategically and tactical) and real-world SysML
           product development experience and capabilities will be favorably considered in the evaluation.
           Subfactor 3: Management:  The contractor demonstrates a comprehensive management approach that ensures top-quality personnel or are
           provided to meet all requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The proposal must provide a Work Breakdown Structure
           (WBS) which demonstrates the right mix of skill  resources to meet the requirements of the PWS. The resumes of all proposed key
           personnel shall be provided for government’s review The proposed approach should also address the associated risks with the proposed
           WBS activities and corresponding mitigation plan when applicable.
      Factor 2: Past Performance


           The Contractor shall demonstrate satisfactory recent and relevant past performance on efforts of similar size, scope and complexity
           to the tasks outlined in the performance work statement (PWS), as well as their ability to stay on schedule and on-time delivery of
           the products and within contract cost/price.The Contractor shall demonstrate relevant past performance and experiences in enterprise-
           wide systems engineering (EWSE), specifically experience in the area of interoperability analysis and technical solution architecture
           development in government and large enterprise environment. Knowledge and experience of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), and
           SysML based enterprise architecture product development will be favorably considered.  The proposal shall also demonstrate experience
           in end-to-end analytics to create an effective and integrated information sharing environment.


      Factor 3: Cost/Price


            The estimated amount of dollars available for this acquisition is $850,000.00.



            (2) Relative Importance of Factors and Subfactors.  The relative importance of each factor and subfactor is as follows:  technical,
past performance and cost/price are listed in descending order of importance.  Within the technical/management factor, all subfactors are equal
in importance.





In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are more important than cost or price.

      or


(The following paragraphs (b. technical/management factor) describe each of the evaluation factors.  Tailor these to meet the requirements of
your solicitation, including reordering the paragraphs to reflect the relative order of importance of the factors.)


b. Technical/Management Factor

The technical/management evaluation provides for two distinct but related assessments:  the technical/management rating and the
technical/management risk rating.

(1) Technical/Management Rating.  The technical/management rating provides an assessment of the offeror’s capability to satisfy the Government’s
requirements.  Each technical/management subfactor will receive one of the color ratings described in the DOD Source Selection Procedures,
paragraph 3.1.2.2.1, Table 2 – Technical Ratings, excerpted below.


They focus on the strengths, deficiencies, and weaknesses of the offeror's proposal.  The color rating depicts how well the offeror’s proposal
meets the technical/management subfactor requirements.  Subfactor ratings shall not be rolled up into an overall color rating for the
technical/management factor.


           |Table 2. Technical Ratings                                                                                                                    |
|Color                  |Rating                   |Description                                                                                |
|Blue                   |Outstanding              |Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the |
|                       |                         |requirements.  The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies.               |
|Purple                 |Good                     |Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the     |
|                       |                         |requirements.  Proposal contains at least one strength and no deficiencies.                |
|Green                  |Acceptable               |Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the    |
|                       |                         |requirements.  Proposal has no strengths or deficiencies.                                  |
|Yellow                 |Marginal                 |Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach  |
|                       |                         |and understanding of the requirements.                                                     |
|Red                    |Unacceptable             |Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies and is           |
|                       |                         |unawardable.                                                                               |




 (This paragraph meets the requirements of FAR 15.304(c)(4) and 19.1202)
 (This paragraph meets the requirement of DFARS 215.304 and FAR 15.304(c)(5))
 (You must also describe how you will evaluate the tradeoff (e.g., what other factors or subfactors will be considered and their relative
importance between the evaluation factors/subfactors.  It is mandatory to state in the solicitation how the tradeoffs will be evaluated.)

(When a strength is identified and a Green or Blue technical rating may be warranted, the Green or Blue rating is earned based upon the
magnitude of the additional benefits to the Government associated with the strength.  The mere existence of a single strength does not
necessarily merit a Blue rating, though a Blue rating may be warranted should that strength provide considerable benefit to the Government.
Conversely, a number of strengths may not merit a Blue rating if the collective benefit is relatively minor.)

 (2) Technical/Management Risk Rating.  The Technical/Management Risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed
approach and includes an assessment of the potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance, the need for
increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.

The technical/management subfactors will receive one of the risk ratings described in the DOD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.2.2.2,
Table 3 – Technical Risk Ratings, excerpted below.  They focus on the risks, i.e., weaknesses and significant weaknesses, of the offeror’s
proposed approach to each of the technical/management subfactors.  For any weakness identified, the evaluation shall address the offeror's
proposed mitigation and why that mitigation approach is or is not manageable.

|Table 3. Technical Risk Ratings                                                                                                           |
|Rating                     |Description                                                                                                  |
|Low                        |Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.  Normal  |
|                           |contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties.         |
|Moderate                   |Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.  Special         |
|                           |contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties.            |
|High                       |Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.  Is     |
|                           |unlikely to overcome any difficulties, even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.|




c.  Past Performance Factor

The past performance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror’s ability to supply products and
services that meet users’ needs, based on a demonstrated record of performance.  Performance confidence is assessed at the overall past
performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror’s recent past performance.

Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past
Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic
Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials;
and the Defense Contract Management Agency.

Pursuant to FAR 15.305(a)(2)(v), the assessment will consider the extent to which the offeror’s evaluated past performance demonstrates
compliance with subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, monetary targets for SDB participation, and
notifications submitted under FAR 52.219-25, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program—Disadvantaged Status and Reporting.    Pursuant
to DFARS 215.305(a)(2), the assessment will also consider the extent to which the offeror’s evaluated past performance demonstrates compliance
with FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

   1)  Recency Assessment
An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must
have been performed during the past 3 years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this
condition will not be evaluated.  If any part of the performance falls within the above timeframe, the contract in its entirety may be evaluated
for past performance.   


      (2) Relevancy Assessment
The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained.  For each recent past performance reference
reviewed, the relevance of the work performed will generally be assessed for the technical/management factor and cost/price factor (however, all
aspects of performance that relate to this procurement may be considered).  Consideration will be given to contracts with similarity of
service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s past
performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be
given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed
and evaluated.  The past performance information forms and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of
relevancy of past performance.  The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts (DoD Source
Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1, Table 4):

|Table 4.  Past Performance Relevancy Ratings                                                                                                |
|Rating                                           |Definition                                                                                |
|VERY RELEVANT                                    |Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of      |
|                                                 |effort and complexities this solicitation requires.                                       |
|RELEVANT                                         |Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and        |
|                                                 |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                  |
|SOMEWHAT RELEVANT                                |Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and    |
|                                                 |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                  |
|NOT RELEVANT                                     |Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of     |
|                                                 |effort and complexities this solicitation requires.                                       |


      (3) Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the contract.)
The Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts.  For each recent/relevant past performance reference
reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the technical/management factor and cost/price factor (however, all
aspects of performance that relate to this procurement may be considered).  The quality assessment consists of an in-depth evaluation of the
past performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government customers and fee determining officials, and if
applicable, commercial clients.  It may include interviews with DCMA officials or other sources known to the Government.  Pursuant to FAR
15.305(a)(2)(v), the assessment will consider the extent to which the offeror’s evaluated past performance demonstrates compliance with
subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, monetary targets for SDB participation, and notifications submitted
under FAR 52.219-25, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program—Disadvantaged Status and Reporting.    Pursuant to DFARS 215.305(a)(2),
the assessment will also consider the extent to which the offeror’s evaluated past performance demonstrates compliance with FAR 52.219-8,
Utilization of Small Business Concerns and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings.  Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports a less than
satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system.  For adverse
information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problems, mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of
corrective actions that have resulted in sustained improvements.  Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable
improvements in performance have been demonstrated.


The Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of relevant contracts (DISA Supplemental Source Selection
Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 (S-90), Table 4.5):

|Table 4.5       Past Performance Quality Assessment                                                                                         |

|                                                 |the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for    |
|                                                 |which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.                   |

|                                                 |assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified       |
|                                                 |corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or |
|                                                 |were not fully implemented.                                                               |

(4) Assigning Performance Confidence Assessment.  As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated,
offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating.  The resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at
the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance.  Offerors without a record of relevant past
performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably
assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for
the past performance factor.

More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than a less recent or relevant effort.
A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating.
Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant
record of favorable performance.
(2)

The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in the DoD Source Selection Procedures,
paragraph 3.1.3.3, Table 5 – Performance Confidence Assessments, excerpted below.

|TABLE 5- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS                                                                                                    |
|Rating                                      |Description                                                                                      |
|SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE                      |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation |
|                                            |that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                  |
|SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE                     |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable       |
|                                            |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                      |
|                                            |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation  |
|LIMITED CONFIDENCE                          |that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                  |
|NO                                          | Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation    |
|CONFIDENCE                                  |that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                       |
|UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE                          |No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror’s performance record is so     |
|(Neutral)                                   |sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.               |


e. Cost or Price Factor

(1) The offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed for basic requirements (basic
award) and all options.

      (2) Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.

      (3) The offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine
if it is reasonable, realistic, and complete.  For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person
would pay in the conduct of competitive business.  Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and price analysis techniques as
described in FAR 15.404.  For additional information see FAR 31.201-3.

      (4)  (Use this subparagraph only if budgetary information is included in the solicitation.)  The Government will evaluate the affordability
of each offeror’s cost/price proposal by comparing the total proposed price (or for FPI contracts the maximum contract Government liability) to
the budgetary information included in the solicitation.  The estimated amount of dollars available for this acquisition is $850,000.00.  The
evaluation shall be made on the basis of a separate comparison for each fiscal year of the contract as well as a comparison between the total
price (or proposed maximum contract Government liability) and the total budgetary information included in the solicitation.



f. Discussions

If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to
Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision.

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

      See Sec M.

The relative importance of each factor and subfactor is as follows:  technical, past performance and cost/price are listed in descending order
of importance.  Within the technical/management factor, all subfactors are equal in importance.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than cost/price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

presented here shall not be considered as meeting the requirements for any portions of other volumes of the proposal.


2.2  Table of Contents

Include a master table of contents of the entire proposal.


3.0   Volume II – Technical/Management Volume



3.1 General

The Technical/Management Volume should be specific and complete.  Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important.  Your responses will be
evaluated against the technical/management subfactors defined in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award.  Using the instructions provided
below, provide as specifically as possible the actual methodology you would use for accomplishing/satisfying these subfactors.  All the
requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory.  By your proposal submission, you are representing that your firm will perform all the
requirements specified in the solicitation. It is not necessary or desirable for you to tell us so in your proposal.  Do not merely reiterate
the objectives or reformulate the requirements specified in the solicitation.


3.2 Format and Specific Content



3.2.1 Technical/Management

In the Technical/Management volume, address your proposed approach to meeting or exceeding the minimum performance or capability requirements of
each technical/management subfactor, as well as the risks in your proposed approach in terms of technical/performance, cost, and/or schedule.


3.2.1.1 Technical/Management Risk

Address technical/management risk by identifying those aspects of the proposal you consider to have the potential for disruption of schedule,
increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and/or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.
Classify each risk in accordance with the DoD Source Selection Procedures.  Provide the rationale for each risk and its rating, including
quantitative estimates of the impact on cost, schedule, and performance.  Describe the impact of each identified risk in terms of its potential
to interfere with or prevent the successful accomplishment of other contract requirements (e.g.,  SOW or specification requirements), whether or
not those requirements are identified as subfactors.  Propose a realistic "work-around" or risk mitigators for identified risks that will
eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.  Identify and classify any new risks introduced by such risk mitigation.


3.2.2 Volume Organization

The Technical/Management volume shall be organized according to the following general outline:
        1) Table of Contents
        2) List of Table and Drawings
        3) Glossary
        4) Section 1: Technical/Management Factor

        7) Subfactor 1-3: Management Plan


3.2.3 Subfactor

1)  Technical:  Ability to clearly describe the technical approach to accomplishing this task based on a well-defined systems engineering
process. This shall include the ability to demonstrate a plan to fully meet or exceed the tasks defined in 6.3 and 6.4 of the PWS beyond
compliance statements and to demonstrate contractor’s clear understanding of the requirements and scope of the tasks, potential issues related
to the end-to-end interoperability, and the benefits of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using SysML.

2)  Technical:  Ability to clearly articulate vendor’s proposed detailed technical methods to develop GIG IPv6 services and network
architectures that are reliable, scalable and incrementally implementable in DoD environment.  The contractor shall demonstrate a plan and
ability to fully meet or exceed the required knowledge and experiences related to IPv4/v6 network design and architecture, IP routing, QoS, VPN,
IPv6 network management in large enterprise and/or commercial service provider environment  as required for the solution development of this
task. The contractor shall demonstrate its clear appreciation of the challenges of the technical issues related to E2E interoperability related
to dual-stack based IPv4/IPv6 service network design, transition, and service and network management. Vendor’s strong knowledge of the DoD
networks (both strategically and tactical), and real-world SysML product development experience and capabilities will be favorably considered in
the evaluation.

 3) Management:  The contractor demonstrates a comprehensive management approach that ensures top-quality personnel or are provided to meet all
requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The proposal must provide a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) which demonstrates the right
mix of skill  resources to meet the requirements of the PWS. The resumes of all proposed key personnel shall be provided for government’s
review.  The proposed approach should also address the associated risks with the proposed WBS activities and corresponding mitigation plan when
applicable


4.0 Volume III - Past Performance



4.1 General

Each offeror shall submit a past performance volume with its proposal, including up to three contracts within the past three years that are
similar in nature, complexity, and size to this requirement keeping in mind that more relevant data will be rated higher. The page limit for the
past performance proposals is 2 pages per reference.  For each contract listed, include the following information:
    a. Name of Project
    b. Brief Description of project
    c. Contract or project number
    d. Contract Type
    e. Client/Customer Point of Contact (name, address, phone number, e-mail address)
    f. Dollar/Ceiling value of the contract/project
    g. Period of performance of the contract/project
    h. Relevance of contract/project to requirements of this anticipated effort
    i. Total number and magnitude of task orders (dollar value, duration, etc) awarded to you under the contract
    j. Total number (delineated by business size) of subcontractors/team members managed by you under the contract.

Along with the information required in this paragraph, the offeror shall submit a consent letter executed by each subcontractor, teaming
partner, and/or joint venture partner, authorizing release of past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to such
information.


4.2 Relevant Contracts


Submit information in accordance with Attachment 1:  Past Performance Information on 3  (insert desired numbrecent contracts that you consider
most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort.  Recent is considered to be ongoing contracts or those completed
within three years of the date of issuance of the solicitation.    Re   Also include information on 3 (insert desired number) recent contracts
performed by each of your teaming partners and significant subcontractors that you consider most relevant in demonstrating their ability to
perform the proposed effort.  Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance.  For a description of the characteristics or aspects the
Government will consider in determining recency and relevance, see Section M, provision M002 - Evaluation Factors, paragraph M002c - Past
Performance Factor.


4.2.1 Specific Content

Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed
effort they relate.  This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as
well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a limited or no confidence
rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to
overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the
effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  This may allow the offeror to be considered a higher
confidence candidate.  For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an
offeror has overcome past problems is required.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific technical/management subfactors and
cost/price factor used to evaluate the proposal.




4.2.2 Organizational Structure Change History

Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups,
subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between
conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is
relevant to this procurement.  To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such
changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of
this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/confidence assessment.
 Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offerors, your
"roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government
receives information from other sources.




5.0 Volume IV - Cost/Price



5.1 General Instructions



5.1.1 Cost/Price Reasonableness

This section is to assist you in submitting information other than cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness of your
proposed cost/price.  Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal.  Note that
unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition
either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced
pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror’s proposal.  Offers should be sufficiently
detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed costs/prices rests with the offeror.


5.1.2 Cost/Price Information

Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your
cost/price position.  All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation, must be included in the
section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price volume.  Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included
elsewhere in the proposal.


5.1.3 Cost or Pricing Information Requirements

In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support price
reasonableness.  Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5.  If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is
insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the offeror may be
required to submit certified cost or pricing data.


5.2 Volume Organization

The Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections:
      SECTION 1 - Table of Contents;
      SECTION 2 - Cost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology.
      SECTION 3 – Pricing Tables

requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being
ineligible for award.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying
rationale. Each exception shall be specifically related to each paragraph and/or specific part of the solicitation to which the exception is
taken.  Provide rationale in support of the exception and fully explain its impact, if any, on the performance, schedule, cost, and specific
requirements of the solicitation.


6.3 Other Information Required



6.3.1 Authorized Offeror Personnel
