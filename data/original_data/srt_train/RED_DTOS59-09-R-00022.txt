52.212-4    Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items (Mar 2009)
           Alternate I (Oct 2008)
     (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this
  contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The
  Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will
  perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
      (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and
  shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
      (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as
  promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
      (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after
  acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct
  services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this
  clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours
  incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise
  specified below, the portion of the “hourly rate” attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance
  materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when
  required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]
      (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement
  or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may—
         (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such
  increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or
         (B) Terminate this contract for cause.
        (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the
  contract.
      (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or
  replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is
  due to—
        (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or
        (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor’s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor’s
  managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.
      (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and
  services originally delivered under this contract.
      (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery
  do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.
      (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be
  governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.
   (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a
bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act
(31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not
assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.
  (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.
  (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this
contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be
a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor
shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.
    (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause—

   (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable
control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its
sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common
carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any
excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and
shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
        (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.
    (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt
payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315.

    (i) Payments. (1) Services accepted. Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery
  destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices
  approved by the Contracting Officer:
        (i) Hourly rate.
         (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor
  hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.
         (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.
  Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is
  performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting
  Officer.
         (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the
  Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.
         (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including
  any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records
  that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the
  contract.
         (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having
  performed work on an overtime basis.
              (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime
  rates shall be negotiated.
              (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
              (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the
  overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.
        (ii) Materials.
         (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such
  materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the—
              (1) Quantities being acquired; and
              (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.
         (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the
  actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided
  the Contractor—
              (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or
              (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor’s payment request to the Government and such payment
  is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.
         (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall—
              (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory
  materials; and
              (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are
  identifiable to the contract.
         (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed.
              (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such
  costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel,
  computer usage charges, etc. Insert “None” if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery
  contract, the Contracting Officer may insert “Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no
  reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ‘None’.”]
             (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect
  costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs
  and payment schedule. Insert “$0” if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery
  contract, the Contracting Officer may insert “Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or,
  if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ‘None’).”]
      (2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling
  price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all
  obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments
  and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs
  previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a
  revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time
  during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this
  contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer,
  giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during
  performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be
  substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised
  estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.
      (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule,
  and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless
  and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a
  revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set
  forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price
  before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in
  the ceiling price.
      (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will
  have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting
  Officer):
        (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories
  specified in the contract;

      (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices,

        (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the—

  Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the
  amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.
        (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.
        (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if—

        (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition
  Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.
        (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the “completion invoice” and supporting documentation,
  and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties
  agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable
  following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may
  approve in writing) from the date of completion.
    (7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of
  final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract,
  a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of
  or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.
        (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.
        (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of
  performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives
  notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
  that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
        (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against
  patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.

  regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

  (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose
of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified
payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (j) Risk of loss. Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of
loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon:

sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and
all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct
labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the
effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus
reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have
resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for
this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any
work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.
  (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the
Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with
adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any
amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided
by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination
for convenience.
  (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon
acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.
  (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular
purpose described in this contract.
  (p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for
consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items.
  (q) Other compliances. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations
applicable to its performance under this contract.
  (r) Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts. The Contractor agrees to comply with 31 U.S.C. 1352 relating to limitations on the use
of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.,
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act; 41 U.S.C. 51-58, Anti-Kickback Act of 1986; 41 U.S.C. 265 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to
whistleblower protections; Section 1553 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 relating to whistleblower protections for
contracts funded under that Act; 49 U.S.C. 40118, Fly American; and 41 U.S.C. 423 relating to procurement integrity.
  (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
    (1) The schedule of supplies/services.
    (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts paragraphs of
this clause.
    (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
    (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
    (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
    (7) The Standard Form 1449.
    (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
    (9) The specification.
  (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR
database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

                                                                 (End of clause)

                                                                STATEMENT OF WORK


Non-Personal Services

This award identifies services that are strictly non-personal in nature.


Inherently Governmental Functions

This requirement has been reviewed and contains no services that are inherently governmental functions.

Work Site

It is not anticipated that any of the contractor’s staff members serving on this project will be stationed on Government premises.  Instead, it
is anticipated that the contractor’s staff members will be stationed on the contractor’s premises.

Travel

It is not anticipated that the contractor’s staff members will be required to do any travel in the performance of this contract, and therefore
no travel costs are included within the stated pricing structure of this contract.  Any travel which might hereafter be requested by the
Government would be reimbursed to the contractor in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations, and from funds hereafter added to this contract
by way of a written Modification to this contract.


Introduction to the Technical Requirements of this Statement of Work

The Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (RITA/BTS) is the lead agency for Geospatial
Information and Services within the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT).  As such, RITA/BTS has many responsibilities:

      • Represents the USDOT in the Federal Geographic Data Committee.
      • Collects geospatial data from throughout the USDOT, converts it to a standard format, performs QA/QC on each dataset, produces metadata
        for each dataset, and distributes the data as part of the National Transportation Atlas Databases (NTAD).  The NTAD is distributed as an
        annual CDROM release and through internet downloads.
      • Develops geospatial applications to assist in the analysis of transportation issues.
      • Provides geospatial mapping and analysis support to RITA/BTS and the other USDOT agencies.
      • Provides geospatial mapping and analysis support, including 24-7 on-call support, to the USDOT Crisis Management Center (CMC) and
        Continuity of Operations (COOP) site.

Many, if not all of these responsibilities require a seamless, complete, up-to-date, and routable geospatial road-and-street network.  No such
data exists in the public domain, so RITA/BTS requires a lease of commercial geospatial road-and-street network data.  This data must be
integrated with other geospatial transportation networks and facilities to form a multi-modal network that supports routing across modes.  This
multi-modal network is used as input to the RITA/BTS application GeoMiler.

Task 1: Lease of Geospatial Road-and-Street network Data

The contractor shall provide a seamless, complete, and up-to-date geospatial road-and-street network to RITA/BTS for use in its applications.
The data must support vehicle routing and navigation.  The contractor shall provide RITA/BTS with semi-annual updates to this data.  The
contractor shall provide licenses for ten (10) RITA employees to use such data and to use that network.

Task 2: Technical Support

The contractor shall provide technical support to RITA/BTS geospatial staff on the use of the geospatial road-and-street network data provided
to RITA/BTS by the contractor.    This support shall be available during normal business hours Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.
Normal business hours are defined as 8:00am through 6:00pm Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Time, as applicable.

Task 3:  Integration into GeoMiler Multi-modal Network

The geospatial road-and-street network data provided to RITA/BTS by the contractor must be integrated—and must remain integrated—with other
geospatial transportation networks and facilities to form a multi-modal transportation network that supports routing across modes.  This multi-
modal network is used as input to the RITA/BTS application GeoMiler.  The GeoMiler application was developed by RITA/BTS (who owns the
intellectual property rights) to calculate the most likely routes taken by shipments sampled in the Commodity Flow Survey, which is performed
every 5 years.  Many of the shipments are multi-modal, which leads to the requirement for a multi-modal transportation network.  There is
proprietary information embedded in the GeoMiler application, so it cannot be shared with this procurement’s offerors.  Although the GeoMiler
application cannot be shared, the data elements that comprise the transportation multi-modal network can and will be shared so that this task
can be completed.  The data for this task will be collected and kept in ESRI Shapefile format.  FGDC Metadata standards will be followed.  To
complete this task, several subtasks must be performed:

      Task 3a:  Creation of Subnetwork


      The GeoMiler application uses a subset of all roads that represent major routes across the country.  The subset is approximately 1 million
      miles.  The subset is based on the functional classifications of the roads.  Once the subset is extracted from the complete road-and-street
      network, it must be optimized for routing by removing extraneous nodes.  The resulting subnetwork must be tested to ensure it functions
      correctly for routing.


      Task 3b:  Integration with Other Transportation Networks/Facilities


      The subnetwork created in Task 3a must be physically connected, through the creation of straight line geospatial links, with other
      transportation facilities and networks.    This occurs by creating a link from the nearest node on the network to the locations described
      in the transportation facilities databases.   Using these straight line links will optimize the networking performance and limit the multi-
      modal network’s size without adversely affecting the quality of analysis.  These straight line links will created for the following
      geospatial transportation networks and facilities:

      Task 3c:  Testing and Verification of Multi-modal Network


      The multi-modal network created in Task 3b must be tested for use in the RITA/BTS application GeoMiler.  The testing will use origin-
      destination pairs that have been verified in the existing GeoMiler.  QC analysis will include but not limited to the following example: (1)
      using a origin and a destination location (represented as zip code point locations), (2) the analysis successfully follows the multimodal
      network (this includes transfer between modal networks), and (3) the analysis identifies the shortest path between the origin/destination
      pair identified in (1) using a given metric such as distance.  Errors that are found during this process must be corrected.  The completion
      of this task will result in the delivery of a multi-modal network consisting of roads, rail, waterways, and straight line links from the
      network to identified point databases.


Tasks 1 and 2 above are annual tasks throughout the Period of Performance listed below.  Task 3 is a one time effort that will occur in the
contract’s Base Year.

understand and adhere to the terms of the non-disclosure agreement, protecting the procurement sensitive information of the Government and the
proprietary information of other contractors.  Assignment of staff who have not executed the Non-Disclosure Agreement, or any failure to adhere
to the Non-Disclosure Agreement, shall constitute default on the part of the Contractor.  The required Non-Disclosure Agreement is given in the
immediately following indented text:


                                                   CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT




      It is understood that as part of my official duties under the Road & Street Network Geospatial Data and Technical Support contract,  I  may
      come in contact with Government procurement sensitive information or proprietary business information from other  contractors  (e.g.,  cost
      data). I, as an official Government contractor employee, certify that I will not disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known, in any
      manner or to any extent, to any individual other than an appropriate or authorized  Government  employee,  the  content  of  any  sensitive
      information provided during the course of my employment.  I understand that for
      the purpose of this agreement, sensitive information is to include procurement data,  contract  information,  plans,  strategies  or  other
      information not of a publicly released and available nature through appropriate sources.


      I further certify that I will use proprietary business information only for official purposes in the  performance  of  the  Road  &  Street
      Network Geospatial Data and Technical Support contract, and will disclose such information only to those individuals who  have  a  specific
      need to know in performance of official Government duties.  I specifically will not disclose  any  such  information  to  employees  of  my
      company or any other contractor employees who have not  signed  an  applicable  non-disclosure  agreement.   I  will  take  all  reasonable
      precautions to protect and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure and use of such information.


      I hereby certify that I have read the non-disclosure agreement described above and I am familiar with the directives and policies governing
      the disclosure of sensitive information.  I will fully and completely observe these directives and will not disclose  such  information  to
      any unauthorized person, or use any information obtained for private use or gain at any time.

      ORGANIZATION/AFFILIATION








      Information Assurance

Contractor personnel will be required to adhere to all DOT IT policies to guide the effective and efficient use and management of information
resources within DOT.


      Protection of Information

The contractor shall ensure that staff follows appropriate government standards regarding classified information.  The contractor’s personnel
shall also follow government and Departmental procedures with regards to information that contains sensitive personally identifiable
information, or is identified as “For Official Use Only” Controlled Unclassified Information, or other similar control classifications.


                Dissemination of Information/Publishing

There shall be no dissemination or publication, except within and between the Contractor and any subcontractors or specified Team members who
have a need to know, of information developed under this contract or contained in the reports to be furnished pursuant to this contract without
prior written approval.


      Security Clearance Requirements

It is not anticipated that any of the contractor’s staff members will ever be stationed on U. S. Government premises for the performance of this
contract, and it is therefore not anticipated that any of the contractor’s staff members will need any security clearances.  And it is
acknowledged and agreed that the pricing on which this contract was awarded was based on the understanding that none of the contractor’s staff
members would ever be stationed on U. S. Government premises or need any security clearances for the performance of this contract.

Any contractor staff member(s) merely attending a meeting or meetings on DOT’s premises would be admitted as “Visitors” to such premises in
order to attend such meeting(s), and would not need to have any security clearances.

In the unlikely event that there is ever hereafter issued a bilateral Modification to this contract, authorizing or requiring any of the
contractor’s staff members to be stationed on U. S. Government premises, such staff members would need to obtain a security clearance conforming
to DOT’s security requirements applicable at such future time.  The parties understand and agree that no unilateral contract Modification could
ever be used as the mechanism for stationing any of the contractor’s staff members on Government premises, and that any such assignment could
only be accomplished, if at all, by means of a bilateral Modification (i.e., a Modification signed both by the contractor and by a DOT
Contracting Officer).



        Access to Sensitive Information.

a.    Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information, as described in paragraph d below, which shall not be disclosed by
   the contractor unless authorized by the contracting officer.  To protect sensitive information, the contractor shall provide training to any
   contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual's
   suitability to have such authorization.  Contractor employees found by the Government to be unsuitable or whose employment is deemed contrary
   to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security, may be prevented from performing work under the particular
   contract when requested by the contracting officer.

b.    The contractor shall ensure that contractor employees are: (1) citizens of the United States of America or an alien who has been lawfully
   admitted for permanent residence or employment (indicated by immigration status) as evidenced by Citizenship and Immigration Services
   documentation; and (2) have background investigations in accordance with DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management.

c.    The contractor shall include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded involving access to Government facilities, sensitive
   information, and/or resources.

d.    Sensitive Information is “proprietary data or other information that, if subject to unauthorized access, modification, loss or misuse
   could adversely affect national interest, conduct of Federal programs, or privacy of individuals specified in the Privacy Act, but has not
   been specifically authorized to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy under an Executive Order or Act of
   Congress."



        Contractor Employees

            Contractor Identification

The contractor shall ensure that contractor personnel identify themselves as contractors when attending meetings, answering Government
telephones, providing any type of written correspondence, or working in situations where their actions could be construed as official Government
acts.

      Key Personnel

The Contractor agrees that a partial basis for award of this contract is the continuity of key personnel.  Accordingly, the Contractor agrees to
assign to this contract those personnel who have qualifications to meet the performance objectives as specified above in the “Personnel
Qualifications” section of this contract.  No substitution shall be made without prior notification to, and concurrence of, the Contracting
Officer.  During the first ninety days of performance the Contractor shall make no substitutions of key personnel unless the substitution is
necessitated by illness, death, or termination of employment.  All proposed substitutes shall meet or exceed the qualifications of the person to
be replaced, as determined by the COTR in consultation with the DOT Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer shall be notified in writing
of any proposed substitution at least 14 working days in advance of the proposed substitution.  Such notification shall include:

(1)   an explanation of the circumstances necessitating the substitution;
(2)   a complete resume of the proposed substitute; and
(3)   any other information requested by the Contracting Officer to enable him to judge whether or not the Contractor is maintaining the same
   high quality of personnel that provided the partial basis for award.

The contractor’s GIS Analyst is considered key personnel and shall not be removed or replaced without prior written approval from the
Contracting Officer:



      Contractor access to DOT Network Systems - Non-U.S. Citizens

Only United States citizens shall be granted a personnel security clearance, assigned to sensitive duties, or granted access to classified
information unless approved by an authority designated in Appendix 6 of DoD 5200.2-R.  Exceptions to these requirements shall be permitted only
for compelling national security reasons.

Non-U.S. citizens are not being adjudicated by any government agency for a trustworthiness determination at this time.  Non-U.S. Citizens are
not allowed access to any DOT security systems/networks

The contractor shall ensure that data is continuously protected from unauthorized access, use, modification, or disclosure. The contractor shall
comply with all previously stated requirements for HIPAA, Personnel Security, Electronic Security, and Physical Security.



      Contractor access to classified information

The Contractor will not require access to classified information while performing this contract.

1252.237-70      Qualifications of contractor employees. (APR 2005)
As prescribed in (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.110(a), insert the following clause:
a. Definitions.  As used in this clause-  “Sensitive Information” is any information that, if subject to unauthorized access, modification,
loss, or misuse, or is proprietary data, could adversely affect the national interest, the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy of
individuals specified in The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, but has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive
Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.
b. Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information which shall not be disclosed, by the contractor unless authorized in
writing by the contracting officer. To protect sensitive information, the contractor shall provide training to any contractor employees
authorized to access sensitive information, and upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual’s suitability to have
authorization.
c. The Contracting Officer may require dismissal from work those employees deemed incompetent, careless, insubordinate, unsuitable, or otherwise
objectionable, or whose continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national
security.
d. Contractor employees working on this contract must complete such forms, as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the
conduct of background investigations to determine suitability. Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Contracting Officer. Upon
the Contracting Officer’s request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required.
e. The Contractor shall ensure that contractor employees are:
(1) Citizens of the United States of America or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or employment (indicated by
immigration status) as evidenced Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services documentation; and
(2) Have background investigations according to DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management.
f. The Contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer when an employee no longer requires access to DOT computer systems due to
transfer, completion of a project retirement or termination of employment.
g. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to
Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources.
                                                                 (End of clause)





      Quality Assurance

In addition to the contractor’s following it Quality Assurance Plan, the contractor’s quality assurance shall also require that the contractor
submit Monthly Progress Reports to the COTR and  attend regular contract performance review meetings with the COTR to survey quality of products
and services.  It is anticipated that those performance review meetings will be conducted telephonically, and without any need for the
contractor’s personnel to be physically present on Government premises.

      Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
The Government intends to utilize a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) to monitor the quality of the Contractor’s performance.  The
oversight provided for in the contract and in the QASP will help to ensure that service levels reach and maintain the required levels throughout
the contract term.  Further, the QASP provides the Contracting Officer Technical Representative with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or
deficient performance, and provides verifiable input for the required Past Performance Information Assessments.  The QASP will be finalized
immediately following award and a copy provided to the Contractor after award.   The QASP is a living document and may be updated by the
Government as necessary.

      Performance Requirements Summary Matrix
By monitoring the Contractor, the Contracting Officer Technical Representative will determine whether the performance levels set forth in the
contract have been attained.  Performance standards are specified in the following Performance Requirements Summary Matrix in the Standard and
Acceptable Quality Level columns.

      Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)/ Information (GFI)/Facilities

       Government Furnished Facilities

DOT’s Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) will provide, to the contractor, enough access to RITA’s relevant computer
systems to enable the contractor to install the contractor’s road & street network geospatial data into RITA’s relevant computer systems; and
RITA pledges to cooperate fully with the contractor in arranging and granting such access.  However, it shall be the contractor’s responsibility
to perform all work needed to ensure that such geospatial data are integrated into RITA’s relevant computer systems and to ensure that such data
are  provided to RITA in a format which is compatible with, and fully usable by, RITA’s relevant computer systems.  (See Task 3, “Integration
into Geomiler Multi-modal Network”, of this Solicitation’s Statement of Work.)  Because it is not anticipated that any of the contractor’s staff
members will be stationed on Government premises, it is not anticipated that DOT or RITA will provide, to the contractor, any office facilities,
equipment, desks, telephones, chairs, personal computers, printers, consumable materials or other materials for daily business use by the
contractor’s staff members in the performance of this contract.

    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after
the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of
entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and
was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be
considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office
designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received
at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile
offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers,
the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions
with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However,
the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may
reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.
  (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation. 
    (1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications,

  (k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges
the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment
of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the
Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain
information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-
5757.
  (l) Debriefing. If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if
applicable:
    (1) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.
    (2) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on
the debriefed offeror.
    (3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
    (4) A summary of the rationale for award;
    (5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
    (6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the
solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

Technical and Cost proposals must be submitted separately. The Offeror must submit one hard original and eight hard copies of its proposal.

The date, time and place offers are due:   See this Solicitation’s Standard Form 1449 (“Solicitation / Contract / Order for Commercial Items”).

              52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)

  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Award of this task order will be made on a competitive best
value basis, using “tradeoff” among cost/price and non-cost/price factors.  The Government may elect to award to other than the lowest priced
offeror, or other than the offeror with the highest rated non-cost/price proposal.  If the award is to be made to the superior offeror, then a
cost/price vs. non-cost/price tradeoff will have to be determined and qualified.    Non-Cost/Price factors will include Past Performance,
Management Approach, Technical Approach, and Quality Control Approach .  The price and non-price evaluation factors numbered in descending order
of importance are as follows:





EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


      Non-Price Factors

DOT will evaluate proposals based upon the following Non-Price evaluation Factors, which are set forth in declining order of importance (Factor
1 being most important, and Factor 5 being least important):

    • Factor 1: Technical Approach
    • Factor 2: Management Approach
    • Factor 3: Personnel
    • Factor 4: Past Performance
    • Factor 5: Quality Control Plan

The five Non-Price Evaluation Factors listed above, taken together (that is, taken in the aggregate), are equal, in importance, to the Price
Factor.


Factor 1:  Technical Approach:  Each Offeror will be evaluated on the completeness, thoroughness, and adequacy of its proposed technical
approach, and on the consistency of that proposed technical approach with the objectives and scope of work and Statement of Work given in this
Solicitation.  The technical approach shall be sufficiently specific, detailed, and complete to clearly and fully demonstrate that the Offeror
has a thorough understanding of all RFP technical requirements.  The technical proposal shall contain sufficient detail to indicate the proposed
means for complying with all requirements contained in the Statement of Work, and shall include a complete explanation of the techniques and
procedures to be utilized.  The technical approach shall include a discussion of each particular Task of the Solicitation’s Statement of Work.

Factor 2:  Management Approach:  Each Offeror will be evaluated on how well its overall program management approach will meet or exceed the
requirements of the Solicitation.  As a part of the evaluation just mentioned, DOT will evaluate the offeror on the matters specified in the
sentence immediately following this one.  Each Offeror’s Management Approach shall convincingly demonstrate that the offeror can and
will—effectively and efficiently and punctually and cost-effectively—manage any contract that might be awarded to the Offeror from this
Solicitation.  In addition, each Offeror’s Management Approach shall convincingly and specifically demonstrate that the Offeror can and will
perform—simultaneously and effectively and efficiently and punctually and cost-effectively—any and all specific assignments that might be
scheduled, by DOT, to run concurrently, or to run in a partially overlapping manner.

Factor 3:  Personnel:  Each Offeror will be evaluated on the qualifications of its proposed personnel as related to the requirements of the
Solicitation, on the commitment of the proposed personnel to this project, on the availability of the proposed personnel for actually serving on
this particular project, and on the reasonableness of the offeror’s proposed master staffing plan and Master Staffing Table.  For purposes of
this “Personnel” evaluation, the term “qualifications” includes each proposed staff member’s relevant prior experience, relevant education, and
any relevant special training.  Each proposed staff member shall meet or exceed the required qualifications listed, for the job-title in
question, in this Solicitation’s Attachment J-9, “Labor Category Descriptions”.  In performing the “Personnel” evaluation, the Government will
also take into consideration the degree to which the offeror’s proposed staffing configuration would enable the offeror to perform several
assignments concurrently under any contract that might be awarded to the offeror from this Solicitation.  In evaluating the availability of each
particular proposed staff member to serve on this particular Airline project, the Government will examine the information displayed in the
offeror’s Table of Other Commitments, but the Government’s review of each proposed staff member’s availability will not necessarily be limited
to an examination of that Table.  In determining any proposed staff member’s qualifications and availability, the Government reserves the right
to take into consideration information which is not displayed in the offeror’s proposal but which nevertheless:  (a) is known to one or more
members of the Government’s Technical Evaluation Panel; or (b) is contained in any of DOT’s files; or (c) is obtained by DOT from any other
Federal Department or Agency.  The Government, however, is not promising to look beyond any offeror’s proposal.  A proposed staff member whom
DOT determines is not sufficiently available to serve on this particular project cannot and will not receive full credit in the evaluation
process (and may not receive any credit)—no matter how excellent that person’s qualifications otherwise are.

Factor 4:  Past Performance:  Each Offeror will be evaluated on how its past performance demonstrates its capability and capacity to effectively
deliver high quality and timely service and solutions in a performance-based environment.  DOT will consider the following aspects of each
offeror’s past performance:  technical quality; timeliness; cost controls achieved by the offeror; and the offeror’s business relations.  (See
this Solicitation’s Attachment J-1, “Past Performance Questionnaire”.   In conducting the past performance assessment, DOT may use data obtained
from other sources as well as that provided in the proposal.  Lack of relevant past performance will result in assignment of a neutral past
performance rating indicating neither a favorable nor unfavorable evaluation.  To the extent that an offeror-company is not able to provide
completed Past Performance Questionnaire forms or “Previous Contracts” listings (see this Solicitation’s Attachment J-2) for past projects that
were performed by the offeror-company itself, the offeror may instead provide such information for projects that were performed by any of the
individual staff members whom the offeror is proposing to use for this Geospatial project, and regardless of what employer-company such
individual staff members served under while performing such previous projects.   In evaluating Past Performance, the Government reserves the
right to look beyond the information given or cited in the Offeror’s proposal, and reserves the right to also consider sources including, but
not limited to:  relevant past performance information known by one or more members of the Technical Evaluation Panel; relevant past performance
information contained within DOT’s files; and relevant past performance information obtained from organizations other than DOT.  Lack of
relevant past performance will result in assignment of a neutral past performance rating indicating neither a favorable or unfavorable
evaluation.

    • Factor 5:  Quality Control Plan.  Each Offeror will be evaluated on how well its quality control plan will meet or exceed the requirements
      of the Solicitation.


The following rating method will be used in the evaluation of Non-Price Factors:

Price Factor

The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed price for adequate support and for reasonableness and for realism and for its
competitiveness as against the prices proposed by the other offerors.     But in evaluating proposals on the Price Factor, the Government will
take into consideration not only the price actually shown in each offeror’s proposal, but also the necessary and consequential costs, to DOT, of
integrating the street-network data proposed to be provided by the offeror, into DOT’s existing GeoMiller Multi-modal Network, and into other
Transportation Networks / Facilities, as well as the consequential cost to DOT of testing and verification of the resulting Multi-Modal
Network—as all of that is described in Task 3, Task 3a, Task 3b, and Task 3c of the Statement of Work for this project.

The five Non-Price Evaluation Factors listed above, taken together (that is, taken in the aggregate), are equal, in importance, to the Price
Factor.













    Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
    A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.




          REQUIRED NUMBER OF COPIES OF PROPOSAL

Each offeror must submit one (1) bound hard-paper original and eight (8) bound hard-paper copies of its proposal, and must separate the
technical and staffing proposal from the cost proposal.  That is, the cost proposal shall be bound separately from the technical and staffing
proposal.

In addition, each offeror is asked to submit one CD copy of its technical and staffing proposal, and one separate CD copy of its cost proposal.

Each offeror shall CONSPICUOUSLY display this Solicitation’s identifying number (DTOS59-09-R-00022) on the OUTSIDE of the OUTER container(s) or
package(s) in which the offeror’s proposal is submitted to DOT.


LATE PROPOSALS WILL BE PROCESSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR).

FAXED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

E-MAILED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

TELEPHONED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Each offeror must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, with its
proposal.  The best place to put that information is probably in the Cost Proposal volume.

An offeror may propose more or less than the estimated level of effort, but all offerors are reminded that the resulting contract will be Fixed-
Price.  The offeror should propose the number of hours and the number of staff persons it reasonably believes can perform the functions of this
Solicitation’s Statement of Work.

              Potential travel costs and other direct costs are discussed in preceding sections of this Solicitation, and are also discussed
              below.













TECHNICAL PROPOSAL VOLUME I - CHAPTER 1.   MANAGEMENT
    APPROACH


              The offeror shall explain how it plans to manage this project.  Issues to be addressed include, but are not necessarily limited
              to:  (a) how the offeror would manage and ensure the timely performance of multiple concurrent assignments having Deliverable
              Items potentially due in close succession or on the same day; (b) how the offeror would minimize and manage any turnover of staff
              members; and (c) how the offeror would expedite its preparation and submission of Deliverable Items.










               TECHNICAL PROPOSAL VOLUME I - CHAPTER 2.  TECHNICAL APPROACH


In preparing the technical approach  portion of its proposal, the offeror should provide narrative and other information that the offeror
considers relevant to the work required for the Airline project, and that best demonstrates the offeror’s technical capabilities in the areas
relevant to that project.



              TECHNICAL PROPOSAL VOLUME I - CHAPTER 3.  PERSONNEL



            A.  Provide Resumes

In Chapter 3 of Volume I, a resume shall be included for each proposed staff member whose name has been identified.

Each resume shall clearly identify and describe the individual’s related project experience and education as it relates to the performance of
the project envisioned in this Solicitation.








      B.  Provide a Table of Proposed Personnel and Their Other Commitments



In Chapter 3 of Volume I, provide a table showing the names and other commitments of all proposed named staff members.  And for each such
individual, show the following information in that table: the name of the individual’s employer; the position that the individual is proposed to
occupy on this particular  project; the project name and the contract number of every other project (Federal and non-Federal) on which the
individual is currently committed to serve at any time during the period beginning on January 1, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2014; and the
Offeror’s best good-faith estimate of the aggregate grand total number of staffing hours that each such separate individual will be required to
work on that individual’s Other Commitments during the time period beginning on January 1, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2014.   For purposes
of this required Other Commitments Table, an individual is “committed” to serve on only those “other projects” for which there is already in
existence a signed contract, a signed task order, or some other mutually-binding written agreement.  In other words, the Other Commitments Table
need not show “other projects” that are merely in the bidding phase and are not yet awarded.   Outside the Other Commitments Table just
described, but in a position not far away from that table, each Offeror’s proposal shall explicitly state each and all of the assumptions used
by the Offeror in deriving the estimated total number of Other Commitment Staffing Hours shown for each separate individual listed in the Other
Commitments Table.  For example, if a given individual’s Other Commitments include an existing IDIQ Task Order Contract, then in estimating that
individual’s Other Commitment staffing hours under that existing contract, the Offeror should take into consideration factors such as, but not
necessarily limited to:  the number of other companies also holding IDIQ Task Order Contracts for that same project; any past experience
regarding numbers and sizes of Task Orders actually issued under that existing contract or under other similar existing or closed contracts; and
numbers of staffing hours actually billed under that existing contract or under other similar existing or closed contracts.


           C.  Provide a Master Staffing Table

In Chapter 3 of Volume I, each Offeror shall provide a Master Staffing Table which shall display the Offeror’s estimated (proposed) numbers of
staffing hours by project year, by task, by named proposed individual staff member and job title, and for each and every tier (that is, for the
prime contractor, for each separate subcontractor, and for each separate consultant)-----and also for each un-named (un-determined) staff member
and by his or her job title and tier-level and proposed numbers of staffing hours.  Un-named staff members can be denoted as “not-yet-
identified” or “not-yet-determined” or “to-be-determined”-----but each un-named staff member’s intended job title, estimated proposed numbers of
staffing hours by task and by tier level, shall all be explicitly shown on the Master Staffing Table.  To repeat, the Master Staffing Table must
be a comprehensive one which covers the entire 60-month (five-year) project and each of its separate project-years, and which  includes not only
the prime Offeror’s proposed internal staffing but also the staffing proposed for each separate subcontractor and consultant.

It is requested----but it is not required----that the entire Master Staffing Table be presented on just one page; and that page can be a fold-
out page, provided that it is bound into the proposal and is folded down to a size not exceeding 8 ½ by 11 inches.   An Offeror may use, in the
Master Staffing Table, a font size smaller than 12-point, provided that the font is fully legible.


            D.  Other Requirements

The estimated professional and technical staffing shall be provided in direct productive labor hours (as displayed in the Government’s table of
estimated staffing hours, below.)   Direct productive labor hours are defined as actual work hours, exclusive of vacation, holiday, sick leave
and all other absences.

Before submitting its proposal to DOT, each offeror shall cross-check the configuration of staffing hours shown in the offeror’s Master Staffing
Table, against the configuration of staffing hours priced out in the offeror’s Volume II Cost Proposal, to make sure that precisely the same
configuration of staffing hours is used in both of those places.





              TECHNICAL PROPOSAL VOLUME I - CHAPTER 4.   QUALITY CONTROL PLAN


Include in Chapter 4 of Volume I a Quality Control Plan.



              TECHNICAL PROPOSAL VOLUME I - CHAPTER 5.  PAST PERFORMANCE




       PAST PERFORMANCE NARRATIVE

In preparing the past performance narrative portion of its proposal, the offeror should provide narrative and other information that the offeror
considers to be relevant experience for the work required by the solicitation’s statement of work and that best demonstrates the offeror’s
previous performance of those activities on other contracts.  The offeror should also address the following specific past performance sub-
criteria (which are also listed above, in this Solicitation):




   1. Technical Quality of Offeror’s Past  Performance




 2. Timeliness of Offeror’s Past Performance


   3.  Offeror’s Cost Controls on past projects


   4.  Offeror’s Business Relations  This area deals with the contractor’s commitment to satisfaction and cooperative/reasonable businesslike
behavior with own staff and customers to include: effective management, responsiveness to contract requirements, operates with honesty and
integrity, prompt notification of problems, flexible and proactive qualities, effective contractor-recommended solutions, and effective
subcontracting and teaming arrangements.




          TECHNICAL PROPOSAL VOLUME I PREVIOUS CONTRACTS LIST


The Offeror must provide past performance references for itself and for each proposed subcontractor.  This past performance information must be
submitted in the proposal using Attachment J-2 -“Previous Contracts List.”  The offeror shall complete the “Previous Contracts List” for itself
and for all proposed subcontractors (if applicable), providing the required information on the form for the three largest dollar value, and four
most recent contracts, task orders or projects, which include work primarily the same/very similar to that called for in this Solicitation’s
Statement of Work, and which have been performed over the last five years.  The contracts listed by the offeror in Attachment J-2 need not
necessarily have been completed.  Based on the instructions set forth above in this section, a minimum of seven contracts should be listed in
the offeror’s Previous Contracts List.  In addition, the contracts listed in Attachment J-2 shall also include at least one contract performed
(or currently being performed) by each of the offeror’s proposed subcontractors.   Any offeror’s completed Attachment J-2 may of course show
more than the minimum required numbers of contracts.










        PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONNAIRES


Each offeror must provide completed Past Performance Questionnaires (see Attachment J-1) for itself and for each proposed subcontractor, from
current and/or previous customers as identified in the offeror’s completed Attachment J-2.

a.   Using Attachment J-1 – “Past Performance Questionnaire” each offeror shall obtain—and shall include, with the Volume I of the offeror’s
proposal initially submitted to DOT—one original (and no copies) of a completed  Past Performance Questionnaire form from at least five of the
references listed in the offeror’s completed Attachment J-2 Previous Contracts List.  (To preserve any desired confidentiality, each customer of
the offeror, who completes a Past Performance Questionnaire, may seal the completed Questionnaire before giving it to the offeror for inclusion
with the Offeror’s Volume I proposal.)  Each prime offeror should attempt to include, in its required minimum of five completed Past Performance
Questionnaires, at least one completed Past Performance Questionnaire for each proposed subcontractor.

b.    If any customer (i.e., provider of a past performance reference for an offeror) prefers that the offeror not see the completed Past
Performance Questionnaire, the customer may seal the completed Past Performance Questionnaire before returning it to the offeror.  In any event,
each of, and all of, an offeror’s completed Past Performance Questionnaires must be included (as originals) in the hard original of the
offeror’s initially-submitted Volume I proposal.




                     USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION





The Government may use past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror or teaming partners.  The
Government shall determine the relevance of similar past performance information and apply it as considered appropriate in the evaluation and/or
source selection processes.








 LOGISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR GETTING HARD-COPY PROPOSALS INTO THE REQUIRED DELIVERY POINT IN THE DOT HEADQUARTERS BUILDING


(Please show this RFP’s identifying number (DTOS59-09-R-00022)  and this RFP’s closing date on the OUTSIDE of the box(es) or container(s) in
which your proposal is submitted to DOT.)

NOTE:     In the past, couriers could deliver proposals directly to individual offices located within DOT’s headquarters building.   But  special
security procedures have since been instituted which now prohibit couriers from  delivering  material  directly  to  individual  offices  located
within DOT’s headquarters Building.  Couriers must now deliver material to a guard station at the DOT  headquarters  building.   The  guard  will
accept the material, dismiss the courier, and then the material will be examined and x-rayed prior to being  delivered  to  the  OST  Acquisition
Services Division (M-63) through the normal mail delivery procedures, which could take many working days.  Couriers and individuals  who  instead
intend to hand-carry packages all the way to the required M-63 delivery point must have such packages x-rayed behind a guard station in  the  DOT
headquarters building (hours of operation: 7 am to 5 pm local time) prior to delivery to M-63.   The delivery of proposals all the way  to  M-63,
by courier or by any other person, will consequently take longer than it did prior to the  institution  of  those  special  security  procedures.
Offerors must now make allowances for those new security procedures in order to assure that their proposals  do  physically  arrive  in  M-63  on
time.  Proposals must be physically received in the OST Acquisition Services Division (M-63), in Room W83-497 on  Floor  8W  of  DOT’s  new  West
headquarters building, located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S.E., Washington, D. C. 20590, by this Solicitation’s stated  time  and  date  due,  in
order to be considered timely---- not merely delivered to a guard station, to a DOT mail room, to a  loading  dock,  to  a  courier,  to  a  post
office, or to an overnight delivery service.  To assist in expediting delivery, the outside of the  box(es)  or  container(s)  that  enclose  the
offeror’s proposal must show this RFP’s identifying number (DTOS59-09-R-00022) and  must  show  this  RFP’s  closing  date.   See  the  suggested
precautions, below.


NOTE:  SUGGESTED PRECAUTIONS REGARDING SUBMITTAL OF PROPOSALS:   Because of the difficulty in  delivering  packages  to  DOT  (see  the  separate
“Note” appearing immediately above), it is strongly recommended that each Offeror arrange to have the complete hard original and the  8  complete
hard copies and the CD copies of its proposal all hand-carried, by an  employee  of  the  offeror-company,  to  the  guard  station  in  the  DOT
headquarters building not later than the morning of the day before this Solicitation’s stated  due-date  for  receipt  of  proposals.   And  each
offeror who uses that delivery procedure should tell Mr. Mowery about the impending hand-delivery by sending an e-mail to Mr. Mowery on  the  day
before the delivery is to be made.  And each offeror who uses that delivery procedure should have its delivering employee send an e-mail  to  Mr.
Mowery and / or place a cell-phone call to Mr. Mowery approximately 30 minutes before the delivering employee believes that she  or  he  will  be
arriving at the DOT guard station with the proposal in hand.  And upon the delivering employee’s actual arrival at the  DOT  guard  station,  the
employee should again call Mr. Mowery and / or send an e-mail message to Mr. Mowery, advising Mr. Mowery  that  the  employee  is  at  the  guard
station with the proposal in hand.  Upon receipt of such notifications regarding impending deliveries of proposals, Mr. Mowery will make a  good-
faith attempt to meet each delivering employee at the DOT guard station, for the purpose of escorting  the  employee  and  the  proposal  through
DOT’s security system and into M-63.    However, an Offeror’s inability to get such a message and / or cell phone call through to Mr. Mowery,  or
Mr. Mowery’s inability to meet the delivering employee at the DOT guard station, shall not relieve  the  Offeror  of  the  requirement  that  its
proposal physically arrive in Room W83-497 of M-63 by the RFP’s closing date and closing time.  In other words, the mere sending  of  e-mails  or
the placing of  telephone calls or the leaving of voice mail messages for Mr. Mowery does not extend the RFP’s closing date or closing  time  for
any Offeror, and does not change the proposal’s required physical delivery point:   OST Acquisition Services Division (M-63), in Room W83-497  on
Floor 8W of DOT’s new West headquarters building, located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S.E., Washington, D. C. 20590 .  It is  further  recommended
that each Offeror place a follow-up telephone call and send a follow-up e-mail to Mr. Mowery, on the  morning  of  the  RFP’s  closing  date,  to
verify that the proposal and all of the required copies have in fact been received in Room W83-497 of M-63.  An Offeror’s taking the  precautions
recommended in this paragraph must not be construed as a guarantee that the proposal will in fact  arrive  in  Room  W83-497  of  M-63  on  time.
Rather, these precautions are merely intended to minimize the likelihood that the proposal will be received late in  Room  W83-497  of  M-63  and
will therefore be excluded from the competition.





              REQUIREMENT FOR PROVIDING PRICING SPREADSHEETS AND SUPPORT FOR PROPOSED PRICING


              All of an offeror’s proposed hourly labor pay rates for its proposed staff members, and all of an offeror’s other proposed pricing
              rates and proposed cost figures, must be fully displayed in the offeror’s Cost Proposal and must be supported by documentation
              which must be included in the offeror’s cost proposal (Volume II Proposal).






                              A.  Provide the Following Required Pricing Spreadsheets (Budget Summaries)


              Regardless of whether an offeror proposes GSA-approved hourly pay rates for this project, each offeror shall submit, in its Volume
              II Proposal (i.e., Cost Proposal volume): (a) a separate budget summary (pricing spreadsheet) covering each separate year of
              performance of this five-year project, for each separate numbered Task and for each separate lettered sub-Task of this
              Solicitation’s Statement of Work (i. e, for Task 1, for Task 2, for Task 3a, for Task 3b, and for Task 3c); thus each Offeror
              shall submit 25 such budget summaries (five separate numbered Tasks or lettered sub-Tasks, times five project-years); and (b) a
              separate budget summary showing the total price for each separate numbered Task or lettered sub-Task, counted across the entire
              five-year potential period of performance; thus each Offeror shall submit 5 such 5-year budget summaries (one for Task 1, one for
              Task 2, one for Task 3a, one for Task 3b, and one for Task 3c);  and  (c) a separate budget summary showing the total proposed
              price for each separate year of the project (counted across all numbered Tasks and across all lettered sub-Tasks); thus each
              Offeror shall submit five of those yearly budget summaries (one for the first year of the project, and one for the Optional second
              year, one for the Optional third year, and so on, through the Optional fifth year); and (d) a comprehensive budget summary which
              includes all five potential years and all numbered Tasks and all lettered sub-Tasks.  And regardless of whether an offeror
              proposes GSA-approved hourly pay rates for this project, the offeror shall compile and shall provide—on the Offeror’s own pricing
              spreadsheet, for each separate required budget summary described above in this paragraph—a display of the Offeror’s proposed
              pricing that explicitly shows:  (a) estimated labor costs, by labor category (job-title) and by named proposed staff member, and
              the  hourly pay rate for each particular labor category and for each particular proposed named staff person, and the name of the
              individual or individuals proposed to serve in each particular proposed labor category; and (b) the estimated number of staffing
              hours to be worked (on this project) by each particular labor category and by each particular named proposed staff member; and (c)
              the proposed geospatial data licensing fees applicable to that particular pricing spreadsheet; and (d) the resulting total dollar-
              cost for that particular pricing spreadsheet.






              Provide Pricing Support for Proposed Licensing Fees for Use of Road & Street Geospatial Data


              As to an offeror’s proposed licensing fees to be charged to this project for RITA’s use of road & street network geospatial data,
              the simplest—and probably ideal—way in which an offeror could provide cost-and-pricing support would be to include, in the cost
              proposal, copies of actual , recent, similar licensing agreements that have been signed both by the offeror company and by the
              customer company which purchased such licenses.






                           C.  Provide Pricing Support for Proposed Hourly Labor Pay Rates


                                       1.  The Easy Way:  Use Applicable GSA-Approved Hourly Pay Rates


              As to an offeror’s proposed hourly labor pay rates for this project, the simplest—and probably ideal—way in which an offeror could
              provide cost-and-pricing support would be to specifically cite, in the offeror’s cost proposal, and to use in compiling the
              pricing spreadsheets of the offeror’s cost proposal, fully-loaded hourly pay rates taken directly from some applicable GSA-
              Schedule-Contract held by the offeror.  Any offeror relying upon such GSA pricing support shall both:  (a) specify the I. D.
              number of the applicable GSA-Schedule-Contract held by the offeror; and (b) include a complete hard copy of that GSA-Schedule-
              Contract in the offeror’s cost proposal for this project.






              The Hard Way:  Do Not Use GSA-Approved Hourly Pay Rates


              If and only if an offeror is unable or unwilling to cite one of its GSA-Schedule-Contracts in support of the hourly labor pay
              rates proposed by the offeror for this project, then the offeror shall provide support for the hourly labor pay rates proposed for
              this project, in the ways described in the remainder of this Solicitation (below).



Cost/Price Information

1.    Each Offeror shall submit, in its Volume II Proposal (i.e., Cost Proposal volume): (a) a separate budget  summary  covering  each  separate
      year of performance of this five-year project,  for  each  separate  numbered  Task  and  for  each  separate  lettered  sub-Task  of  this
      Solicitation’s Statement of Work (i. e, for Task 1, for Task 2, for Task 3a, for Task 3b, and for Task 3c); thus each Offeror shall  submit
      25 such budget summaries (five separate numbered Tasks or lettered sub-Tasks, times five project-years); and (b) a separate budget  summary
      showing the total price for each separate numbered Task or lettered sub-Task, counted across  the  entire  five-year  potential  period  of
      performance; thus each Offeror shall submit 5 such 5-year budget summaries (one for Task 1, one for Task 2, one for Task 3a, one  for  Task
      3b, and one for Task 3c);  and  (c) a separate budget summary showing the total proposed price  for  each  separate  year  of  the  project
      (counted across all numbered Tasks and across all lettered sub-Tasks); thus each Offeror shall submit five of those yearly budget summaries
      (one for the first year of the project, and one for the Optional second year, one for the Optional third  year,  and  so  on,  through  the
      Optional fifth year); and (d) a comprehensive budget summary which includes all five  potential  years  and  all  numbered  Tasks  and  all
      lettered sub-Tasks.  For each separate required budget summary described above in this paragraph, the Offeror shall compile and provide, on
      the Offeror’s own spreadsheet, a display of the Offeror’s proposed pricing that explicitly shows:  (a) estimated  Direct  Labor  costs,  by
      labor category (job-title), and the un-loaded hourly pay rate of each particular labor category;  (b)  estimated  fringe  benefits  dollar-
      costs, by labor category, and the fringe benefits percentage rate, by labor category, and the base to which the  fringe  benefits  rate  is
      applied; (c) estimated overhead dollar-costs, by labor category, and the overhead percentage rate, by labor category, and the base to which
      the overhead percentage rate is applied; (d) estimated Other Direct Costs; (e) estimated un-loaded travel costs; (f) the estimated  dollar-
      amount of the General & Administrative Expense (G & A), and the percentage rate of G & A, and the base to which the G & A  percentage  rate
      is applied;  (g) the estimated dollar-amount of Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM), and the percentage rate for FCCM, and the base  to
      which FCCM is applied; and (h) the estimated dollar-amount of profit (fee), and the profit percentage rate,  and  the  base  to  which  the
      profit percentage rate is applied.   (As is noted above in this Solicitation, in lieu of explicitly  breaking  out  and  supporting  direct
      labor, fringe benefits, overhead, G & A, FCCM, and profit, an offeror could propose a set of GSA-approved  fully-loaded  hourly  pay  rates
      that: (1) are explicitly shown on a GSA contract that is held by the offeror and that  was  issued  under  a  GSA  Schedule;  and  (2)  are
      associated with GSA-Schedule-Labor-Categories that are equivalent to the labor categories specified  in  this  Solicitation;  and  (3)  are
      applicable to the calendar-time–periods of this project; but any offeror relying upon any such GSA-approved rates shall include a full copy
      of the applicable GSA-contract-document(s) in Volume II of the offeror’s proposal for this  project.   On  each  separate  required  budget
      summary described in this paragraph, the Offeror shall include and shall display the applicable price of each  proposed  subcontractor  and
      consultant.   In addition, all Offerors shall submit the pricing  break-outs  described  in  paragraphs  numbered  2  through  4  appearing
      approximately five pages below. The Offeror’s Business and Cost/Price Proposal  (Volume  II  Proposal)  shall  be  compiled  based  on  the
      assumption that the contract work will start on January 1, 2010, and the Offeror’s estimated proposed pay  escalations  shall  be  computed
      accordingly----not forgetting to include a realistic allowance for any pay raises that are likely to occur: (i) between the date  on  which
      the Offeror submits its proposal and January 1, 2010; and (ii) during the very first year of this Solicitation’s project. Before submitting
      its proposal, each Offeror shall meticulously cross-check the configuration of staffing hours shown in its Volume II Cost Proposal, against
      the configuration of staffing hours shown in its Volume I  proposal; and in performing that  cross-check,  each  Offeror  shall  completely
      eliminate any inconsistencies between the Volume I Proposal and the Volume II Proposal.


      a.    Hours:   Each offeror shall either:  (1) Use precisely the direct productive labor hour estimates given  in  this   Solicitation;  or
           else (2) Explain, in the offeror’s Volume I (Technical and Staffing) Proposal, why the offeror’s proposal does not use precisely  the
           direct productive labor hour estimates given in this Solicitation.


      b.    Even-Flow-of Work Assumption:  Each Offeror shall construct its proposal by assuming that the level of effort expended in the second-
           year of this project (i.e., in the First Option Year) will be equal to that expended in  this  project’s  third  year  (i.e.,  Second
           Option Year), which in turn will be equal to that expended in this project’s fourth year  (i.e.,  Third  Option  Year),  and  so  on,
           through the fifth year of this project.  This project’s very first year, however, may need to include more staffing hours  than  does
           any other single project-year, if the offeror would need to perform any work to adapt its geospatial data to make such data usable by
           RITA’s computer systems (see Task 3 of this Solicitation’s Statement of Work).  Each Offeror’s proposal shall be based on the further
           assumption that the work will flow evenly within any particular year of the project.  Assume that this project’s work will  begin  on
           January 1, 2010.


      c.    Travel Costs:  The subject of Travel costs is also addressed above, in this Solicitation.   Any  travel  hereafter  approved  by  the
           Government’s Contracting Officer would be cost-reimbursable, but only to the extent that such travel costs are actually,  reasonably,
           allocably, and allowably incurred in accordance with Government Travel Regulations, and for purposes other than commuting. But at the
           time this Solicitation was issued, DOT had not anticipated that any travel costs would  actually  be  incurred  under  the  resulting
           contract, and, for that reason, offerors are instructed not to propose  any  travel  costs,  except  as  provided  in  the  remaining
           sentences of this “Travel Costs” section.  If an offeror’s location, circumstances, or other logistical or  technical  considerations
           would make unavoidable the incurrence of travel costs under any resulting contract awarded to that  offeror,  then  the  offeror  may
           propose such non-commuting travel costs as the offeror estimates are reasonable and necessary for the performance  of  this  project;
           and, in that event, the offeror shall also comply with the instructions given in the remainder of this “Travel Costs”  section.   Any
           offeror who proposes any travel costs shall itemize them, by estimated person-trip and by Task and by project-year,  and  shall  show
           the anticipated purpose of each particular person-trip, and shall show the name of  the  person  expected  to  be  involved  in  each
           particular person-trip, and shall show the anticipated point of origin and outbound destination of each particular  person  trip,  as
           well as the estimated number of days and nights to be spent at the outbound destination, and, for each such person-trip  shall  break
           out the estimated un-loaded airfare and the estimated un-loaded lodging cost and the estimated un-loaded per diem cost and any  other
           miscellaneous un-loaded travel costs associated with the particular person-trip.  In addition to the un-loaded travel costs mentioned
           in this paragraph, an Offeror shall either:  (a) also propose any indirect costs (such as General & Administrative Expense) which the
           Offeror’s accounting system allows the offeror to apply to un-loaded travel costs; or  (b)  explicitly  confirm,  in  the  Volume  II
           Proposal, that for the entire five-year Period of Performance of any resulting contract , the Offeror is waiving the right  to  apply
           indirect rates to travel costs incurred under this particular project.  Each Offeror shall allocate  its  proposed  un-loaded  travel
           costs to the prime Offeror and to the proposed subs and consultants  in  a  manner  not  inconsistent  with  the  Offeror’s  staffing
           proposal.  Notwithstanding any travel cost estimates that might be shown in an offeror’s proposal,  non-commuting  travel  costs  for
           travel-trips approved by the Government’s Contracting Officer will be  cost-reimbursable  under  the  contract  resulting  from  this
           Solicitation.

      d.    Other Direct Costs (ODCs):   The subject of Other Direct Costs is also addressed  above,  in  this  Solicitation.   Any  offeror  who
           believes that it needs to propose any Other Direct Costs shall itemize them and shall start by showing un-loaded  dollar-figures  for
           the itemized Other Direct Costs, and that shall be done on a project-year-by-project-year basis.    In  addition  to  displaying  and
           itemizing any proposed un-loaded Other Direct Cost figures on a per-year basis, an Offeror shall:   (a)  also  propose  any  indirect
           costs (such as General and Administrative Expense) that the Offeror’s accounting system allows  to  be  applied  to  un-loaded  Other
           Direct Costs; or (b) explicitly confirm, in the Volume II Proposal, that for the  entire  five-year  Period  of  Performance  of  any
           resulting contract awarded to the offeror, the Offeror is waiving the right to apply indirect cost rates to  un-loaded  Other  Direct
           Costs incurred under this particular  project.   The  term  “Other  Direct  Costs”  includes  items  such  as  equipment,  materials,
           photocopying, faxes, long distance telephone calls, postage, overnight deliveries, etc.   Each Offeror shall allocate its proposed un-
           loaded Other Direct Costs to the prime Offeror and to the proposed subs and  consultants  in  a  manner  not  inconsistent  with  the
           Offeror’s staffing proposal.  Any ODCs included in the winning offeror’s proposal, or approved by DOT’s  Contracting  Officer  during
           the administration of the contract resulting from this Solicitation, will be cost-reimbursable to the extent that they are  actually,
           allocably, reasonably, and allowably incurred by the contractor in the performance of the contract resulting from this Solicitation.


      Budget summaries shall clearly identify the following information as applicable.  (But  note  that  the  following  types  of  support  for
      proposed hourly pay rates are not needed if the offeror proposes, for  itself,  fully-loaded  hourly  pay  rates  taken  directly  from  an
      applicable GSA-Schedule-Contract held by the offeror-company, and if any proposed hourly pay rates for  any  proposed  sub-contractors  are
      likewise taken directly from an applicable GSA-Schedule-contract held by the proposed sub-contractor company).   If  such  pricing  support
      from applicable GSA-Schedule-contract(s) is not used in the offeror’s cost proposal for this project, then in lieu of providing  such  GSA-
      Schedule-contract support, the offeror shall show the following types of support in its cost proposal for this project:


      e.    Direct labor by labor categories (job titles) and by named individual,  to  include  hours,  un-loaded  hourly  pay  rates,  and  pay
           escalations.   These data shall be provided for the prime Offeror and for all proposed sub-contractors and consultants.  Support each
           proposed non-consultant  individual’s actual current un-loaded hourly pay rate, by providing, in the Volume II Proposal,  a  copy  of
           the individual’s most recent payroll record, showing the person’s actual current un-loaded hourly pay rate.  (The individual’s Social
           Security Number, date of birth, home address, and retirement data may  be  redacted  from  each  payroll  record  provided  with  the
           Offeror’s Volume II Proposal.)  If the payroll record does not explicitly show the person’s actual current un-loaded hourly pay rate,
           then derive the individual’s actual current un-loaded hourly pay rate by showing----- in pen-and-ink, on  the  payroll  record----the
           assumptions (number of hours contained in a pay period) and the calculations (usually gross pay divided by number of hours in the pay
           period) that produce the individual’s actual current un-loaded hourly pay rate.   For  example,  an  Offeror’s  cost  proposal  might
           explain that a particular proposed individual’s actual current  $50.00  un-loaded  hourly  pay  rate  is  computed  by  dividing  the
           individual’s $4,000 gross pay by the 80 working hours contained within his standard  pay  period.)   For  each  proposed  independent
           consultant (i. e., a person who would be working on this particular project entirely independently of any employing organization, and
           who would not be sharing any of her/his earnings under this project with any employing organization, and who does not own or rent any
           commercial office space that would be used in performing this project, and who would not be paying any other person to  help  her/him
           perform this project), provide a copy of at least two actual invoices in which the particular consultant in  question  has  billed  a
           client at----and has been paid by that client at---a flat hourly consulting rate approximately equal to or greater than the  starting
           hourly consulting rate being proposed by that particular consultant for  this  project.    For  each  proposed  non-consultant,  show
           precisely how the individual’s proposed starting un-loaded hourly pay rate for this project was computed from the individual’s actual
           current un-loaded hourly pay rate; in other words, show the escalation rate that was applied to the individual’s actual  current  un-
           loaded hourly pay rate to derive his or her estimated starting un-loaded hourly pay rate for this Solicitation’s project.   For  each
           proposed consultant, show how the individual’s proposed starting hourly consulting pay rate for this project was  computed  from  the
           hourly consulting rate that was supported by the consultant’s invoices----again, state explicitly each estimated pay escalation  rate
           that was used in deriving the consultant’s proposed starting hourly consulting  pay  rate  for  this  project.    For  each  proposed
           individual employed within the  prime  offeror’s  company,  and  also  for  each  proposed  individual  employed  within  a  proposed
           subcontractor company, and also for each proposed independent consultant, state explicitly what annual percentage pay escalation rate
           is being proposed, and state explicitly whether each such annual percentage pay escalation rate includes:  (a) only an allowance  for
           inflation; or (b) only an allowance for merit pay raises; or (c) an allowance for both inflation and  merit  pay  raises.   For  each
           proposed non-consultant individual, show precisely how the proposed annual percentage pay escalation rate was used  to  compute  each
           particular out-year un-loaded hourly pay rate.   For each proposed consultant, show how the proposed annual percentage pay escalation
           rate was used to compute each out-year hourly consulting pay rate.


            Note: Offerors must relate their proposed labor categories to the Government’s desired labor categories described  above.  That  is,
           each offeror’s Master Staffing Table and pricing spreadsheets must explicitly show the precise labor-category (job-title) names  that
           are given in this Solicitation’s table of estimated staffing hours.

      f.    The term “indirect cost” includes fringe benefits, overhead, material overhead, general & administrative expense, facilities  capital
           cost of money, and any other cost element that would not be charged as a direct cost.  The term “indirect cost percentage rate” means
           any percentage-rate-number (for example, 30%) that is actually used, in  compiling  the  pricing  spreadsheets  that  appear  in  the
           offeror’s Volume II Proposal, to recover some particular indirect cost.  For example, a fringe benefits rate of 30% of  direct  labor
           costs, would be an “indirect cost percentage rate”, as would an overhead rate of 81% of  direct  labor  and  fringe  benefits  costs.
           Each and every pricing spreadsheet that is presented in the offeror’s Volume II Proposal must explicitly show each of, and  show  all
           of, the indirect cost percentage rates that were used in compiling the pricing spreadsheet in question, and must also explicitly show
           and state the cost-base to which each particular indirect cost percentage rate is applied , and must show the resulting dollar amount
           of each particular indirect cost.    Those data shall be provided in all of the pricing  spreadsheets  in  the  offeror’s  Volume  II
           Proposal, and not only for the prime Offeror but also for all proposed  subcontractors  (but  not  for  independent  consultants,  as
           defined above).  The Volume II Proposal must also include support (such as  cost  pools  and  bases  and  computations  of  resulting
           indirect cost percentage rates; or DCAA approval letters for indirect cost percentage rates) for all indirect cost  percentage  rates
           that are used in pricing out the Volume II Proposal, and not only for the prime offeror but also for every proposed sub.   Absolutely
           no indirect cost percentage rate that is used in pricing out the Volume II Proposal is allowed to be un-stated or un-supported in the
           Volume II Proposal—unless the Volume II Proposal uses loaded hourly pay rates taken directly from an applicable GSA-Schedule-contract
           held by the offeror (or held by the proposed subcontractor company, in the case of proposed subcontractor rates).  For any particular
           indirect cost percentage rate that the Volume II Proposal supports with a DCAA approval letter, the Volume II proposal must include a
           copy of the most recent available DCAA approval letter (on DCAA letterhead stationery) for  the  indirect  cost  percentage  rate  in
           question, and must also include the name, title, current telephone number, current  e-mail  address,  and  current  physical  mailing
           address of the cognizant DCAA auditor and of that auditor’s DCAA supervisor.  For any particular indirect cost percentage  rate  that
           the Volume II Proposal supports with an indirect cost pool and base and computation of the resulting indirect cost  percentage  rate,
           the cost pool and base that were used in deriving that particular indirect cost percentage rate must be the pool  and  base  for  the
           organization’s most recent completed fiscal year for which the cost pool and the base are available----but in no event can  the  cost
           pool and base be for a fiscal year that ended any earlier than May 31, 2008.  In lieu  of  explicitly  breaking  out  and  supporting
           direct labor, fringe benefits, overhead, G & A, FCCM, and profit, an offeror could propose a set of GSA-approved fully-loaded  hourly
           pay rates that: (1) are explicitly shown on a GSA contract that is held by the offeror and that  was  issued  under  a  GSA  Schedule
           applicable to this project; and (2) are associated with GSA-Schedule-Labor-Categories that are equivalent  to  the  labor  categories
           specified in this Solicitation; and (3) are applicable to the calendar-time–periods of this project; but any offeror relying upon any
           such GSA-approved rates shall include a full copy of the applicable GSA-contract-document(s) in Volume II of the  offeror’s  proposal
           for this project.



      g.    A table showing the proposed fully-loaded hourly pay rate(s) for each  particular  individual  in  each  particular  labor  category.
           Provide that information not only for the prime offeror’s own proposed staff members, but also for all proposed staff members who are
           employed by any proposed subcontractor, and also for each and every proposed independent consultant.  For  each proposed staff member
           who is employed by a proposed subcontractor, and also for each proposed individual who would be serving as an independent consultant,
           provide one table showing each individual’s loaded hourly pay rate without the prime offeror’s loadings, and provide a separate table
           showing each individual’s loaded hourly pay rates with the prime offeror’s loadings included.


             h.      Each pricing spreadsheet included in the Volume II Proposal shall explicitly
                        show the proposed profit dollar amount and the proposed profit percentage
                        rate and shall  state explicitly what cost base the proposed profit percentage
                        rate is applied to. But the foregoing sentence applies only if the proposal does
                        not use fully-loaded hourly pay rates taken directly from an applicable GSA-
                        Schedule-Contract held by the offeror or held by the subcontractor in
                        question.




       i.    DOT sees no reason why any offeror’s (or sub’s) profit percentage rates
                   proposed under this Solicitation should be any higher than 9% of all costs.  But
                   the foregoing sentence applies only if the proposal does not use fully-loaded
                   hourly pay rates taken directly from an applicable GSA-Schedule-Contract held
                   by the offeror or held by the subcontractor in question.  Offerors and subs not
                   using GSA rates are strongly discouraged from proposing any profit
                   percentage rate greater than 9% of all costs.


2.    Your proposal must include a statement regarding availability of facilities and equipment necessary to accomplish the  required  work.   If
      any or all of the required facilities are Government owned, a complete listing of these facilities is required and name  of  the  cognizant
      Government agency furnishing the facilities and the facilities contract number(s).

3.    Subcontracts/ Consultants:  If subcontractors and/or individual consultants will be used in carrying out the requirements of this  project,
      the following minimum information concerning each subcontractor and each consultant shall be furnished:

     a. Name and address of the subcontractor or consultant.

     b. Statement of work and work plan (schedule) for the portion of work to be conducted by the subcontractor or consultant.


     c. Names and positions of personnel who will work on the project.


     d. A letter or other statement from each proposed consultant and/or subcontractor indicating that he has been approached on the  matter  of
        participation in this study and that he is willing and able to do so in the terms indicated.


     e. A cost and price analysis of each Subcontractor/ Consultant proposal, as required under FAR 15.404-3.  In addition, show  each  proposed
        subcontractor’s proposed pricing on a separate spreadsheet; and, be sure to show and support each separate subcontractor’s pricing  rate
        elements in the same level of analytical detail as is required for the prime Offeror’s internal pricing, and by named  individual  staff
        member and by labor category and by project year and by Task, just as was required for the  prime  Offeror.    And  show  each  proposed
        independent consultant’s pricing on a separate spreadsheet, down to the level of the consultant’s proposed numbers of staffing hours and
        the consultant’s proposed flat loaded hourly consulting pay rate(s) for those proposed hours----and by Task and by project year, just as
        is required for the prime Offeror.

4.              Facilities Capital Cost of Money

      If you intend to claim facilities capital and cost of money as a cost element of your proposal, you must complete and include Form CASB-CMF
      in your cost proposal.  Form CASB-CMF is not required of Offerors who submit the form to support forward pricing  rate  agreements  or  who
      otherwise make annual submissions of the form to a cognizant Federal administrative or Federal auditing office.
































                                                                  ATTACHMENT J-1

                                                          Past Performance Questionnaire

Referencee Information: Provide the following information for the Organization that performed the referenced work.

Each particular completed Past Performance Questionnaire, as filled out and signed by the offeror’s customer, shall be included with Volume I  of
the offeror’s initially–submitted proposal for this project.   Any  customer  who  has  completed  one  of  these  Questionnaires  may  seal  the
Questionnaire before giving it to the offeror, if the customer does not want the offeror to see the past  performance  evaluation  given  by  the
customer.
