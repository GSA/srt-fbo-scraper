Within a period of 90 days after a stop-work is delivered the Contractor, or within any extensions of that period to which the parties shall agrees, the Contracting Officer shall either-                                                                                                     



Cancel the stop work; or



Terminate the work covered by the order as provided  in the Termination clause of this contract.



If a stop-work order issued under this clause is cancelled or the period oof the order or any extension thereof expires, the Contactor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule, the estimated cost, the fee, or a combination thereof, and in any other terms of the contract that may be affected, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-



The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor’s cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and

The Contractor asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided that, if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon the claim submitted at any time before final payment under this contract.



If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.



If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.

Section 508 Program Need

Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: "Call Center Services."

Section 508 Deliverable Requirements 

The activity to be performed relates to or requires the use of EIT. Section 508 must be considered as a requirement for Call Center Service outputs/deliverables to ensure that it considers specific Section 508 accessibility requirements. Further, Call Center Service outputs/deliverables should not adversely affect accessibility features of existing EIT technologies.  Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their background and experience will enable them to at least meet those technical provisions identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).



Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their background and experience will enable them to at least meet those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).



Information, documentation, and support requirements from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart D have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how the information, documentation, and support proposed for Call Center Service outputs/deliverables will meet at least those information, documentation, and support requirements identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).

Section 508 Evaluation Factors 

Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508.  Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. accessibility capabilities and past performance) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.

Section 508 Acceptance Criteria 

Call Center Service outputs/deliverables resulting from this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility.  Call Center Service outputs/deliverables must include a completed GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of this solicitation.



Call Center outputs/deliverables should meet applicable accessibility requirements and should not adversely affect accessibility features of existing EIT technologies. 








Government Product Accessibility Template for Call (Contact/Help Desk) Center Services

Summary

Column one involves consideration of all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.  

Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable involves consideration of additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.

Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable.

Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard.

Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.



Subpart B -- Technical Standards 

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.  



Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.

Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to the expected deliverable?)

Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in providing accessibility information. 

Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.

Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as applicable.
