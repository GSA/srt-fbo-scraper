Initial price proposal will be from award of this modification to one (1) year with the option of four (4) additional years.

Price proposals shall be submitted in accordance with instructions above.




FORMAT FOR TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

The technical proposal shall be a separate volume from the price proposal.  The technical proposal shall be in Microsoft Word, Excel, or a PDF
attachment.  The technical proposal shall not exceed ten (10) pages in length, with a minimum of 11- point font size text and page margins of at
least one inch on top, bottom and sides, with the exception of fonts used in charts and graphs.

The page limitation does not include the price proposal, the requirements checklist, and the VPAT, but does include of all other addendums,
attachments, exhibits, etc.  As technical proposals are reviewed, evaluated, and rank-ordered prior to reviewing price proposals, all technical
information shall be in the technical proposal to be considered.  If an offeror’s technical proposal exceeds the 10 page limitation, only the
first 10 pages will be distributed to the evaluation team.
The Technical Proposal shall include:

1.  Technical Approach

A technical approach is required from each offeror.  The approach shall be simple, easy to read, and shall clearly and concisely describe the
method of establishing the community of interest,  the assistance provided by the offeror in the implementation and maintenance, communication
and coordination, scheduling of all tasks and subtasks, meetings, and deliverables.  In meeting deliverables, offerors shall elaborate on how
they plan to measure their efforts to ensure the highest quality of performance.

2.  Organizational Experience and Past Performance

Describe the experience and capability of your organization in conducting similar work. Again, “similar" is meant to convey similarity in
subject matter, dollar value, duration, and complexity. Provide summaries for exactly three (3) examples of where your COTS product was used
(past performance). Each example should be not longer than 1 page in description.  Include a brief description of the project, project title,
contract number, period of performance, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, and point-of-contact with email

identified.

3.  Section 508 Compliance

In addition to the Section 508 documentation required and submitted outside the Technical Proposal’s page limits, the offeror may submit a
statement stating the degree of compliance and describing any workaround options that would increase the functional compatibility of their
product.



EVALUATION CRITERIA

Proposals will be ranked against the following three criteria:

FACTOR 1: Technical Approach (most weight)

FACTOR 2:  Organizational Experience and Past Performance (less than Factor 1)

FACTOR 3:  Section 508 Compliance (slightly less than Factor 2).


4.  Award:

The award will be made to the responsive offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government,
considering the price and technical evaluation criteria listed above.  For this request for quotes, the combined weight of the technical factors
is greater than the price.  However, as quotes become more equal in their technical merit, price becomes more important.

                                                           SECTION C- STATEMENT OF WORK


C.1.0 INTRODUCTION

C.1.1  Identification

General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Citizen Services (OCS), Federal Citizen Information Center, Federal Solutions Division, 1800 F
Street, NW, Room G-142, Washington, DC  20405.

C.1.2 Mission

OCS’s mission is to leverage government customer service networks and partnerships government-wide to improve government customer service to
citizens.

Currently, OCS works with a variety of federal networks across government that include web content, contact center, and publication managers, as
well as senior information technology officials. OCS also maintains partnerships with local, state, and national governments around the world.

Given that all of these groups are gate-keepers of service delivery to the public, OCS intends to take an aggressive leadership role to get
these networks to incorporate into their agendas the goal of improved government customer service.

OCS will:
    • Bring these networks together and build relationships among them by providing safe forums for the exchange of knowledge, ideas, insights,
      information, and best practices. 
    • Manage these forums, which may include face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, videoconferences, online publications, and wiki-supported
      communities of practice.
    • Identify cutting-edge customer-service delivery issues that government leaders will need to deal with in the near future and initiating
      steps to help governments address these issues.
    • Compile and disseminate crucial information on best practices and lessons learned in the application of advanced technology to improving
      service delivery.
The over-arching goal for all these activities is to transform the delivery of government services to citizens through the power of
collaboration, which leverages relationships among significant areas of government and affiliated academic, non-profit and industry groups to
ensure that service is transparent and seamless. Research shows–and experience confirms–that citizens do


                                                           SECTION C- STATEMENT OF WORK
not care to know which bureaucracy provides the services they need, as long as they get what they want when they want it. Keeping the end user
in focus, it is critical for all levels of government to work together to breakdown any barriers that impede this objective.  OCS is committed
to facilitating this process through information, interaction, and innovation.

C.1.3 Mission of Other Offices

Other Central Office organizations have a similar mission and may be able to use the same kind of facility.   Therefore we plan to establish a
Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) that would allow other organizations in GSA Central Office to make use of this contract vehicle and acquire the
same software services using their own justification and funding.

C.1.4 Background

OCS was the executive sponsor for the USA Services e-Government initiative   launched in July 2003 with 12 agency partners.  The USA Services
mission was to improve service to citizens. We now have 39 agency partners, including all cabinet level departments that work with OCS to
improve the federal government’s responsiveness to citizens. Working with these partner agencies over the past six  years, the OCS has developed
and implemented a variety of successful programs.

OCS has now fully integrated the USA Services e-Government Initiative  into its infrastructure  and  has established itself as the government
customer service leader in helping agencies serve citizens.  OCS provides executive leadership to help other agencies improve the federal
government’s overall responsiveness to citizen inquiries.  In 2009 OCS will reach out to state, local and international government partners to
join us in this effort

The  Federal Solutions Division--the program office for this initial requirement--supports federal agencies in improving their service to the
public by providing standards for service; the USA Contact contract vehicle to assist agencies in establishing and/or enhancing their contact
center services; and communities of interest to provide agencies a means to communicate and share customer service best practices.  We also
sponsor and share the results of research to gain a better understanding of citizen expectations and the latest techniques for measuring
customer service in government.

C.1.5 Current Activities

In January 2008, OCS established a council dedicated to government contact center leaders.  The Government Contact Center Council is an
interagency group of contact center directors and managers who have responsibility for center operations and strategy.  We are building a close
knit community of contact center leaders from across the government who learn from each other about best practices, problems and solutions,
research, trends and other issues important to the group. 

                                                           SECTION C- STATEMENT OF WORK


Also in January 2008, OCS initiated a Government Customer Service Community of Interest. This community of interest is an interagency group of
customer service professionals.

The goals of both communities of interest are for its members to:
   1. Share information about their best practices, their research, operations and plans for dealing with trends and challenges
   2. Identify and develop recommended solutions for critical customer service-related issues
   3. Network with other communities of interest to help increase professionalism of customer service in government


A community management software tool would enable us to:

    • Create an online forum to facilitate communication within and among the various government customer service community channels to share
      ideas, best practices, and solutions.


    • Share best practices in a membership- only wiki environment that would encourage participation from government customer service
      professionals government-wide.


    • Help government customer service professionals stay current on the latest trends in technology, government initiatives, best practices,
      performance metrics and governance.


    • Provide specific resources, training, and tools that members need to strengthen government customer service in such areas as improving the
      ability for customer service professionals to do their jobs by gaining knowledge of best practices and solutions to problems they face;
      improving overall government customer service; and creating a dynamic community of government customer service professionals government-
      wide.
                                                           SECTION C- STATEMENT OF WORK


C.2.0 SCOPE OF WORK

The objective of this procurement is to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) from which Central Office organizations can acquire
software as a service (SaaS) that integrates modules for a contact directory, public event calendar, email marketing, discussion forum, wiki,
and event (training) registration for presentation.

OCS’s Federal Solutions Division plans to use this facility for support of a government citizen service network website.

*[SaaS is a software application delivery model where a software vendor develops a web-native software application and hosts and operates
(either independently or through a third party) the application for use by its customers over the Internet.  This service is provided on a
subscription basis.]


C.2.1 Contact Directory

The citizen services community requires a contact directory so registered members can easily search for each other online.  The directory would
allow members to create their own online profile and search by specific fields.

Members would be able to indicate their areas of expertise in their contact profile to serve as subject matter experts to the community.
Members should also have the ability to hide contact information from the general membership.  A contact directory is essential to fostering
collaboration on customer service best practices across agencies.  Membership is not expected to exceed 5000.

C.2.2 Events Calendar

An event calendar would provide a resource for the customer service community to share information about training, meetings, and other event
opportunities of interest to the community.

C.2.3 Discussion Forum & Blog

As members strive to improve service across all channels, they will need the ability to communicate to the larger citizen services community
about their issues and new challenges.  A discussion forum that can be searched by discussion topic and archived will allow this kind of
productive exchange.  We will want the capability of creating community blogs and forums for task groups within the larger community.  We wish
to have the capability to lock specific blogs to member-only access and to lock others to read-only access.

C.2.4 Wiki and Collaboration

                                                           SECTION C- STATEMENT OF WORK


Wiki capability will allow members to edit pages and content; view previous versions of, and notes on, wiki-enabled content; upload and embed
rich media file types including audio, video, presentations, etc.; collaborate on group or community files posted within the file library, and
upload documents to a group or community file library.  We also would like to capture comments to posted files.

C.2.5 Event Registration

Event registration will allow members to register online for events such as in-person conferences, telecons, and webinars.

C.2.6 Interactive Surveys, Voting & Quizzes

Occasionally we need to reach a consensus on an issue by voting or collecting input from users via a survey.  We want to be able to create
customized surveys, quizzes and voting ballots and export all respondent data.
