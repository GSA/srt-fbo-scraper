                                                                STATEMENT OF WORK

Work Requirements
A contractor is required to design, create and implement a website to disseminate information for the PIFSC Kona area Integrated Ecosystem
Assessment project. This site will serve as the front end to information about the project though static information, links to other sites of
interest, and an interactive section. The site will be used to serve static information such as reports, documents, text, and presentations as
well as link to other websites and data portals from partners. The interactive section is envisioned to have an interactive mapping component
similar to the mapping component on sites such as http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/hioos/map/ or http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ yet initially smaller in
scope. The existing data layers are in ArcGIS format yet may be served through the web in any government-approved format (e.g. KML) that
facilitates delivery. The contractor will work to incorporate existing government-approved mapping technologies such as Google, Adobe, or ESRI
APIs into the web design. A prototype for the static initial portions of this website are online at http://www.hawaiieod.com/kona_iea.

This website will use current web technologies available (e.g. PHP, HTML, JavaScript (AJAX), CSS, XML/RSS) to produce an easy to navigate
website while assuring compliance with government website standards (e.g. Section 508) and security protocols. The contractor will be supplied
with text and imagery for the web, yet the contractor is expected to be able to provide basic image, text, and possible data manipulation.

The contractor will develop the website for the target platform, which is currently: Centos 5.4, Apache 2.2.3, PHP 5.1.6 (preferably using
CakePHP 1.3 framework), jQuery 1.3.2 javascript library, or if the prefered web framework is Rails, then Rails 2.3.5 (with Ruby 1.9.1) would
likely be the minimum version.

The contractor will deliver a preliminary working website by September 30, 2010. All aspects of the projects do not need to be completed by this
point, yet most facets of the website must be usable by this date. The final website will be completed by the end of the contract period which
is December 15, 2010. The final website must be easy to maintain and be able to easily incorporate new spatial information.

Contractor will deliver bug-free commented code & will supply documentation on the structure, operation, and installation of the web application
& any database code. The contractor will provide a simple wireframe of the site before starting work on the site.

Evaluation Criteria


EVALUATION CRITERIA: "Best Value" Analysis

In addition to cost or price, proposals will also be evaluated based on the following factors and subfactors with Factor A being the most
important.

Factor A -- APPROACH AND CAPABILITIES.
Realism of technical approach and methods proposed and potential for attaining stated objectives and milestones on schedule using the techniques
and resources described; corporate and individual qualifications for the work; adequacy of equipment, materials and facilities proposed;
experience with similar projects.

Factor B -- PAST PERFORMANCE
Performance by the offeror and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to all solicitation requirements, including the quality of services and
products, effectiveness of cost management/control, timeliness of performance, and customer satisfaction; and indication of ability to improve
performance through proactive management.  Evaluation of this factor will be based on the information contained in the technical proposal and
information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance by contacting references and/or other sources. The Government
may also consider other information available.

Cost/Price Evaluation

      1. The cost evaluation will determine whether the proposed costs are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation
      requirements. Proposed costs must be entirely compatible with the technical proposal.


      2. The Government may use the results of cost/price realism analysis to adjust the offeror's proposal to a most probable cost to the
      Government. This may include information from a government auditing agency, Government technical personnel, and other sources.


      3. Although price/cost is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored. The degree of importance of the proposed
      price/cost will increase the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based.


      4. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest technical
      score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.

  (a) "Inspection/Acceptance." The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract.
The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require
repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If

adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights--
    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common
carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any

contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor
shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give

  (t) "Central Contractor Registration (CCR)."
    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)
      (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day's written notification of its intention to
        (A) change the name in the CCR database;
        (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
        (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with
the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR
database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.
