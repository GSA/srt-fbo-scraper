SECTION M--EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1 Project Evaluation Criteria
Award will be made to that Offeror (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is the most advantageous to the Government. Evaluation Factor's Advantages other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price in the award decision. The critical element in making any cost/technical trade-off is not solely the spread between the technical ratings, but, rather, the significance (importance) of that difference (advantage). The significance of the spread of ratings will be determined on the basis of what the difference might mean in terms of the performance and what it would cost the Government to take advantage of it. Award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and advantageous to the Government. The Offeror's proposal shall be concisely written to the evaluation criteria. Each Offeror's proposal shall be a two-part submittal. (1-Technical Part and 2-Price Part) Technical proposals will be evaluated based on the first 20 pages of the proposal. Pages beyond this amount including attachments and enclosures will not be considered. Award may be made without further discussions. Offers should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint, which the Contractor can submit to the Government. The Government may, after evaluation of proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate, with all offerors whose proposals are within the competitive range. Failure to provide all information requested by the RFP may render the proposal as unacceptable. Technical proposals shall be provided separate from the price proposal. The technical proposal will be evaluated and rated by a Technical Evaluation Panel who may have access to the price proposals. The following factors will be used in the technical evaluation process.

Technical Approach 1. Offeror's ability to illustrate their understanding of NGLVC's needs for this project, as well as their ability to expound upon those needs, will be a critical determining factor in the evaluation process 2. A concise narrative explaining how the project will move from the conceptual phase through the development phase is strongly recommended. 3. Project Management ­ Describe your ability to organize, schedule, and staff this project to completion on schedule. 4. A proposed Quality Control Plan ­ provide a complete description of your procedures that reflects quality assurance on all aspects of the required work. Experience
Offeror's proposals shall provide a brief overview of the skills and experience for the primary personnel assigned to the project. Include accurate information that will allow the evaluators to contact contract administrators involved with the referenced work. Provide names, phone numbers, dates, locations and type of work. Specifically identify Key Personnel that you will provide for the performance of this contract. Provide information about each key person's experience.

1. Introduction
These pages contain the technical specifications required to be addressed in the Offeror's proposal for providing interactivity on the Children's Forest Kiosk, located at the Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center in Ashland, Wisconsin.

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the project is to develop application programming for a stand-alone interactive kiosk for educating children using touchscreen interface and providing content back-end management for updating signage and promotional media.

1.2 Scope of Services
The kiosk application programming will field interactive media, signage, and promotional materials on a public kiosk to facilitate designation of the new Children's Forest, located at the Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center on the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin.

The following tasks, at a minimum, must be addressed in each proposal submitted: 1.2.1 Design Attract Screens and Digital Signage Loop to allow NGLVC to manage playlists for content, set schedules, running ads, sending updated news, events, info, etc. 1.2.2 Incorporate User-friendly Landing Pages. 1.2.3 Provide Client kiosk browser, OS and desktop lockdown and Server side Software for communication with the kiosk from a central server--to remotely monitor the kiosk health, retrieve kiosk usage reports, collect survey data, and push content out to the kiosk. 1.2.4 Create solutions to add functional interactive content to the Children's Forest Kiosk.

1.3 References and Technical Contact
The Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center (nglvc.org) will implement and field interactive media, signage, and promotional materials to facilitate the designation of a new Children's Forest on part of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. Educational programs at the Center are rooted in More Kids in the Woods goals. The Children's Forest Kiosk is to be a resource for inviting children, adults and families to outdoor activities through interactive learning and will enable us to better accomplish the goals of President Obama's Initiative; A 21st Century Strategy for America's Great Outdoors while accomplishing the overall goals of Kids in the Woods.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The project calls for designing programming for a touchscreen kiosk to provide interactive media, signage, and promotional media for educating children in a public visitor center, without human intervention.

2.2 Product Features
The product is to be designed for use on a Windows personal computer operating system. The kiosk user is guided step-by-step in the process of using the kiosk, through simple user interface. User interface is organized around interconnected screens, where each screen displays only currently needed information. After successfully completing task(s) on one screen, user is guided to the next. Screens are displayed in full screen format, hiding everything of underlying operating system. This is necessary because users must not interact with operating system directly, because it may lead to kiosk malfunction. The product is to be organized for a touchscreen monitor with options displayed as on-screen buttons, and a virtual (screen) keyboard, displayed when needed. First (attract) screen invites the user to interact with a dynamic attract screen displaying flash animated graphics, video clips and/or static images. Interaction with the kiosk may start by touching the screen, and visitor is directed to a user-friendly "Landing Page." Interaction with kiosk may be ended by successfully completing all the tasks, by user cancelling the process, or if there is no interaction for some predefined period of time (user walks away in the middle of the process). Taking care of its user is an important aspect for this kiosk application. The application must constantly check its own state, control all the hardware, periodically report status to its owner, immediately report all critical errors and condition.

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
The Children's Forest kiosk will be available for use for the 100,000-plus visitors that come to the Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center annually. User interface must be ADA compliant. Most of the visitors are families with children. Some are locals looking to engage their children in opportunities available at NGLVC. Others are families taking a break during their travels and looking for engaging activities before continuing on their journeys.

2.4 Operating Environment
The Children's Forest kiosk will be indoors and will have: 1 42" LCD Monitor with 16:9 Screen Ratio with Maximum Resolution of 1920 x 1200, Landscape Orientation. 1 Dell Small Form Factor Kiosk PC: IntelŽ PentiumŽ Dual Core, E5800 (3.2GHz, 2MB L2 Cache 800MHz FSB), 1GB DDR3 Non-ECC SDRAM, Integrated Video, 250GB SATA 3.0Gb/s, 8MB DataBurst Cache Hard Drive, Integrated Intel 82567LM Gigabit Network Connection, Windows 7 Professional 32-bit with Resource DVD, Optical Drive, Dell Energy Smart Power Management Settings.

2.5 User Documentation
Awarded offeror shall provide owner documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that shall be delivered along with the software. User documentation may be delivered in CD, DVD video or pdf formats.

2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
NGLVC shall provide the successful offeror with all creative art necessary for "branding" to achieve the desired look and feel for each application. The Children's Forest Kiosk will be equipped with: A wireless Internet connection to its owner, for status report and/or for content backend management requirements. An uninterruptible power supply, allowing kiosk to end its job in a regular way in case of a power shortage. All of kiosk hardware placed inside strong metal case, which protects it from harsh weather conditions and from being damaged by destructive-oriented users. The metal case coupled to the ground for those same reasons. The Children's Forest Kiosk will have no known materials, either input or output, that requires periodic maintenance (refilling printers and paper trays, taking coins, etc.)

3. Kiosk Applications Features
Offeror's proposal shall address application options available for the Children's Forest Kiosk. The Kiosk requires that the first screen invites the user to interact with a dynamic attract screen consisting of flash animated graphics, video clips and/or static images. The attract screen instructs the user to "Touch the screen to start" and welcomes the visitor to the Children's Forest with engaging video clips, or animations displaying NGLVC partners, logos, and theme of kids enjoying the outdoors. Upon touching the screen, the user is directed to a landing page (a user friendly access point) and may select from a number of featured application options.

3.1 Content Back-End Management (Required)
3.1.1 Content back-end management for posting owner-generated media for signage and promotions.
This feature of the programming allows the owner to keep messages current and relevant. Owner may post updated promotions about upcoming events, images or video clips of past events, outdoor fun (featuring seasonal suggestions e.g., blueberry picking in the Mocquah Barrens). Users can choose any of these options from a menu screen. User can advance to the screen for choosing Upcoming Events or to the screen to Review an Event, etc.

3.1.2 Content back-end management for owner's posting kid-generated media productions.

Attachment 1 Software Requirements Specification for Children's Forest Kiosk

Page 4

This feature of the programming allows the owner to post media kids created in their classrooms, clubs, or membership groups e.g., 4-H or Scout Troops, and submitted for use in the Children's Forest Kiosk. Users can choose options (the title, artist, and media) from a menu screen to view any of the pieces. User can advance to review that piece.

3.1.3 Interactivity to allow user to "Like" a featured posting.
User has an option to "vote" or "like" the reviewed pieces by touching the appropriate button. "Like" counts are tallied and the count appears in the menu screen as information about that menu choice.

3.2 Interactivity Suggestions (Option Items)
NGLVC strongly encourages Offeror's proposals to be creative throughout the developmental process. While the tasks listed under Section 1.2, Scope of Services, specify NGLVC expectations, this list is not all encompassing; rather, the purpose is to outline our minimum expectations for all proposals. Offeror's proposals shall specify options for interactivity applications and costs associated with each item. Following are only suggestions for interactivity applications. Offerors are encouraged to address these suggestions and/or provide alternative options as solutions for interactivity content.

3.2.1

Simple Matching/Memory Quizzes

Educational Identification Games: Match a graphic of flora, fauna, birds, frogs, invertebrates, etc. to the correct graphic of the place where to find it e.g., Bear tracks from a bear, acorn on an oak leaf, and pine cone with a pine tree.

3.2.2

____________________________________________________________________________________ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.59 per hour or $143.60 per week or $622.27 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;

(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that

determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
