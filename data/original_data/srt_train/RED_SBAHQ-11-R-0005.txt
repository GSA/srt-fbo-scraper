                                                          SMALL BUSINESS RESOURCE GUIDES

1.  Background and Introduction

The mission of the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is to maintain and strength the Nation’s economy by aiding, counseling, and
protecting the interests of small businesses, and by helping families and businesses recover from national disasters.  Production of SBA
National and Local Resource Guides is a highly effective way to support the SBA mission by providing information to the small business
community.

The SBA seeks to enter a no-cost contract with a publisher for the production of multiple small business resource guides on an annual basis.
The guides will include a national resource guide (National Guide), available in both English and Spanish versions.  Guides will also include
Localized Resource Guides (Local Guides) which are customized versions, tailored for use by participating SBA’s local District Offices located
across the Nation and in U.S. territories.

The Contractor shall have the ability to create, design, publish, and distribute a mutually agreed-upon number of National and Local Guides.
The minimum number of Guides to be distributed is 300,000 units a year.  SBA will designate the locations for distribution.  Distribution shall
be at Contractor’s expense.

Contractor will also create a web site that hosts the Guides.

Contractor shall partner with the SBA to create the Guides at no cost to the SBA. Within the limitations set forth herein, Contractor may sell
advertising to the Public to cover its costs and fee for creation and distribution of the Guides.

2.  Scope

Contractor shall partner with the SBA to create and distribute National and Local Guides that detail training, planning, financing, legal and
taxation requirements, contacts, and other business information useful to the small business community.  The National Guide and some Local
Guides shall have both an English and a Spanish version.

Contractor shall obtain reimbursement of its costs and fee for creation and distributions of these guides from advertising in the Guides and on
its website created for Guide distribution.

This contract will be awarded for a base year and four option years.

The SBA will have no financial liability as a result of this no-cost contract.

3.  Technical Requirements

The SBA needs strong, comprehensive documents design, publication, distribution, and marketing support to create highly usable, interesting,
useful Guides for the Nation’s small business community.  The Contractor shall engage professional researchers, designers, writers, publishers,
and other staff as necessary to develop high-quality, practical Resource Guides with useful information for new and growing small business
owners.

This SOW is performance-based.  Contractor’s proposal shall provide the solutions for creating Guides with the following minimum requirements.

3.1 SBA Small Business Resource Guide Series
The SBA requires a Resource Guide series that includes a National Guide, as    well as individual Local Guides, tailored for use by
participating SBA District   Offices.  SBA has 68 District Offices in the States, District of Columbia, Guam,    and Puerto Rico.  Specific
standards are as follows.

      3.1.1 National Guide
      • The National Guide shall be produced and printed every six months.
       • The National Guide shall provide brief descriptions of SBA’s Programs and services, and general contact information for SBA-affiliated

        Contractor and the SBA.  The agreed number shall be included in the Guide Production Plan and Schedule.
      • If a District Office exhausts its supply of Local Guides, Contractor shall deliver copies of the National Guides.  If a District Office
        desires additional copies of its Local Guide, over and above the originally negotiated number, Contractor shall provide that District
        Office with an estimate detailed the cost and fee.  Any charge will be negotiated separately from this no-cost contract as a purchaser

   life of the contract, as it deems necessary to comply with Federal law, or SBA rules and regulations.

             (i) Unless provided otherwise in paragraph (d) of this clause, the Contractor may, without prior approval of the Contracting

or 402, and an acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number).
             (iii) For data other than computer software, the Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up,
nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in such copyrighted data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public,
and perform publicly and display publicly by or on behalf of the Government. For computer software, the Contractor grants to the Government, and
others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license in such copyrighted computer software to reproduce, prepare
derivative works, and perform publicly and display publicly (but not to distribute copies to the public) by or on behalf of the Government.
         (2) Data not first produced in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall not, without the prior written permission of the
Contracting Officer, incorporate in data delivered under this contract any data not first produced in the performance of this contract unless
the Contractor—

             (ii) Grants to the Government, or acquires on its behalf, a license of the same scope as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this

    (d) Release, publication, and use of data. The Contractor shall have the right to use, release to others, reproduce, distribute, or publish
any data first produced or specifically used by the Contractor in the performance of this contract, except—
         (1) As prohibited by Federal law or regulation (e.g., export control or national security laws or regulations);
         (2) As expressly set forth in this contract; or
         (3) If the Contractor receives or is given access to data necessary for the performance of this contract that contain restrictive
markings, the Contractor shall treat the data in accordance with such markings unless specifically authorized otherwise in writing by the
Contracting Officer.
    (e) Unauthorized marking of data.
         (1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract concerning inspection or acceptance, if any data delivered under this contract
are marked with the notices specified in paragraph (g)(3) or (g) (4) if included in this clause, and use of the notices is not authorized by
this clause, or if the data bears any other restrictive or limiting markings not authorized by this contract, the Contracting Officer may at any
time either return the data to the Contractor, or cancel or ignore the markings. However, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253d, the following procedures
shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings.
             (i) The Contracting Officer will make written inquiry to the Contractor affording the Contractor 60 days from receipt of the inquiry
to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings;
             (ii) If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings
within the 60-day period (or a longer time approved in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government shall have the
right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions.
             (iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings
are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in
writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized,
the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final agency decision regarding
the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the
Contracting Officer’s decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of
the matter either by the Contracting Officer’s determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to
cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition
of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.
         (2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations
implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder.
         (3) Except to the extent the Government’s action occurs as the result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the Contractor is not precluded by paragraph (e) of the clause from bringing a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of
this contract, that may arise as the result of the Government removing or ignoring authorized markings on data delivered under this contract.
    (f) Omitted or incorrect markings.
         (1) Data delivered to the Government without any restrictive markings shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights. The
Government is not liable for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.
         (2) If the unmarked data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Contractor may request, within 6 months

52.212-02   EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1 – Technical Ability (40%)

Offeror’s proposal shall address (1) its ability to create, produce, and deliver national and local resource guides for the small business
community, meeting a similar delivery schedule to the one detailed in Attachment 3 – Sample – “SBA PRODUCTION SCHEDULE;” (2) detail of staff,
subcontractors and other resources to be used by the Offeror to produce and deliver the guides, (3) detail of existing resources (staff,
subcontractors, and other) of Offeror to work with the SBA on guide creation and delivery; (4) resources (staff, subcontractors, and other) to
sell advertising and collect revenue, and (3) resources (staff, subcontractors, and other) to publish paper guides and to create a website to
allow guides to be available on a website.  Offeror’s proposal for this section shall be in 12-point font with a limit of 10 pages.

Factor 2 – Past Performance (30%)
Offeror’s proposal shall detail its past performance for similar contracts or projects for Federal Agencies and/or private organizations in
terms of price control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Offeror shall identify Agencies/firms for which similar
services and end-products were provided within the past three (3) years, including contact information, such as names, phone numbers, and email
addresses.  Offeror is encouraged to submit samples of its publications and/or websites.  Offeror’s proposal for this section shall be in 12-
point font with a limit of 6 pages, not including any provided samples.

In addition to responses received using Offeror’s contact information, the Government reserves the right to consider information obtained from
any other sources when evaluating the Offeror’s past performance, including the Excluded Party List System (EPLS).

Factor 3 – Size Determination/Subcontracting Plan (10%)

This factor evaluates the small business opportunities of Offeror’s proposal.  If Offeror is a small business, it will receive full points for
this factor.  If Offeror is “other than a small business,” it shall submit a subcontracting plan detailing subcontracting opportunities for
small business which will be evaluated and scored.  “Small business” includes all small business categories and participants in socioeconomic
programs, as defined in FAR Part 19.

Factor 4 – Price (20%)

This factor evaluates the reasonableness of Offeror’s proposed advertising rates/prices and, as necessary, the price realism of proposed
advertising rates/prices.  The realism of proposed prices may significantly affect the final selection for award.  Offeror shall use the pricing
sheet (Attachment 4) to detail its proposed advertising rates/prices.  Offeror may format the pricing sheet to better reflect its method for
charging advertising rates/prices.  Rates/prices shall be provided for the base year and for each potential option years.  Offeror may add as
many pages to the pricing sheet as it requires.

The SBA will evaluate the rates/prices to determine to the best of its ability to determine that (1) the rates/prices are fair and reasonable to
the advertising public, and (2) the rates/prices are sufficient to support the creation and production of the guides.  Advertising rates shall
be sufficient to support all of (1) Offeror’s direct costs, (2) Offeror’s appropriately apportioned indirect costs, and (3) Offeror’s
fee/profit.


Technical ability and past performance are significantly more important than price.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO
GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American
Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer
determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.
  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—
    (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
    (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;
    (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]
    (1) Listed end products.

in the corresponding country as listed for that product.
      [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in
the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
  (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly—
    (1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds
the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
    (2) o Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with

    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify
that—
      (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or
traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of
normal business operations;
      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
      (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as
that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
    [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that—
      (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or
(k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this
information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the
Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN
provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror’s TIN.
    (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
      o  TIN: ________________________________.
      o  TIN has been applied for.
