RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Include a description of the plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ ethnic groups in the clinical trial protocol as approved by the IRB, and provide a description of the progress in the conduct of these analyses, as appropriate, in the annual progress report and the final report. If the analysis reveals no subset differences, a brief statement to that effect, indicating the subsets analyzed, will suffice. The Government strongly encourages inclusion of the results of subset analysis in all publication submissions. In the final report, the Contractor shall include all final analyses of the data on sex/gender and race/ethnicity. b. Technical Progress Reports Containing Interim Study Data 1. Legend for Technical Progress Reports Containing Interim Study Data It is recommended that the Contractor incorporate the following legend on the cover of technical progress reports and reports containing study data that are prepared for use by all working committees in their monitoring of the trial. Working committees include but are not limited to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), Steering Committee and Executive Committee. "The data, if any, contained in this report/deliverable are preliminary and may contain unvalidated findings. These data are not intended for public use. Public use of these data could create erroneous conclusions which, if acted upon, could threaten public health or safety." 2. Use of Interim Study Data Interim data used in technical progress reports and other reports developed for the purpose of study monitoring are not intended for public use. Premature release of such data could result in interpretations that prove to be unreliable or invalid once the study is completed and the full context for the data is known. Unreliable or invalid interpretations can threaten public health and safety by leading the public and medical practitioners to pursue inappropriate measures. In addition, an interpretation of the interim data that is contrary to study protocol could cause participants to drop out of treatment groups. This could prevent completion of the study. A secondary consequence, not in terms of public health and safety, but one that is important in its own right, is that premature release of the data can lead to financial loss to the Government, since any funds spent on a trial that does not answer the questions posed by the study would be devalued. In consideration of the above, interim data shall be used only for internal study monitoring purposes with the exception of publications and presentations approved in accordance with the programmatic protocol and study procedures. c. Other Reports/Deliverables 1. Information Security and Physical Access Reporting Requirements The Contractor shall submit the following reports as required by the INFORMATION AND PHYSICAL ACCESS SECURITY Article in SECTION H of this contract.

ARTICLE H.19. NHLBI GUIDELINES FOR AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN MULTICENTER CLINICAL TRIALS (9/6/2000)
In 1995, the Department released its final rule on "Objectivity in Research" (Federal Register, July 11, 1995). Under this rule, an investigator must disclose to an official in his or her institution "any Significant Financial Interests (and those of his/her spouse and dependent children) that would reasonably appear to be affected by the research proposed for funding by the PHS. The institutional official(s) will review those disclosures and determine whether any of the reported financial interests could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research and, if so, the institution must, prior to any expenditure of awarded funds, report the existence of such conflicting interests to the PHS Awarding Component and act to protect PHS-funded research from bias due to the conflict of interest." These are minimum requirements. Individual institutions may interpret them and implement them somewhat differently, and investigators may decide to go beyond them. Also, in certain circumstances, these rules may need to be adapted to the specific research program. For example, it would be reasonable for investigators in multicenter clinical trials to come up with a study-wide policy on conflict of interest, as different interpretations of the guidelines by different investigators and their institutions may be inappropriate. Certainly, the credibility of the study might depend on all of the investigators having stronger policies for conflict than are mandated by the PHS. Even if one or two of the investigators have financial interests in a drug or device being evaluated in the trial, or in a competitor of the drug or device, questions may arise as to the validity and interpretation of the trial results. An example of this is TIMI-1, where some of the investigators had considerable financial interest in tPA, leading to Congressional investigation.

- 29 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Most, but not all, clinical trial investigator groups have since developed conflict of interest guidelines. These have ranged from disclosure of interests to prohibition against buying or selling stock in a company manufacturing one of the interventions, to having any equity. In some cases, consulting or giving paid talks for the manufacturers has been discouraged. Any clinical trial assessing an intervention for which there is or might be an IND (for drugs) or an IDE (for devices) has additional requirements. Details about these requirements may be obtained from the FDA (www.fda.gov/oc/guidance/ financialdis.html.) In summary, the integrity of the study must not be compromised by financial interests. To assure that, investigators cannot have financial arrangements that reward a particular study outcome, proprietary interest in the intervention being tested, significant equity in the manufacturer of the intervention, or significant payments of other sorts. Specified financial arrangements must be disclosed. The sponsor of the IND or IDE is responsible for collecting information about financial interests. The NHLBI, even if it is not the sponsor of the IND or IDE, will take an active role in ensuring that these requirements are followed. It is in the Institute's interest to strongly advise the investigative group to develop guidelines that avoid any perception that the study design, conduct, and data analysis and interpretation might have been biased by investigator conflict. To help investigators comply with the PHS regulations, the Institute Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or Program Scientist and the Principal Investigator(s) must discuss the conflict of interest policy for the study at an early stage in the protocol development process. Although the Institute does not specify exactly what policy a given study should develop, it needs to remind the investigative group that study credibility depends on reasonably strict guidelines. These policies should be clearly spelled out in the protocol. In addition, the COR or Program Scientist should be apprised of conflicts that arise and the corrective actions by the investigator's local institution. As noted in regulations, the Institute "may at any time inquire into the Institutional procedures and actions regarding conflicting financial interests in PHS-funded research, including requirement for submission of, or review on site, all records pertinent to compliance with this subpart."

ARTICLE H.20. INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING INVESTIGATOR FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Institution (includes any contractor, public or private, excluding a Federal agency) shall comply with the requirements of 45 CFR Part 94, Responsible Prospective Contractors, which promotes objectivity in research by establishing standards to ensure that Investigators (defined as the project director or principal Investigator and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research funded under NIH contracts, or proposed for such funding, which may include, for example, collaborators or consultants) will not be biased by any Investigator financial conflicts of interest. 45 CFR Part 94 is available at the following Web site: http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=45:1.0.1.1.52&idno=45 As required by 45 CFR Part 94, the Institution shall, at a minimum: a. Maintain an up-to-date, written, enforceable policy on financial conflicts of interest that complies with 45 CFR Part 94, inform each Investigator of the policy, the Investigator's reporting responsibilities regarding disclosure of significant financial interests, and the applicable regulation, and make such policy available via a publicly accessible Web site, or if none currently exist, available to any requestor within five business days of a request. A significant financial interest means a financial interest consisting of one or more of the following interests of the Investigator (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) that reasonably appears to be related to the Investigator's institutional responsibilities: 1. With regard to any publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure and the value of any equity interest in the entity as of the date of disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000. Included are payments and equity interests; 2. With regard to any non-publicly traded entity, a significant financial interest exists if the value of any remuneration received from the entity in the twelve months preceding the disclosure, when aggregated, exceeds $5,000, or when the Investigator (or the Investigator's spouse or dependent children) holds any equity interest; or 3. Intellectual property rights and interests, upon receipt of income related to such rights and interest. - 30 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Significant financial interests do not include the following: 1. Income from seminars, lectures, or teaching, and service on advisory or review panels for government agencies, Institutions of higher education, academic teaching hospitals, medical centers, or research institutes with an Institution of higher learning; and 2. Income from investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, as long as the Investigator does not directly control the investment decisions made in these vehicles. b. Require each Investigator to complete training regarding the Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy prior to engaging in research related to any NIH-funded contract and at least every four years. The Institution must take reasonable steps [see Part 94.4(c)] to ensure that investigators working as collaborators, consultants or subcontractors comply with the regulations. c. Designate an official(s) to solicit and review disclosures of significant financial interests from each Investigator who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the NIH-funded research. d. Require that each Investigator who is planning to participate in the NIH-funded research disclose to the Institution's designated official(s) the Investigator's significant financial interest (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) no later than the date of submission of the Institution's proposal for NIHfunded research. Require that each Investigator who is participating in the NIH-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution during the period of the award as well as within thirty days of discovering or acquiring a new significant financial interest. e. Provide guidelines consistent with the regulations for the designated official(s) to determine whether an Investigator's significant financial interest is related to NIH-funded research and, if so related, whether the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest. An Investigator's significant financial interest is related to NIH-funded research when the Institution, thorough its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest: Could be affected by the NIH-funded research; or is in an entity whose financial interest could be affected by the research. A financial conflict of interest exists when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research. f. Take such actions as necessary to manage financial conflicts of interest, including any financial conflicts of a subcontractor Investigator. Management of an identified financial conflict of interest requires development and implementation of a management plan and, if necessary, a retrospective review and mitigation report pursuant to Part 94.5(a). g. Provide initial and ongoing FCIO reports to the Contracting Officer pursuant to Part 94.5(b). h. Maintain records relating to all Investigator disclosures of financial interests and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosures, and all actions under the Institution's policy or restrospective review, if applicable, for at least 3 years from the date of final payment or, where applicable, for the other time periods specified in 48 CFR Part 4, subpart 4.7, Contract Records Retention. i. Establish adequate enforcement mechanisms and provide for employee sanctions or other administrative actions to ensure Investigator compliance as appropriate. j. Complete the certification in Section K - Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors titled "Certification of Institutional Policy on Financial Conflicts of Interest". - 31 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 If the failure of an Institution to comply with an Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy or a financial conflict of interest management plan appears to have biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research, the Institution must promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the corrective action taken or to be taken. The Contracting Officer will consider the situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the NIHfunded research project. The Contracting Officer and/or HHS may inquire at any time before, during, or after award into any Investigator disclosure of financial interests, and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosure, regardless of whether the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interests.. The Contracting Officer may require submission of the records or review them on site. On the basis of this review of records or other information that may be available, the Contracting Officer may decide that a particular financial conflict of interest will bias the objectivity of the NIH-funded research to such an extent that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution has not managed the financial conflict of interest in accordance with Part 94.6(b). The issuance of a Stop Work Order by the Contracting Officer may be necessary until the matter is resolved. If the Contracting Officer determines that NIH-funded clinical research, whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment, has been designed, conducted, or reported by an Investigator with a financial conflict of interest that was managed or reported by the Institution, the shall require the Investigator involved to disclose the financial conflict of interest in each public presentation of the results of the research and to request an addendum to previously published presentations.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION a. INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION [FAR Provision 52.215-1 (January 2006)] (a) Definitions. As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing", "writing", or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. - 44 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (2) The first page of the proposal must show-(i) The solicitation number; (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available); (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the - 45 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals.

(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. (8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data (e.g., commercial information, financial information, cost and pricing data); and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following statements, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted: "Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), data contained in the portions of this proposal which the offeror has specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that HHS may not be able to withhold a record (e.g. data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the HHS's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if HHS has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information - 46 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages ( insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)." (2) In addition, the offeror must mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: - 47 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection; (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. (End of Provision) Alternate I (October 1997).As prescribed in 15.209(a)(1), substitute the following paragraph (f)(4) for paragraph (f)(4) of the basic provision: (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. b. NAICS CODE AND SIZE STANDARD Note: The following information is to be used by the offeror in preparing its Representations and Certifications (See Section K of this RFP), specifically in completing the provision entitled, SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REPRESENTATION, FAR Clause 52.219-1. 1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712. 2. The small business size standard is 500 employees. THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS. However, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires in every solicitation, (except for foreign acquisitions) the inclusion of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and corresponding size standard which best describes the nature of the requirement in the solicitation. c. TYPE OF CONTRACT AND NUMBER OF AWARDS 1. It is anticipated that one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) award will be made from this solicitation and that the award will be made on/about October 3, 2013. 2. It is anticipated that the award from this solicitation will be an IDIQ with a Period of Performance of seven years and will not include options to extend the term of the contract. The resulting Task Orders may be Cost-Reimbursement Completion or Fixed Price Completion. Each Cost-Reimbursement Completion Task Order will include a ceiling amount. Furthermore, each Task Order will be fully funded at the time of award.

- 48 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 3. A Task Order for Task Area One will be awarded concurrently with the IDIQ. Additionally, a separate Task Order will be awarded concurrently for the first year of Task Area Two. These two Task Orders will represent the minimum quantity. 4. FAR 16.301-3 limits use of any contract type, other than firm-fixed price, to a contractor whose accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. To be considered for an award under this solicitation, the Offeror is required to certify, in its Business Proposal, the adequacy of its accounting system. See the paragraph entitled, Adequate Accounting System in Section L.2. Business Proposal Instructions in this solicitation for additional information about this certification. d. TASK ORDERS UNDER A SINGLE AWARD INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT a. General The Contractor will be required to provide services under the resultant contract only in performance of task orders and modifications to task orders signed by the Contracting Officer. Costs not attributed to the performance of a specific task order shall not be allowed without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor will commence performance upon the receipt of a Task Order signed by the Contracting Officer. Costs for the preparation of Task Order proposals shall not be reimbursed as a direct cost under the resultant contract. One or more task orders may be issued during the performance period of the resultant contract. If the contractor responds to a Task Order Request for Proposal (TORFP) and successfully receives a task order, that Contractor will be required to accept and perform the task order issued by the Contracting Officer within the scope of the resultant contract. The government has no obligation to issue any task orders, beyond the minimum identified in SECTION B of the contract. In the event of any inconsistency between any task order and the contract, the contract shall control. The competition requirements in FAR Part 6, and the policies in FAR Subpart 15.3, DO NOT APPLY to the task ordering process. For each requirement under the resultant contract, the Contracting Officer shall: 1. Issue a notice of intent to award a task order for services to the resultant Contractor within a technical area covered by the task order requirement. To satisfy this requirement, the Contracting Officer will provide an email notifying the Contractor of the requirement. The e-mail will identify the details concerning the requirement, including a description of the work and selection criteria, will be provided, i.e. attached to the e-mail, posted on a website. The Contractor will be asked to submit a response to the notice of intent, advising the government of their intent to submit a proposal or quote; 2. Consider price and cost under each order as one of the factors in the selection decision; 3. Keep submission requirements to a minimum; 4. Consider past performance on earlier task orders under this contract to the maximum extent possible. Past performance considerations shall include, but not be limited to, the Contractor's performance regarding completeness, accuracy, clarity, timeliness and cost control. If a Contractor has no past performance on any earlier task order, past performance will be considered through other sources, such as the Contractor's original proposal. b. Requesting Task Order Proposals The Contracting Officer or a designated individual may solicit responses to requirements from the Contractor within a technical area covered by a task order requirement in writing. A Task Order Request for Proposals (TORFP) will be prepared and issued for each task order requirement. All contract clauses contained in the resultant IDIQ contract shall be incorporated in the TORFP and the resultant task order. If conflicts exist between the contract clauses and the information outlined in the task order, the resultant contract language takes precedence over the information in the task order.

- 49 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01

c. Ordering Process The Contractor will receive an e-mail notification advising of the availability of each proposed task order requirement. All proposed task orders will incorporate all terms of the resultant IDIQ contract unless otherwise specified in the proposed task order. The Contractor will be provided an adequate time to prepare and submit a response based on the Contracting Officer's consideration of the estimated dollar value and complexity of the proposed task order. The response will not be considered a proposal as defined in FAR Part 15. However, the Contractor shall provide information sufficient for consideration in accordance with FAR Part 16. Each TORFP will indicate the criteria for the evaluation of the proposal. The response shall demonstrate capability for each criterion to be evaluated. Generally, the Contractor will be asked to demonstrate the following as appropriate: 1. Understanding of the requirement; 2. Experience and capability on similar tasks; 3. Technical approach, methods and procedures for satisfying the requirements with a discussion of potential problems to be encountered and proposed solutions and/or risk mitigation strategies. 4. Procedures for assuring quality of work, products, and deliverables; 5. Plan for managing the task order, including meeting requirements and schedules, and performance measures (if applicable); 6. Staffing plan with skill levels and level of effort for each individual proposed. Generally, resumes will be required for proposed personnel (if not previously submitted); 7. References to evaluate past performance; and 8. Cost/Price to perform the task order. d. Evaluation and Award of Task Order Proposals The Government will evaluate each Task Order proposal against the requirements of the TORFP. Specifically, the technical evaluation factors, cost/price, past performance and any other factor specifically identified in the TORFP will be used for evaluation of each proposal. Generally, technical factors will be significantly more important than price and other factors. However, each TORFP will specify how the award decision will be made. Upon completion of an evaluation and negotiations, the Contracting Officer may issue a task order to the Contractor. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing. e. COMMITMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with the proposed procurement. Any other commitment, either explicit or implied, is invalid. f. PROMOTING EFFICIENT SPENDING On September 21, 2011, the Office of Management and Budget issued Memorandum M-11-35, entitled, "Eliminating Conference Spending and Promoting Efficiency in Government," emphasizing the President's priority to ensure that the Government operates with the utmost efficiency and eliminates unnecessary or wasteful spending. This was followed by the Executive Order on Delivering an Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Government ( EO 13576) and the Executive Order on Promoting Efficient Spending ( EO 13589). On January 3, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) issued the memorandum "HHS Policy on Promoting Efficient Spending: Use of Appropriated Funds for Conferences and Meetings, Food, Promotional Items, and Printing, and Publications" (See http://www.hhs.gov/asfr/ogapa/acquisition/ effspendpol_memo.html). In support of these directives, the NIH issued a January 30, 2012, Memorandum, entitled, "NIH Guidance Related to the HHS Policies on Promoting Efficient Spending: Use of Appropriated Funds for Conferences, - 50 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Conference Grants and Meetings, Food, Promotional Items, and Printing and Publications." (See http:// oamp.od.nih.gov/) Any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation will: ˇ Specifically prohibit the use of contract funds for the provision of food for meals, light refreshments and beverages for any NIH funded meeting or conference; and ˇ Limit the procurement of meeting space, promotional items, printing and publications. g. COMMUNICATIONS PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD Offerors shall direct all communications to the attention of the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer cited on the face page of this RFP. Communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in cancellation of the requirement. h. RELEASE OF INFORMATION Contract selection and award information will be disclosed to offerors in accordance with regulations applicable to negotiated acquisition.

If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract - 54 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 1. Communications will be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range. 2. The Contracting Officer will, in concert with program staff, decide which proposals are in the competitive range. The competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals. Oral or written discussions will be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. While it is NHLBI's policy to conduct discussions with all offerors in the competitive range, NHLBI reserves the right, in special circumstances, to limit the number of proposals included in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition. All aspects of the proposals are subject to discussions, including cost, technical approach, past performance, and contractual terms and conditions. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range shall be given an opportunity to submit a written Final Proposal Revision (FPR) with the reservation of the right to conduct finalization of details with the selected source in accordance with HHSAR 315.370. e. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 will be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. f. The NHLBI reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP. In addition, the RFP may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet NHLBI's requirements. Synopses of awards exceeding $25,000 will be published in FedBizOpps. 13.

Human Subjects IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following subparagraphs shall be addressed, as applicable, in a SEPARATE SECTION of the Technical Proposal entitled, "HUMAN SUBJECTS." a. Notice to Offerors of Requirements of 45 CFR Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects, HHSAR 352.270-4(a) (January 2006) a. Copies of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations for the protection of human subjects, 45 CFR Part 46, are available from the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The regulations provide a systematic means, based on established ethical principles, to safeguard the rights and welfare of individuals who participate as subjects in research activities supported or conducted by the HHS. b. The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The regulations extend to the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable human subjects as well as to graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable human subjects. The use of autopsy materials is governed by applicable State and local law and is not directly regulated by 45 CFR Part 46. c. Activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 45 CFR 46.101(b)(1-6) are exempt from coverage. d. Inappropriate designations of the noninvolvement of human subjects or of exempt categories of research in a project may result in delays in the review of a proposal. The Government's Project Officer will make a final determination of whether the proposed activities are covered by the regulations or are in an exempt category, based on the information provided in the proposal. In doubtful cases, the Project Officer will consult with OHRP. e. In accordance with 45 CFR Part 46, prospective Contractors being considered for award shall be required to file with OHRP an acceptable Assurance of Compliance with the regulations, specifying review procedures and assigning responsibilities for the protection of human subjects. The initial and continuing review of a research project by an institutional review board shall assure that: the rights and welfare of the human subjects involved are adequately protected; the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to both the potential benefits, if any, to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained; and informed consent will be obtained by methods that are adequate and appropriate.

Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that women and members of minority groups and their sub-populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research projects involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the relevant Institute/Center Director that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. The Director, NIH, may determine that exclusion under other circumstances is acceptable, upon the recommendation of an Institute/Center Director, based on a compelling rationale and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources. Women of childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43), and applies to research subjects of all ages. All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the UPDATED "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research, Amended October 2001," published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001 at the following web site: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm These guidelines contain a definition of clinical research adopted in June 2001, as: "(1) Patient-oriented research. Research conducted with human subjects (or on material of human origin such as tissues, specimens and cognitive phenomena) for which an investigator (or colleague) directly interacts with human subjects. Excluded from this definition are in vitro studies that utilize human tissues that cannot be linked to a living individual. Patient-oriented research includes (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) therapeutic interventions, (c) clinical trials, and (d) development of new technologies; (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies; and (3) Outcomes research and health services research." Information Required for ALL Clinical Research Proposals This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the offeror's plans for inclusion of women and minorities in the research proposed; or (2) the offeror's justification(s) for exclusion of one or both groups from the research proposed.

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Provide information on the composition of the proposed study population in terms of sex/ gender and racial/ethnic groups and provide a rationale for selection of such subjects in response to the requirements of the solicitation. The description may include (but is not limited to) information on the population characteristics of the disease or condition being studied in the planned research, and/or described in the statement of work, national and local demography, knowledge of the racial/ethnic/cultural characteristics of the population, prior experience and collaborations in recruitment and retention of the populations and subpopulations to be studied, and the plans, arrangements and letters of commitment from relevant community groups and organizations for the planned research. The proposal must include the following information: ˇ A description of the subject selection criteria ˇ The proposed dates of enrollment (beginning and end) ˇ A description of the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as subjects ˇ A compelling rationale for proposed exclusion of any sex/gender or racial/ethnic group NOTE 1: If this is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) or Requirements contract as defined in FAR 16.5, the proposal should describe in general terms how it will comply with each bulleted item above for each task order. When the Government issues a task order request for proposal, each of the bulleted information items must be fully and specifically addressed in the proposal. Standards for Collecting Data. When you, as a contractor, are planning data collection items on race and ethnicity, you shall use, at a minimum, the categories identified in OMB Directive No. 15. The collection of greater detail is encouraged. However, you should design any additional, more detailed items so that they can be aggregated into these required categories. Self-reporting or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. When you collect race and ethnicity separately, you must collect ethnicity first. You shall offer respondents the option of selecting one or more racial designations. When you collect data on race and ethnicity separately, you shall also make provisions to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. When you present aggregate data, you shall provide the number of respondents who selected only one category, for each of the five racial categories. If you collapse data on multiple responses, you shall make available, at a minimum, the total number of respondents reporting "more than one race." Federal agencies shall not present data on detailed categories if doing so would compromise data quality or confidentiality standards. In addition to the above requirements, solicitations for NIH defined Phase III clinical trials * require that: a) all proposals and/or protocols provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm, Definitions - Significant Difference). *The definition of an " NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trial" can also be found at this website.) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable; and b) all contractors to report annually cumulative subject accrual, and progress in conducting analyses for sex/gender and race/ethnicity differences. Offerors may obtain copies of the Updated Guidelines from the sources above or from the contact person listed in the solicitation. - 64 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Also, the proposal must include one of the following plans: ˇ Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, the Government has determined that the work required by this solicitation does not involve a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. Therefore, the NIH believes that the inclusion of women and minority populations is appropriate for this project. (See Section M of this RFP for more information about evaluation factors for award.) Use the form entitled, "Inclusion Enrollment Report," for reporting in the resultant contract. e. Inclusion of Children in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that children (defined below) must be included in all human subjects research, including, but not limited to, clinical trials, conducted under a contract funded by the NIH, unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. (See examples of Justifications for Exclusion of Children below). For the purposes of this policy, contracts involving human subjects include categories that would otherwise be exempt from the DHHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (sections 101(b) and 401(b) of 45 CFR 46), such as surveys, evaluation of educational interventions, and studies of existing data or specimens that should include children as participants. This policy applies to both domestic and foreign research contracts. For purposes of this policy, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. All offerors proposing research involving human subjects should read the "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research Involving Human Subjects" which was published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on March 6, 1998 and is available at the following URL address: http://www.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-024.html Offerors also may obtain copies from the contact person listed in the RFP. Inclusion of children as participants in research must be in compliance with all applicable subparts of 45 CFR 46 as well as other pertinent laws and regulations whether or not such research is otherwise exempted from 45 CFR 46. Therefore, any proposals must include a description of plans for including children, unless the offeror presents clear and convincing justification for an exclusion. The "Human Subjects" section of your technical proposal should provide either a description of the plans to include children and a rationale for selecting or excluding a specific age range of child, or an explanation of the reason(s) - 65 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 for excluding children as participants in the research. This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the plans for including children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research; and/or (2) the justification of exclusion of children or exclusion of a specific age range of children. When children are included, the plan also must include a description of: (1) the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included; (2) the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children; and, (3) the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Justifications for Exclusion of Children It is expected that children will be included in all research involving human subjects unless one or more of the following exclusionary circumstances can be fully justified: ˇ The objective of the solicitation is not relevant to children.
o

There are laws or regulations barring the inclusion of children in the research to be conducted under the solicitation. The knowledge being sought in the research is already available for children or will be obtained from another ongoing study, and an additional study will be redundant. You should provide documentation of other studies justifying the exclusion. A separate, age-specific study in children is warranted and preferable. Examples include: - The relative rarity of the condition in children, as compared with adults (in that extraordinary effort would be needed to include children); or - The number of children is limited because the majority are already accessed by a nationwide pediatric disease research network; or - Issues of study design preclude direct applicability of hypotheses and/ or interventions to both adults and children (including different cognitive, developmental, or disease stages of different age-related metabolic processes); or - Insufficient data are available in adults to judge potential risk in children (in which case one of the research objectives could be to obtain sufficient adult data to make this judgment). While children usually should not be the initial group to be involved in research studies, in some instances, the nature and seriousness of the illness may warrant their participation earlier based on careful risk and benefit analysis; or - Study designs aimed at collecting additional data on pre-enrolled adult study subjects (e.g., longitudinal follow-up studies that did not include data on children); - Other special cases justified by the offeror and found acceptable to the review group and the Institute Director Definition of a Child For the purpose of this solicitation, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. The definition of child described above will pertain to this solicitation (notwithstanding the FDA definition of a child as an individual from infancy to 16 years of age, and varying definitions employed by some - 66 -

o

o

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 states). Generally, State laws define what constitutes a "child," and such definitions dictate whether or not a person can legally consent to participate in a research study. However, State laws vary, and many do not address when a child can consent to participate in research. Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46, subpart D, Sec.401-409) address DHHS protections for children who participate in research, and rely on State definitions of "child" for consent purposes. Consequently, the children included in this policy (persons under the age of 21) may differ in the age at which their own consent is required and sufficient to participate in research under State law. For example, some states consider a person age 18 to be an adult and therefore one who can provide consent without parental permission. Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects a. HHS Regulations at 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart C provide additional protections pertaining to biomedical and behavioral research involving prisoners or those individuals who, during the period of the contract become prisoners, as subjects. These regulations also set forth the duties of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) where prisoners are involved in the research. HHS funded research involving prisoners as subjects may not proceed until the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) issues approval, in writing, as required by 45 CFR 46.306(a)(2). In addition, OHRP Guidance on the Involvement of Prisoners in Research may be found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/prisoner.pdf. b. HHS Waiver for Epidemiological Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects On June 20, 2003 the Secretary of HHS waived the applicability of certain provisions of Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 46, (Additional DHHS Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects) to specific types of epidemiological research involving prisoners as subjects. The applicability of 45 CFR 46.305(a)(1) and 46.306(a)(2) for certain epidemiological research conducted or funded by DHHS is waived when: 1. The sole purposes are: a. to describe the prevalence or incidence of a disease by identifying all cases, or b. to study potential risk factor associations for a disease, and 2. The Institution responsible for the conduct of the research certifies to the OHRP that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the research and fulfilled its duties under 45 CFR 46.305(a)(2 7) and determined and documented that: a. the research presents no more than minimal risk, and b. no more than inconvenience to the prisoner subjects, and c. prisoners are not a particular focus of the research. For more information about this Waiver see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/special/ prisoners/Prisoner waiver 6-20-03.pdf f. Research Involving Human Fetal Tissue Human Fetal Tissue means tissue or cells obtained from a dead human fetus, including human embryonic stem cells, human pluripotent stem cells and human embryonic germ cells. - 67 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 The governing federal statute is the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g 1 and 289g 2. Implementing regulations and guidance for conducting research on human fetal tissue may be found at 45 CFR 46, Subpart B and http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/ not93-235.html and any subsequent revisions to this NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts ("Guide") Notice. By signing the face page of the proposal, the offeror (authorized institutional official) certifies that researchers using human fetal tissue are in compliance with 42 USC 289g 2. This statute specifically prohibits any person from knowingly acquiring, receiving, or transferring any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. "Valuable consideration" is a concept similar to profit, and does not include reasonable payment for costs associated with the collection processing, preservation, storage, quality control or transportation of these tissues. Research involving the transplantation of human fetal tissue must be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local law. g. Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (including Human Gene Transfer Research) Recombinant DNA Molecules are either 1) molecules that are constructed outside of living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or 2) DNA molecules that result from the replication of those described in 1). All research involving recombinant DNA molecules that is conducted at or sponsored by an entity that receives any support for recombinant DNA research from NIH shall be conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines) (See http://oba.od.nih.gov/rdna/nih_guidelines_oba.html). The NIH Guidelines stipulate biosafety and containment measures for recombinant DNA research and delineate points to consider in the development and conduct of human gene transfer clinical trials, including ethical principles and safety reporting requirements (See Appendix M of the Guidelines). More information about compliance with the NIH Guidelines can be found in a set of Frequently Asked Questions at: http://oba.od.nih.gov/ rdna_ibc/ibc_faq.html. The NIH Guidelines apply to both basic and clinical research studies. Prior to beginning any clinical trials involving the transfer of recombinant DNA to humans, the trial must be registered with the NIH OBA and reviewed by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). If this contract involves new protocols that contain unique and/or novel issues, the RAC may recommend that the protocol also be discussed by the RAC in a public forum. Approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) are necessary before the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and Contracting Officer may approve the protocol prior to the start of the research. The IBC approval may not occur before the NIH RAC has concluded its review of the protocol. Failure to comply with the NIH Guidelines may result in suspension, limitation, or termination of the contract for any work related to recombinant DNA research or a requirement for Contracting Officer prior approval of any or all recombinant DNA projects under this contract. This includes the requirements of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) ( See http://oba.od.nih.gov/rdna_ibc/ibc.html). As specified in Appendix M-1-C-4 of the NIH Guidelines, any serious adverse event that that is both unexpected and associated with the use of the gene transfer product (i.e., there is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the use of the product) must be reported to the NIH OBA and IBC within 15 days, or within 7 days if the event was life-threatening or resulted in a death. A copy of the report must also be filed with the COR and Contracting Officer (See http://oba.od.nih.gov/oba/rac/guidelines_02/ APPENDIX_M.htm). Such reports must also be submitted within their mandated time - 68 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 frames to the IRB, Food and Drug Administration, and, if applicable, the HHS Office for Human Research Protections. h. Human Embryonic Germ Cell (HEGC) Research 1. Guidelines. Research use of human embryonic germ cells derived from fetal tissue with Federal funds requires review of compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells ( http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/guidelines.asp) (only the information regarding human embryonic germ cells is relevant). Embryonic germ cells are pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos. See NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Notice NOT OD 02 049, requiring that offerors/contractors submit certain documents to the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG), which will be reviewed in a public meeting. Research using human embryonic germ cells may not be performed prior to approval by the HPSCRG. All offerors should read the "NIH Guidelines" ( http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/ guidelines.asp) if they either: (1) propose to respond to the Statement of Work requirements by conducting research that uses human embryonic germ cells or, (2) are responding to a Statement of Work that requires the use of human embryonic germ cells. Offerors may obtain copies of these Guidelines from the website above or from the contact person listed in this solicitation. 2. Procedure for Required Review by Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) If the offeror intends to fulfill the requirements of the Statement of Work by performing research using human embryonic germ cells, it must so state in its proposal. If the offeror's proposal includes research using human embryonic germ cells and it receives a contract award, the Contractor may not perform any research using these human embryonic germ cells until the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) has reviewed and approved the documentation furnished as prescribed in "Procedures for Submission of Compliance Documents to the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) for the Research Use of Human Embryonic Germ Cells" ( http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-049.html) and the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor of the approval in writing. The resultant contract will be divided into discrete Task Areas. During Task Area Three of the contract, the Contractor shall submit the original and two copies of the required documentation and assurances that address the areas covered in "Procedures for Submission of Compliance Documents to the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) for the Research Use of Human Embryonic Germ Cells," at: (http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice files/NOT OD 02 049.html) to the Contracting Officer. This documentation will be forwarded for review and approval to the HPSCRG. If the HPSCRG disapproves the documentation presented by the Contractor, the Contracting Officer may elect to either terminate the contract in accordance with the Termination for Convenience clause of the contract OR determine not to exercise subsequent option(s) as appropriate based the terms of the specific contract. Otherwise, when the HPSCRG approves the documentation, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing that research using the human embryonic germ cells may commence. - 69 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Research involving the use of human embryonic germ cells shall not be conducted under the contract until the HPSCRG review and approval have been obtained, and the Contracting Officer has provided written notice of such approval to the Contractor. i. Human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC) Research On March 9, 2009, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 13505: Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells. The NIH has published Guidelines on Human Stem Cell Research at: http://stemcells.nih.gov/ policy/2009guidelines.htm. The Guidelines implement EO 13505 with regard to extramural NIH-funded stem cell research, establish policy and procedure under which the NIH will fund such research, and help ensure that NIH-funded research in this area is ethically responsible, scientifically worthy, and conducted in accordance with applicable law. Specific eligibility requirements for NIH funding of hESCs are included in Section II, Eligibility of Human Embryonic Stem Cells for Research with NIH Funding. Ineligible sources and uses of hESCs are addressed in Section IV, Research Using hESCs and/or Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells That, Although the Cells May Come from Eligible Sources, is Nevertheless Ineligible for NIH Funding, and Section V, Other Research Not Eligible for NIH Funding. To facilitate research using human embryonic stem cells, the NIH has established a Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry ("the NIH Registry") that lists the human embryonic stem cells that are currently eligible for use in NIH-funded research. This registry is available at: http://stemcells.nih.gov/registry/. Proposed human embryonic stem cell line(s) must be on the NIH Registry at the time of proposal submission. Any possible changes to the proposed cell line must be discussed in the proposal. Offerors wishing to have Human Embryonic Stem Cell Lines added to the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry must submit the request on Form NIH 2890 through the following website: http:// hescregapp.od.nih.gov/NIH_Form_2890_Login.htm. Research involving the derivation of new stem cells from human embryos or the use of human embryonic stem cells that are not listed on the NIH Registry may not be conducted with Federal funding. j. Data and Safety Monitoring in Clinical Trials All offerors are directed to the full text of the NIH Policies regarding Data and Safety Monitoring and Reporting of Adverse Events that are found in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Announcements at the following web sites: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not99-107.html http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-038.html All offerors receiving an award under this solicitation must comply with the NIH Policy cited in these NIH Announcements and any other data and safety monitoring requirements found elsewhere in this solicitation. The following is a brief summary of the Data and Safety Monitoring and Adverse Event Reporting Requirements: Data and Safety Monitoring is required for every clinical trial. Monitoring must be performed on a regular basis and the conclusions of the monitoring reported to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The type of data and safety monitoring required will vary based on the type of clinical trial and the potential risks, complexity and nature of the trial. A plan for data and safety monitoring is required for all clinical trials. A general description of a monitoring plan establishes the overall framework for data and safety monitoring. It should describe the - 70 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 entity that will be responsible for the monitoring, and the policies and procedures for adverse event reporting. Phase III clinical trials generally require the establishment of a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The establishment of a DSMB is optional for Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. The DSMB/Plan is established at the time the protocol is developed and must be approved by both the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Government and in place before the trial begins. If the protocol will be developed under the contract awarded from this solicitation, a general description of the data and safety monitoring plan must be submitted as part of the proposal and will be reviewed by the scientific review group (Technical Evaluation Panel, (TEP)) convened to evaluate the proposal. If the protocol is developed and is included as part of the submitted proposal, a complete and specific data and safety monitoring plan must be submitted as part of the proposal. Monitoring Plans, at a minimum, must include the prompt reporting of adverse events to the IRB, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Also, in the plan you should describe the frequency of reporting of the conclusions of the monitoring activities. The overall elements of each plan may vary depending on the size and complexity of the trial. The NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html describes examples of monitoring activities to be considered. The frequency of monitoring will depend upon potential risks, complexity, and the nature of the trial; therefore a number of options for monitoring trials are available. These can include, but are not limited to, monitoring by a: ˇ Principal Investigator (required) ˇ Independent individual /Safety Officer ˇ Designated medical monitor ˇ Internal Committee or Board with explicit guidelines ˇ Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB - required for multisite trials) ˇ Institutional Review Board (IRB - required) For multi-site Phase I and Phase II trials, a central reporting entity that will be responsible for preparing timely summary reports of adverse events for distribution among sites and IRBs should be considered. Organizations with a large number of clinical trials may develop standard monitoring plans for Phase I and Phase II trials. In this case, such organizations may include the IRBapproved monitoring plan as part of the proposal submission. k. Registration of and Results Reporting for Applicable Clinical Trials in ClinicalTrials.gov The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) at: http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi? dbname=110_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ085.110.pdf,Title VIII, expands the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) clinical trials registry and results database known as ClinicalTrials.gov ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) and imposes new requirements that apply to certain applicable clinical trials, including those supported in whole or in part by NIH funds. FDAAA requires: a. The registration of certain "applicable clinical trials" in ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after the first subject is enrolled; and - 71 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01

b. The reporting of summary results information (including adverse events) no later than 1 year after the completion date for registered applicable clinical trials involving drugs that are approved under section 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act, biologics, or of devices that are cleared under section 510k of FDCA. The resultant contract will support one or more applicable clinical trial subject to FDAAA. The "responsible party" is the entity responsible for registering and reporting trial results in ClinicalTrials.gov. ˇ Where the Contractor is the IND/IDE holder, the Contractor will be considered the Sponsor, therefore the "Responsible Party." ˇ Where there is no IND/IDE holder or where the Government is the IND/IDE holder, the Government will generally be considered the "Sponsor" and may designate the contractor's Principal Investigator (PI) as the "Responsible Party." ˇ For Multi-Center trials where there is no IND/IDE holder or where the Government is the IND/IDE holder, the "Responsible Party" will be designated at one site (generally the lead clinical site) and all other sites will be responsible for providing necessary data to the "Responsible Party" for reporting in the database. Additional information is available at http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov 5. Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources As a public sponsor of biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a dual interest in accelerating scientific discovery and facilitating product development. Intellectual property restrictions can stifle the broad dissemination of new discoveries and limit future avenues of research and product development. At the same time, reasonable restrictions on the dissemination of research tools are sometimes necessary to protect legitimate proprietary interests and to preserve incentives for commercial development. To assist NIH contractors achieve an appropriate balance, the NIH has provided guidance in the form of a two-part document, consisting of Principles setting forth the fundamental concepts and Guidelines that provide specific information to patent and license professionals and sponsored research administrators for implementation. The purpose of these Principles and Guidelines is to assist NIH funding recipients in determining: 1) Reasonable terms and conditions for making NIH-funded research resources available to scientists in other institutions in the public and private sectors (disseminating research tools); and 2) Restrictions to accept as a condition of receiving access to research tools for use in NIH-funded research (acquiring research tools). The intent is to help recipients ensure that the conditions they impose and accept on the transfer of research tools will facilitate further biomedical research, consistent with the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act and NIH funding policy. This policy, entitled, "Sharing Biomedical Research Resources: Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts," (Federal Register Notice, December 23, 1999 [64 FR 72090] will be included in any contract awarded from this solicitation. It can be found at the following website: http://ott.od.nih.gov/pdfs/64FR72090.pdf a. Sharing Research Data [Note: This policy applies to all NIH contracts, regardless of dollar value, that are expected to generate research data.] - 72 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 The NIH endorses the sharing of final research data to expedite the translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. This contract is expected to generate research data. Therefore, the offeror must submit a plan in its technical proposal for data sharing or state why data sharing is not possible. If data sharing is limited, the offeror should explain such limitations in its data sharing plan. NIH's data sharing policy may be found at the following Web site: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html If the resultant contract is part of a collaborative program involving multiple sites, the data sharing will be governed by a dissemination plan to be developed jointly following award. Offerors must include in their proposals a statement of willingness to work collaboratively after award with the other funded sites to prepare a joint dissemination plan. Coordinating Center proposals should describe methods to coordinate the dissemination planning and implementation. The Coordinating Center must include a budget and justification for any additional costs of this collaborative effort. 6. Information and Physical Access Security is applicable to this solicitation and the following information is provided to assist in proposal preparation. IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following information shall be addressed in a separate section of the Technical Proposal entitled "Information Security." The Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 and the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) (FISMA) requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to safeguard information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor (including subcontractor), or other source. A. HHS-Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security a. To perform the work specified herein, Contractor personnel are expected to have routine (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) physical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data or information, whether in an HHS-controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3). b. To gain routine physical access to an HHS-controlled information system, and/ or access to sensitive data or information, the Contractor and its employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget Memorandum (M-05-24); and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201; and with the personal identity verification and investigations procedures contained in the following documents: 1.

As later information comes into your possession, it should be submitted promptly to the Contracting - 87 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 Officer in a manner that clearly shows how the information relates to the offeror's price proposal. The requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data continues up to the time of agreement on price, or an earlier date agreed upon between the parties if applicable. b. By submitting your proposal, you grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine records that formed the basis for the pricing proposal. That examination can take place at any time before award. It may include those books, records, documents, and other types of factual information (regardless of form or whether the information is specifically referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing) that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price. 3. Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other than Certified Cost or Pricing Data, FAR Clause 52.215-20 (October 2010) (a) Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data. (1) In lieu of submitting certified cost or pricing data, offerors may submit a written request for exception by submitting the information described in the following subparagraphs. The Contracting Officer may require additional supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether an exception should be granted, and whether the price is fair and reasonable. (i) Identification of the law or regulation establishing the price offered. If the price is controlled under law by periodic rulings, reviews, or similar actions of a governmental body, attach a copy of the controlling document, unless it was previously submitted to the contracting office. (ii) Commercial item exception. For a commercial item exception, the offeror shall submit, at a minimum, information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition.

In addition, describe the nature of the market; (C) For items included on an active Federal Supply Service Multiple Award Schedule contract, proof that an exception has been granted for the schedule item. (2) The offeror grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before award, books, records, documents, or other directly pertinent records to verify any request for an exception under this provision, and the reasonableness of price. For items priced using catalog or market prices, or law or regulation, access does not extend to cost or profit information or other data relevant solely to the offeror's determination of the prices to be offered in the catalog or marketplace. (b) Requirements for certified cost or pricing data. If the offeror is not granted an exception from the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data, the following applies: - 88 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 (1) The offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data, data other than certified cost or pricing data, and supporting attachments in accordance with the instructions contained in Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408, which is incorporated by reference with the same force and effect as though it were inserted here in full text. The instructions in Table 15-2 are incorporated as a mandatory format to be used in this contract, unless the Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree to a different format and change this clause to use Alternate I. (2) As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before contract award (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts), the offeror shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2. (End of provision) Alternate I (October 2010) of FAR Clause 52.215-20, Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data Other than Cost or Pricing Data (October 2010). As prescribed in 15.408(l)(and see 15.403-5(b)(1)), substitute the following paragraph (b)(1) for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic provision: (b)(1) The offeror shall submit certified cost or pricing data, data other than certified cost or pricing data, and supporting attachments in the following format: The format specified in paragraph L.2.c.4. Certified Cost or Pricing Data, subparagraph 3. formats for Submission of Line Item Summaries shall be used for the submission of cost data. Submission of all other certified cost or pricing data shall be in accordance with Table 15-2 in FAR 15.408. 4. Salary Rate Limitation in Fiscal Year 2012 Offerors are advised that pursuant to P.L. 112-74, no NIH Fiscal Year 2012 (October 1, 2011 September 30, 2012) funds may be used to pay the direct annual salary of an individual through any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation at a rate in excess of the Executive Schedule, Level II* (direct salary is exclusive of Overhead, Fringe Benefits and General and Administrative expenses, also referred to as "indirect cost" or "facilities and administrative (F&A) costs"). Direct salary has the same meaning as the term "institutional base salary." An individual's direct salary (or institutional base salary) is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care or other activities. Direct salary (or institutional base salary) excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. This does not preclude the offeror from absorbing that portion of an employee's annual salary (plus the dollar amount for fringe benefits and associated indirect costs) that exceeds a rate of the Executive Schedule, Level II*. The salary rate limitation set by P.L 112-74 applies only to Fiscal Year 2012 funds, however, salary rate ceilings for subsequent years may be included in future DHHS appropriation acts. Multi-year contracts awarded pursuant to this solicitation may be subject to unilateral modifications by the Government if an individual's annual salary exceeds any salary rate ceiling established in future appropriations acts. The Executive Schedule, Level II* annual salary rate limitation also applies to individuals proposed under subcontracts, however it does not apply to consultants. P.L. 112-74 states: "None of the funds appropriated in this title shall be used to pay the salary of an individual through a grant or other extramural mechanism, at a rate in excess of Executive Level II."

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 The Department of Commerce determines, on an annual basis, by Subsectors, as contained in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and region, if any, the authorized SDB procurement mechanisms and applicable factors (percentages). The NAICS codes can be found at: http://www.sba.gov/size The Department of Commerce website for the annual determination for NAICS codes* is: http://www.acquisition.gov/References/sdbadjustments.htm. * Note: Public Law 103-355 which authorized the SDB Price Evaluation Adjustment (PEA) and associated percentages/factors expired on December 9, 2004, therefore, the percentages shown at this website are no longer applicable. Offerors shall include with their offers, SDB targets, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract value, in each of the applicable, authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s). The applicable authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s) for this project is (are) identified elsewhere in this RFP. A total target for SDB participation by the Prime Contractor, that includes any joint ventures and team members, shall be provided as well as a total target for SDB participation by subcontractors. In addition, offerors must provide information that describes their plans for meeting the targets set forth in their proposal. This information shall be provided in one clearly marked section of the Business Proposal, which shall describe the extent of participation of SDB concerns in the performance of the contract. If the evaluation factor in this solicitation includes an SDB evaluation factor or subfactor that considers the extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified, the SDB concerns considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any resultant contract. Offerors should note that addressing the extent of small disadvantaged business participation is not in any way intended to be a substitute for submission of the subcontracting plan, if it is required by this solicitation. An example of the type of information that might be given (in addition to the narrative describing the plan for meeting the targets) follows: EXAMPLE Targets for SDB Participation - NAICS Industry Subsector 223

RFP Number : NHLBI-HR-14-01 9. Total Compensation Plan a. Instructions 1. Total compensation (salary and fringe benefits) of professional employees under service contracts may, in some cases, be lowered by recompetition of these contracts. Lowering of compensation can be detrimental in obtaining the necessary quality of professional services needed for adequate performance of service contracts. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR Part 541, be properly compensated in these contracts. All offerors as a part of their Business Proposal will submit a "Total Compensation Plan" (salaries and fringe benefits) for these professional employees for evaluation purposes. 2. The Government will evaluate the Total Compensation Plan to ensure that this compensation reflects a sound management approach and an understanding of the requirements to be performed. It will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted work of high quality. The total compensation proposed will be evaluated in terms of enhancing recruitment and retention of personnel and its realism and consistency with a total plan for compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits). 3. Evaluation for award, therefore, will include an assessment of the Total Compensation Plan submitted by each offeror. b. Evaluation 1. Total Compensation Plan (Professional Employees) In establishing compensation levels for professional employees, the total compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits) proposed shall reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the work to be accomplished and the suitability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and retain qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must recognize the distinct differences in professional skills and the complexity of varied disciplines as well as job difficulty. Proposals offering total compensation levels less than currently being paid by the predecessor Contractor for the same work will be evaluated, in addition to the above, on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted work of high quality, and availability of required competent professional employees. Offerors are cautioned that instances of lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may be considered a lack of sound management judgment in addition to indicating a lack of understanding of the requirement. 2. Cost (Professional Compensation) Proposals which are unrealistically low or do not reflect a reasonable relationship of compensation to the professional job categories so as to impair the Contractor's ability to recruit and retain competent professional employees, may be viewed as reflecting a failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements. The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. The compensation data required will be used in evaluation of the offeror's understanding of the contract requirements. 3. Other (Labor Relations) An assessment of the potential for adverse effect upon performance and maintenance of the required number of professional employees with requisite skills resulting from an unrealistically low compensation structure will also be made. 4. Federal Acquisition Regulation Clauses incorporated by Reference

Exception may be granted to provide Government property (Government-furnished or Contractor-acquired), but only when approved by the Contracting Officer. If the offeror requests that Government property be provided, other than that specified under "Government Furnished Property," below , the proposal must include a comprehensive justification addressing the following items: a. State why the property is essential to contract performance and whether the property will be used exclusively for this contract. b. Describe other alternatives (e.g., purchase, lease, etc.) pursued and why they were not viable options. 2. Government Property The offeror shall identify Government property in its possession which it proposes to use in the performance of the prospective contract as follows: a. A list or description of all Government property that the offeror or its subcontractors propose to use on a rent-free basis. The list shall identify the accountable contract under which the property is held and the authorization for its use (from the Contracting Officer having cognizance of the property); b. The dates during which the property will be available for use (including the first, last, and all intervening months) and, for any property that will be used concurrently in performing two or more contracts, the amounts of the respective uses in sufficient detail to support prorating the rent; c. The amount of rent that would otherwise be charged in accordance with FAR 52.245-9, Use and Charges; and d. A description of the offeror's property management system, plan, and any customary commercial practices, voluntary consensus standards, or industry-leading practices and standards to be used in the offeror in managing Government property. NOTE: The Contracting Officer will consider any potentially unfair competitive advantage that may result from an offeror or contractor possessing Government property. This will be done by adjusting the offers by applying, for evaluation purposes only, a rental equivalent evaluation factor, as specified in FAR 52.245-9.

Financial Capacity The offeror shall indicate if it has the necessary financial capacity, working capital, and other resources to perform the contract without assistance from any outside source. If not, indicate the amount required and the anticipated source. d. Adequate Accounting System FAR Part 16 sets forth the requirements and limitations for consideration of contract type.

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 SECTION A - BACKGROUND INFORMATION This Request for Proposal (RFP) is for a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for a new National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) (PETAL Network). The Network will consist of one CCC solicited under RFP NHLBI-HR-14-01 and approximately eleven Clinical Centers (CCs) to be solicited under RFP NHLBI-HR-14-03. The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials to prevent, treat, and/or improve the outcome of patients with or at risk for ALI. More than one trial will be conducted simultaneously and it is expected that 3-5 trials will be completed during the course of the contract. Evidence suggests that ALI can be prevented or its severity reduced with early intervention, and treatment of established ALI is sure to benefit from earlier treatment. Despite important progress in disease management in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the mortality remains high and long term consequences from critical illness and ALI are serious and debilitating. Studies that emphasize prevention and attempts at earlier intervention are needed. It will also be the role of this Network to collect samples that will permit measurement of the molecular phenotype of patients throughout the course of their injury, from development to recovery. The Network will function by a Steering Committee (SC) of principal investigators from the CCs, the CCC, and the NHLBI. There will be an Executive Committee consisting of a subset of Network committee chairs, the SC chair, the CCC, and the NHLBI. Regular consultation with the wider critical care community will be organized by the CCC and/or NHLBI to establish research priorities. The SC will then collaboratively prioritize, develop, and conduct the clinical trials. Protocols developed by the Network will be reviewed by an independent Protocol Review Committee (PRC) chosen by and reporting to the NHLBI. Conduct of the trials shall be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) chosen by and reporting to the NHLBI. The CCC will be led by a statistician and a critical care physician both with experience in large, complex clinical trials in critically ill patients. Each CC will include two co-principal investigators (co-PIs) from one institution consisting of clinician-investigators representing (1) the ICU and (2) another clinical investigator, such as an emergency department clinician, hospitalist or other with early access to patients at risk for lung injury. The CCs shall also include at least one other institution that will participate in enrollment and study conduct but not Network leadership. Each CC will be expected to enroll a total of 220 subjects over 5 ˝ years of a sevenyear project. The CCC shall be responsible for coordination of all aspects of the Network, including statistical design and analysis of trials, development of standard operating procedures to ensure high quality, efficient, confidential automated data collection, entry, timeliness of Institutional Review Board (IRB) submissions, report preparation, development and maintenance of public and private web sites, and coordination of all Network meetings and committees. The CCC will also be responsible for planning, collecting, and storing high quality biospecimens that can be used to do longitudinal molecular phenotyping (i.e., samples over the course of the illness development and recovery) in future studies that will be funded by other mechanisms. The CCC will be expected to assist the Network to develop an efficient IRB review process that can reduce redundancy and improve timeliness, while maintaining safety.

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS a. General Description of the Program and Desired Results The objective of this solicitation is to establish a multi-disciplinary Network that can develop and conduct multi-center clinical studies to evaluate promising therapies and approaches for preventing and/or treating ALI. This treatment/prevention Network, NHLBI Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) will be expected to develop and conduct multiple clinical research studies (mostly trials) that can be run in parallel. The Network will consist of approximately eleven Clinical Centers (CC)s, each with at least one other site that will assist with recruiting, and a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC). Each CC will have two principal investigators from one institution that represent (1) an intensive care unit/pulmonary clinician-investigator and (2) another clinical investigator, such as an emergency department clinician, with early access to patients at risk for lung injury. Each CC must include at least one satellite medical center for recruiting critically ill patients. Each CC will be expected to enroll at least 40 subjects per year for 5.5 years. Research conducted by this Network should utilize the most modern and flexible electronic data collection, transfer, decision support, and monitoring. Biospecimens will be collected from patients during the course of the development and recovery of lung injury and sent to the CCC core laboratory. These specimens will be archived for future use for studies in molecular phenotyping of patients; funds from non-network sources will be needed for these studies. Members of the PETAL Network will be encouraged to participate in a collaborative IRB program to reduce the time and redundancy of protocol approvals and monitoring. As this is developed, the CCC will be responsible for communication with this group. The CCC will coordinate all aspects of the research, including development of protocols, management and analysis of data, and assurance of data quality. The CCC will be responsible for collecting and archiving biospecimens during the contract, and depositing the specimens in the NHLBI biorepository at the end of studies. b. Background Information This solicitation builds on the demonstrated strengths and experience of the NHLBI Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Clinical Trial Network (ARDSnet), but shifts the focus towards earlier intervention, prevention, multidisciplinary collaborations, and new partnerships and approaches. Mortality from acute lung injury and ARDS remains high despite evidence of improving survival. There are no effective pharmacologic treatments, and as survival improves, concerns about longer term sequelae are increasing. Patients who survive acute lung injury and ARDS suffer debilitating long term consequences that include physical, cognitive, and social impairments, and an ongoing need for care, leading to decreased quality of life for patients and additional burden for caregivers. Inevitably, the aging of the American population will increase the demand for ICU care. The goal of this new initiative will be very different from the current ARDSnet. Numerous observational studies suggest that acute lung injury and ARDS can be prevented and outcomes improved in patients at risk of, but without established disease. Recommendations from the critical care community stress using multidisciplinary approaches and studies of pre-ICU factors that will permit early identification and intervention in the emergency department or other locations within the hospital. This new initiative will require a collaborative team approach that will bring together Page 10 of 29

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 pulmonary/critical care investigators, with experts in other relevant specialties including, but not limited to, emergency department physicians, perhaps experts in trauma, sepsis, and infectious disease medicine. There are several new strategies that might prove beneficial in reducing the burden of acute lung injury. New FDA guidelines for testing novel combination therapies in serious illnesses open new possibilities for early intervention and prevention of acute lung injury. There may be novel treatment opportunities emerging through increasing understanding of the lung microbiome and the role of the host response in initiating, maintaining, and resolving lung injury. Acute lung injury has several etiologies, and it is unknown whether different at-risk patients (for example patients with sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, or trauma) develop the same degree or type of lung injury, or whether treatments can be tailored and targeted to individual patients to either alleviate or prevent acute lung injury and ARDS from developing. Initial studies of regenerative medicine approaches, such as using stem cell therapies, may be ready for testing in larger studies by this Network. Ventilation and blood transfusions strategies or changes in antibiotic management may need to be applied to early intervention of acute lung injury. Although the focus of this program is on prevention and early treatment of acute lung injury, high priority studies of novel strategies for treating established acute lung injury and ARDS will be permissible. There are remaining questions regarding treatment strategies for acute lung injury and ARDS for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) that may need systematic study. Studies that could optimize treatments for ALI of different etiologies would be appropriate. Answering many of these important questions will require forming multidisciplinary collaborations and early intervention and prevention studies that are a requirement of this new program. In order to support early intervention and prevention studies, each clinical center must include a pulmonary/critical care or intensivist partnered with an emergency department physician (ED) or other hospital based clinician-investigators (e.g., rapid-response teams or hospitalists) that will enable early identification of appropriate patients. Because most patients in the ICU are supported by mechanical ventilation, critical care remains a signature area of interest for NHLBI. Each year in the United States, there are an estimated 800,000 hospitalizations involving mechanical ventilation, including 200,000 cases of acute lung injury and ARDS. In addition, there are an estimated 700,000 cases of sepsis, the most seriously ill of whom have shock or ARDS. Care for these critical illnesses remains largely supportive in the ICU as there are now no approved pharmacological treatments. ICU care is costly, nearly $7,000-$10,000/day and accounts for at least 13% of all hospital costs and 1% of the Gross Domestic Product. The goal of this new program is to conduct efficacy studies that will investigate strategies of reducing this tremendous burden through early intervention, cross discipline collaborations, and testing of novel interventions. The scope of the PETAL Network will include patients at risk for acute lung injury including patients with shock or respiratory failure from sepsis. There will be latitude to address important issues concerning risk or established critical illness, as long as the question has some relevance to heart, lung, and blood diseases. The focus will be on early treatment and/or prevention, but high priority studies of novel treatment strategies for treating established acute lung injury and ARDS in ICU patients will be within the scope of this program. Particularly important observational studies may be permitted.

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 Clinical centers will be responsible for collecting high quality biospecimens that will permit the longitudinal molecular analysis of disease pathogenesis and recovery as well as disease stratification in critically ill patients. This collection of high quality samples will permit coordinated measurement of proteins, gene expression or metabolomics will be a resource that would rapidly be made available to the wider critical care research community. In general, these samples will be available for mechanistic work conducted under other funding mechanisms. Samples will be stored at a central laboratory repository at the CCC or at a subcontractor to the CCC. Efficiencies in the conduct of clinical trials will be encouraged including conduct of factorial studies, co-enrolling patients in multiple studies where possible, and use of Phase II/III clinical trial designs. New models of trial design will be encouraged including use of Bayesian methods, new adaptive designs, and use of decision support tools. The participating institutions will be asked to cooperate in a collaborative Institutional Review Board to facilitate protocol review and approval. Observational data may be collected when a high scientific priority is identified. The PETAL Network may also be tasked with developing protocols in response to National emergencies that result in critical illness. To assure selection of significant studies, the PETAL Network investigators will work with the CCC and the wider ICU community to establish study prioritization. NHLBI may convene independent expert advisory panels to review Network progress and to evaluate protocol prioritization. In order to determine and design the highest priority studies and to obtain community input, the first year will be spent in developing the first trial or multiple trials. c. Detailed Description of Technical Requirements The CCC is expected to be experienced and highly competent in the coordination of complex studies involving critically ill patients. The CCC shall work with PIs from the CCs and a representative of the NHLBI to form a Steering Committee (SC) that serves as the governing body of the PETAL Network. The PI of the CCC shall have demonstrated expertise in biostatistics and clinical trial design and conduct in critically ill patients. The CCC shall have a co-investigator with demonstrated experience in clinical trials in critically ill patients and certified and actively involved in the care and study of pulmonary and critically ill patients, especially ALI. The co-investigator shall support the PI in managing and directing the PETAL Network. The CCC shall have a key role in trial design, oversight, and monitoring, data collection, data integrity, reporting, and PETAL Network operations. The CCC in cooperation with the NHLBI shall organize occasional conferences with the broader critical care community to discuss priorities in clinical trials. The first conference shall be held during Task Order 001. The PI of the CCC shall provide leadership in statistical issues including the design of trial protocols and analysis of trial data. The CCC shall develop plans for 1) randomization of subjects, 2) preparation and distribution of protocols, manuals and forms, 3) data collection, quality, completeness, confidentiality, and analysis, 4) training of the CCC and the CC staff in implementing protocols and data entry, 5) methods to audit site data accuracy and quality, 6) preparing and reporting of data and protocols to the SC, PRC and DSMB, 7) coordinating drug blinding and distribution as necessary, 8) assisting with the development of efficient IRB reviews by the many CCs, 9) monitoring content of and IRB approval of informed consent forms, 10) assisting in preparation of final manuscripts of primary studies, 11) coordinating communications among the CCs and scheduling conference calls and meetings of trial committees, as needed, 12) organizing (and PIs will attend) meetings of the PRC and DSMB, and 13) be experienced in working with the FDA to obtain approvals for new drugs and/or devices.

The specimen collection specifics shall be planned at the time of protocol development. The biospecimens should permit molecular phenotyping according to the most current methods, but could include all elements of blood sample preparation, possibly urine and lung/airway lavage material. The clinical centers must be provided kits and training in sample collection. Expertise in high quality sample collection should be documented. A proposal for a sample collection scheme that would support phenotyping could include, cell and sample preservation, types of measurements to support, such as DNA expression, metabolomics, markers of inflammation or other cell injury markers, etc. The CCC shall be responsible for leading the CCs in development of a more efficient IRB review process. This could be a collaborative IRB, a central IRB or some other method that will increase efficiency of trial reviews while maintaining safety and quality. d. PETAL Network Organization and Committees The PETAL Network will consist of the following groups in the organizational structure. The CCC will be responsible for managing all Network committees. a) NHLBI Program Team The Program Office will be located in the Division of Lung Diseases, NHLBI. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will be responsible for the oversight of the scientific conduct and administration of this Network. Other NHLBI team members will include other support staff from the Lung Biology and Disease Program Branch staff, personnel from the Office of Biostatistics Research, and a contract specialist and/or a contracting officer from the Office of Acquisitions. b) Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) The Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) will be responsible for the overall management of the PETAL Network, development of operational and analytical methodology, reporting and monitoring of participating clinical sites. c) Clinical Centers (CC) Approximately eleven clinical centers are anticipated in this Network. Each clinical center will be responsible for timely recruitment and clinical care quality in accordance with the PETAL Network protocols. Centers will be permitted to subcontract to satellite sites to achieve recruitment goals. There will be at least two centers within each CC - the main site and at least one other recruitment site. The co-PIs from the 11 main clinical centers will contribute substantially to the trials' scientific leadership and operational management. CC co-PIs will participate in Steering Committee and other investigator meetings. CCs will collect data at the local level in accordance with the trial protocols and the manuals of operational procedures, transmission of data to the CCC, and will manage each participant's treatment. d) Biospecimen Core The CCC will be responsible for collection of high quality biospecimens and storage until each clinical trial is completed. This may be a subcontract to the CCC. Upon completion of

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 recruitment, samples will be transferred to the NHLBI Biospecimen Repository. The biospecimen core will be responsible for providing expertly advice to the SC on the scientific potential and proper collection techniques for biospecimen procurement appropriate to develop molecular phenotypes of the critically ill patients under study. The Core will prepare and mail kits and have experience in collecting and tracking high quality samples. e) Steering committee and subcommittees The Steering Committee (SC) will provide scientific leadership for the PETAL Network. The voting members of the SC will be the CCC Principal Investigator and CCC co-PI (1 vote), the NHLBI COR, the co-PIs of the 11 clinical centers (each center 1 vote), and the SC Chair. SC members will participate collaboratively and will fully accept and implement all decisions of the SC and the Executive Committee. The SC chair will be appointed by the NHLBI and may be from within or external to the PETAL Network. The SC will meet via teleconference at least monthly. Semiannual in-person SC meetings are anticipated, in Chicago, IL. During Task 001, additional meetings may be necessary. Several subcommittees of the CCC and CC PIs and the CC coordinators appointed by the SC, will be established to make recommendations to the SC. The chairs of the subcommittees will be appointed by the SC. These will be determined by the SC and will include, at a minimum, committees for each protocol, publications, ancillary studies, ethics and conflict of interest oversight, and Network recruitment review and improvement. f) Executive Committee The Executive Committee (EC) will oversee the day-to-day operations of the PETAL Network as an extension of the SC to ensure efficient and quality performance. The EC will include chairs of the protocol committees, the SC chair, the CCC, and NHLBI. Recommendations made by the EC will be presented to the full SC for approval. g) Protocol Review Committee NHLBI will appoint an independent PRC to review and recommend protocols prior to implementation. h) Data and Safety Monitoring Board NHBLI will establish an independent DSMB to monitor data and oversee participant safety per NHLBI's Data and Safety Monitoring Policy http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/policies/dsmpolicy.htm).

Cost Proposal Excel Workbook SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD 1. GENERAL Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on evaluation of proposals against the following factors in order of importance: technical (which encompasses experience), past performance, cost/price, and Small Disadvantages Business (SDB) participation. The technical proposal will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the contractor for this acquisition. All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price. The Government reserves the right to utilize the trade-off process described in FAR 15.101-1. This process permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced or highest technically rated proposal. In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of offerors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the Request for Proposal (RFP). The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed evaluation criteria/factors listed below.

OTHER EVALUATION CRITERIA a. Cost/Price Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. Cost Realism: The specific elements of each offeror(s) proposed costs are realistic when the proposed cost elements are evaluated and found to: 1) be realistic for the work to be performed; 2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and 3) be consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror(s) technical proposal. Cost Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost to perform the contract in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost realism analysis will be considered in making the best value tradeoff decision. b. Past Performance Offerors' past performance information will be evaluated prior to establishment of the competitive range. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Page 21 of 29

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. c. Data Sharing Plan The offeror's plan for the sharing of final research data shall be assessed for appropriateness and adequacy. If your proposal does not include a plan or if the plan in your proposal is considered "unacceptable," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify your data sharing plan during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your data sharing plan is still considered "unacceptable" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. d. Evaluation of Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility ­ Section 508 The offeror's proposal must demonstrate compliance with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194 for all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports. If your proposal does not include a completed HHS "Section 508 Product Assessment Template" (hereafter referred to as the "Template") which demonstrates that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, or, if the completed "Template" included in your proposal is considered "noncompliant," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify the "Template" during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your "Template" is still considered "noncompliant" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. e. Human Subjects Evaluation This research project involves human subjects. NIH Policy requires: 1. Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks The offeror's proposal must address the involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation. If you claim that this research should be considered exempt from coverage by the Federal Page 22 of 29

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 Regulations at 45 CFR 46, the proposal should address why you believe it is exempt, and under which exemption it applies. The reviewers will evaluate the proposal with regard to four issues: Risks to Human Subjects, Adequacy of Protection Against Risks, Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others, and Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained. See Section L for a complete discussion of what is required to be addressed for each of these issues. Based on the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., concerns are identified as to the protections described against risk to human subjects or no discussion is found regarding protections against risk to human subjects) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the protection of human subjects from research risks is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. 2. Women and Minorities Women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be included in the study population of research involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification are provided indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. In addition, for NIHDefined Phase III clinical trials, all proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm , Definitions - Significant Difference) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable, unless the Government has specified that this solicitation involves a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. The proposal also must include one of the following plans:  Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups (representation of sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups as subject selection criterion is not required; however, inclusion and analyses are encouraged), OR Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup)

Page 23 of 29

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Also, the proposal must address the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as participants. Reviewers will consider the areas covered here and in Section L of the solicitation in narrative form in their evaluation. Some of the issues they will evaluate include: o o whether the plan proposed includes minorities and both genders in adequate representation how the offeror addresses the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in the development of a proposal that is appropriate to the scientific objectives of the solicitation the description of the proposed study populations in terms of sex/gender and racial/ethnic groups and the rationale for selection of such subjects if exclusion is proposed, that the rationale is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or to the purpose of the research. In addition, for gender exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if it is because:  the purpose of the research constrains the offeror's selection of study participants by gender (e.g., uniquely valuable stored specimens or existing datasets are single gender; very small numbers of subjects are involved; or  overriding factors dictate selection of subjects); or  gender representation of specimens or existing datasets cannot be accurately determined, and this does not compromise the scientific objectives of the research. For minority group exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if those minority groups are excluded because:  inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to their health; or  inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research. For NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials, reviewers will also consider whether there is an adequate description of plans to conduct analyses to detect significant differences of clinical or public health importance in intervention effect(s) by sex/gender and/or racial ethnic subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is expected in the primary analyses, or if there is an adequate description of plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is not expected in the primary analyses.

If you determine that inclusion of women and minority populations is not feasible, you must submit a detailed rationale and justification for exclusion of one or both groups from the study population with the technical proposal. The Government will review the rationale to determine if it is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or the purpose of the research

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 Based on the evaluation of the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed gender/minority inclusion plans, or concerns are identified as to the gender or minority representation, or the proposal does not adequately address limited representation of one gender or minority; or the plan is not in accordance with NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of women/minorities inclusion. If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion/exclusion of women and minorities is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. 3. Children Children (i.e. individuals under the age of 21) must be included in all human subject research unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. This Network will not include pediatric ICUs or studies. Your proposal must include a description of plans for including children. If you plan to exclude children from the required research, your proposal must present an acceptable justification for the exclusion. If you determine that exclusion of a specific age range of child is appropriate, your proposal must also address the rationale for such exclusion. Also, the plan must include a description of the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included, of the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children, and the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Also, see Section L of the solicitation for further specific requirements on inclusion of children. Based on the reviewers' evaluation of the offeror's response, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed inclusion plans for children; or concerns are identified as to the offeror's response regarding the inclusion of children; or the plan is not in accordance with h NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion of children is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award.

Clinical Trials Research Network for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Attachment 1 Acute Lung Injury (PETAL Network) Clinical Coordinating Center, RFP No. NHLBI-HR-14-01 4. Data and Safety Monitoring The offeror's proposal must include a general description of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for all clinical trials (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/policies/dsmpolicy.htm). The principles of data and safety monitoring require that all biomedical and behavioral clinical trials be monitored to ensure the safe and effective conduct of human subjects research, and to recommend conclusion of the trial when significant benefits or risks are identified or if it is unlikely that the trial can be concluded successfully. Risks associated with participation in research must be minimized to the extent practical and the method and degree of monitoring should be commensurate with risk. Additionally, all plans must include procedures for adverse event reporting. Finally, generally, for Phase III clinical trials, the establishment of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is required. The reviewers will rely on the Statement of Work and Section L in the solicitation, as well as any further technical evaluation factors in this Section M, as applicable, for the solicitation's specific requirements for data and safety monitoring. As a part of the evaluation for proposals, the reviewers will consider the acceptability of the proposed data and safety monitoring plan with respect to the potential risks to human participants, complexity of study design, and methods for data analysis. Based on the evaluation of the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., concerns are identified as to the adequacy of the monitoring plan or no discussion can be found regarding the proposed monitoring plans) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for data and safety monitoring is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. f. Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation SDB participation will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall commitment and realism of the offeror's SDB Participation targets will be used in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered to offer the best value to the Government. The extent of the offeror's Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Targets will be evaluated before determination of the competitive range. Evaluation of SDB participation will be assessed based on consideration of the information presented in the offeror's proposal. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform. Offers will be evaluated on the following sub-factors: Page 26 of 29

II. Cost Accounting Standards--Eligibility for Modified Contract Coverage If the offeror is eligible to use the modified provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and elects to do so, the offeror shall indicate by checking the box below. Checking the box below shall mean that the resultant contract is subject to the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause in lieu of the Cost Accounting Standards clause. [ ] The offeror hereby claims an exemption from the Cost Accounting Standards clause under the provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and certifies that the offeror is eligible for use of the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause because during the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted, the offeror received less than $50 million in awards of CAS-covered prime contracts and subcontracts. The offeror further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE (December 1994) Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee. The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds. The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed. Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity. By submission of its signed offer, the offeror/contractor (for acquisitions) or applicant/grantee (for grants) certifies that the submitting organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act. The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.
