                                  Biosciences Library SOW for Online Access to Science and Engineering Resources


1.0 Background and Purpose

The FDA Biosciences Library is currently receiving online web-access to science and engineering resources through Knovel Corporation.  FDA
scientists need access to scientific and engineering resources to improve their research; stay informed on changes regarding FDA regulated
products; and better serve the public.

1.1 Definitions:

Unlocked Access:
Unlocked access is a premium offered by Knovel Corporation where an unlimited number of Authorized users may access the Licensed Products at any
one time, despite the number of users authorized under the applicable license agreement.

Please Note: Knovel monitors, collects statistics of FDA's usage in an unlocked environment, and submits statistic reports to the Bioscience
Librarian.  The FDA currently has 1 unlocked user license for all subject areas, when more than 1 FDA user accesses the system Knovel documents
the occurrence as a "turn-away".  If FDA receives 50 turnaways or more in three months in any subject area, the FDA may be required to purchase
an additional user license for that subject area or move into locked status (only the number of authorized users may have access at one time).

Unlimited:
24/7 from any location within the FDA Network

2.0 General Requirements:

FDA requires an Unlimited / Unlocked Online User License for 12 months to the following science and engineering subject areas (see attachment
for a detailed list of resources offered under each subject):

      1. Biochemistry, Biology & Biotechnology,
      2. General Engineering & Engineering Management,

                3.  Pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and toiletries
          4.  Safety & Industrial  Hygiene                                                                                                    5.
      Nanotechnology,
      6. Premium Content Subject Area: Patty’s Toxicology,                                                                            7. Premium
      Content Subject Area: Sax’s Dangerous Properties, and                                                           8. Premium Content Subject
      Area: Merck Index

Due to the high amount of usage the FDA requires 2 Unlimited / Unlocked User Licenses for the following subject areas:

      1. Chemistry & Chemical Engineering
      2. Food Science

   2. Specific Requirements

      a.    Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website and connectivity issues via phone and e-mail from 8:30 to 5:30 EST and
        the capability to conduct live chats.
      b.    Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources and must be able to search both all and selected resources with one
        query.
      c.    The contractor shall set up a profile and password for all FDA users, enabling them access to the licensed resources from any
        location within the FDA Network.  Each profile shall at a minimum, have the ability to set preferences, save searches, create folders,
        and email links to content.
      d.    The user interface shall include a Graph Equations Table search that retrieves numeric and other tabular data from the resources,
        allowing the user to extract precise items of interest.
The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access issues as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as
defined above.


3.2  Deliverables:

1. The contractor shall provide a Profile and Password for all FDA users within 24 hours of receiving FDA User Names and FDA User email
addresses.

2. The contractor shall identify plug-in or additional software required or recommended on the pricing sheet (Attachment 3) and provide an
explanation in the Notes and Assumption section as to why it would be beneficial to the Government to purchase additional plug-in and/or
software .
3.  The contractor shall provide usage statistics on a monthly basis.  The usage statistics are provided either via email or contractor provided
login and should include session count, search count and total document retrievals per title.

4. The contractor shall provide online tutorials on how to access resources and use their website.

4.  Period of Performance

1/1/2011 to 12/31/2011

5. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
The following Section 508 standards are applicable to this requirement (See Clause).

§ 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.


§ 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
