SECTION 3 ­ DESCRIPTIONS/SPECIFICATIONS The services described in this purchase order have been determined to be non-personal in nature. 3.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION The Program Support Center (PSC), a component of the Assistant Secretary for Administration within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provides a wide range of administrative support services to the Department of Health and Human Services, allowing the Department's Operating Divisions to focus on their core functional and operational objectives. PSC offers more than forty products and services to HHS and other Federal government entities across the nation. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principle agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The Chief Technology Officer for HHS leads innovation activities for the Department. The Chief Technology Officer is responsible for creating a culture of innovation internal to HHS and leading the HHS Innovation agenda external to HHS. Current initiatives include:
ˇ

Health Data Initiative - HHS and the Institute of Medicine have launched a national initiative to help consumers and communities get more value out of the Nation's wealth of health data. Activities under the Health Data Initiative include the liberation of data, connecting data producers to IT developers, the Health Data Initiative Forum and support of the Health Data Affiliates. Innovation Fellows Program - HHS has begun exploring ways to bring entrepreneurial spirit to provide fresh, innovative approaches to agencies. HHS already has the strong assets and the leadership to create and develop new products; the Innovation Fellows Program aims to bring external ideas and expertise into HHS's own innovation process and rapidly create, develop, engage and accelerate innovation. HHSinnovates - The HHSinnovates program was created as part of our Open Government efforts to celebrate innovation by employees of HHS. Challenges & Competitions - Challenges and competitions are high-risk, high-reward policy tools that can foster collaboration and participation in government activities through the process of co-creation. As an inducement of participation, challenges and competitions may offer a variety of "prizes", including cash, recognition, or the deployment of a winning solution. mHealth Initiative - To explore ways to leverage innovative technology for public health, HHS has embarked on several mobile health (mHealth) initiatives that show great promise. HHS formed the Text4Health Task Force which wrote recommendations to guide HHS' strategic development of health text messaging and accelerate the growth of mHealth and health innovation.

The Chief Technology Officer is seeking the development of a new website on a WordPress platform that will provide a user driven experience that will act as a platform for engagement and education of the HHS innovation initiatives.

US General Services Administration (GSA) Section 508 Web site: http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm 7.7 NON-PERSONAL SERVICES AND INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS

Pursuant to FAR 37.1, no personal services shall be performed under this contract. All work requirements shall flow only from the COR to the Contractor's Project Manager. No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by the Government. All employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable Contractor supervisor. If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action. Pursuant to FAR 7.5, the Contractor shall not perform any inherently governmental actions under this contract. No Contractor employee shall hold him or herself out to be a Government employee, agent, or representative. No Contractor employee shall state orally or in writing at any time that he or she is acting on behalf of the Government. In all communications with third parties in connection with this contract, Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractor employees and specify the name of the company for which they work. In all communications with other Government Contractors in connection with this contract, the Contractor employee shall state that they have no authority to in any way change this contract and that if the other Contractor believes this communication to be a direction to change their contract, they shall notify the Contracting Officer for that contract and not carry out the direction until a clarification has been issued by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall insure that all of its employees working on this contract are informed of the substance of this article. Nothing in this article shall limit the Government's rights in any way under the other provisions of this contract, including those related to the Government's right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this contract. The substance of this article shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier. 7.8. a. HHS-CONTROLLED FACILITIES AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY To perform the work specified herein, Contractor personnel are expected to have routine (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data or information, whether in an HHScontrolled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3).

b.

To gain routine physical access to an HHS facility, logical access to an HHS-controlled information system, and/or access to sensitive data or information, the Contractor and its employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget memorandum (M-05-24); and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201; and with the personal identity verification and investigation procedures contained in the following documents: 1. HHS Information Security Program Policy. http://www.hhs.gov/read/irmpolicy/121504.html 2. HHS Office of Security and Drug Testing, Personnel Security/Suitability Handbook, dated February 1, 2005. http://www.knownet.hhs.gov/acquisition/pssh.pdf 3. HHS HSPD-12 Policy Document, v. 2.0. http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05 -24.pdf

c. d.

This contract/order will entail the following position sensitivity level(s): Level 5: Public Trust - Moderate Risk. The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that the Contractor prepare and submit background check/investigation forms based on the type of investigation required. The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) with fingerprinting. More restricted positions--i.e., those above non-sensitive, require more extensive documentation and investigation. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in advance when any new personnel, who are subject to a background check/investigation, will work under the contract and if they have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background investigations. Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays--see FAR 52.249-14. Accordingly, the Contractor shall ensure that any additional employees whose names it submits for work under this contract have a reasonable chance for approval. Typically, the Government investigates personnel at no cost to the Contractor. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the additional investigation(s). The Contractor shall include language similar to this ``HHS-Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security'' language in all subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have the same frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHScontrolled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS-controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3). The Contractor shall direct inquiries, including requests for forms and assistance, to the Contracting Officer or designee.

FAR 52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)

The Government contemplates award of a labor-hour contract resulting from this solicitation. Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary (FAR 52.212-1(g)). 10.3 HHSAR 352.239-73(a) ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (JANUARY 2010)

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any federal department or agency permit. 1. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and 2. Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must

13-233-SOL-00156 Department of Health and Human Services Innovation Website

Page 23 of 28

demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm. The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Performance Work Statement/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website (http://www.hhs.gov/od/). Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense. 10.4 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS/BASIC FORMAT Information requested herein must be furnished in writing fully and completely in compliance with instructions. The information requested and the manner of submittal is essential to permit prompt evaluation of all quotes on a fair and uniform basis. Simple statements of compliance (i.e., "understood"; "will comply") without the detailed description of how compliance will be met may not be considered sufficient evidence that the proposed services can technically meet the requirements of this SOLICITATION. Accordingly, any quote in which material information requested is not furnished, or where indirect or incomplete answers or information are provided may be considered not acceptable. All Offerors shall submit a quote consisting of a separate technical and price volume. The volumes shall be as follows: Volume I: Technical Proposal, Volume II: Business Proposal. Each volume shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of evaluation of the other. The SOLICITATION does not commit the Government to pay any cost for preparation and submission of a quote. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this proposed acquisition.

HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template
Purpose: This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human Services

Background: In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508. The result of their collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template ­ a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not meet the various Section 508 Requirements.

How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized: This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables. The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Section 508 Standards. Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a Section 508 Standard is composed of. It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not comply with a specific requirement. Understanding the columns Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template's tables: Summary Table Column Name Criteria: Supporting Features: Use Describes Subparts B, C, and D of the Section 508 Standards. Enter information summarizing a product's overall "level-of support" for the corresponding Subpart or, when appropriate, to specify Not Applicable. DO NOT ENTER REMARKS OR EXPLANATIONS IN THIS COLUMN. Enter general comments regarding a product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Applicable Subpart. Section 1194.xx Tables Use Describes a specific guideline that a Subpart is composed of. Enter information summarizing a product's "level-of-support" for a specific guideline.

RFP No. 12-233-SOL-00156

Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template: To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company's technical specialist for the product being sought for purchase. HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses. Once you have enlisted their assistance: 1) Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C ­ 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D ­ 1194.41) sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template. 2) For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements. 3) Using the information found in the How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.
ˇ ˇ If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support the standard. If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability. If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly how the product did not meet the standard.

ˇ

4) Once documented in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how the product did or did not meet, return to the Summary Table and document the product's overall "level-of-conformance" in each of the applicable sections. 5) Post the final Section 508 Evaluation Template on your company's web site or on the GSA Buy Accessible Wizard. 6) It is the Vendor's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data on the Section 508 Evaluation Template. The information provided on the Section 508 Evaluation Template is considered a self-representation unless expressly affirmed otherwise. Even so, HHS uses this form to complete required Market Research associated with the agency complying with Section 508 and may use the form to eliminate this product compared to other more accessible products that meet the HHS business needs.

* Please Note: Any WEB application being purchased by HHS also requires the Vendor to complete Section 1194.21 of the Section 508 Evaluation Template in addition to Sections 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41.
ˇ ˇ ˇ HHS reserves the right to reject a PAT and corresponding proposal/offering if the answers do not address the standards. HHS needs the PAT to address the standards in order to evaluate it for conformance. Please answer honestly and be prepared to work with HHS to improve accessibility for your product if it is purchased. Submission of this documentation constitutes a warrant on behalf of the vendor of the conformance of their product. Remediation of a product or service to the specified conformance shall be the responsibility of the vendor.
