a. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS INTRODUCTION The following instructions will establish the format and contents of proposals. Special attention is directed to the Fixed Price for technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these instructions. 1 Contract Type and General Clauses It is contemplated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded. Any resultant contract shall include the clauses applicable to the selected offerors organization and type of contract awarded as required by Public Law, Executive Order, or acquisition regulations in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract. 2 Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization and must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFP. Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the addressees, and marked as indicated in the Attachment entitled, PACKAGING AND DELIVERY OF PROPOSAL. Proposals will be typewritten, paginated, reproduced on letter size paper and will be legible in all required copies. To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order: I. COVER PAGE Include RFP title, number, name of organization, identification of the proposal part, and indicate whether the proposal is an original or a copy. II. TECHNICAL PROPOSAL It is recommended that the technical proposal consist of a cover page, a table of contents, and the information requested in the Technical Proposal Instructions. III. BUSINESS PROPOSAL It is recommended that the business proposal consist of a cover page, a table of contents, and the information requested in the Business Proposal Instructions.

Separation of Technical and Business Proposals The proposal must be prepared in two parts: a "Technical Proposal", and a "Business Proposal" (maybe contained in one binder with two separate sections). Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other. The technical proposal may include direct cost and resources information, such as labor-hours and categories and applicable rates, materials, subcontracts, travel, etc., and associated costs so that the offerors understanding of the project may be evaluated, but should not include pricing data relating to individual salary information, indirect cost rates or amounts, fee amounts (if any)., and total costs. The technical proposal should disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the Fixed Price of the technical proposal instructions.

Use of the Metric System of Measurement It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to support the Federal transition to the metric system and to use the metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business related activities unless such use is impracticable or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies. The offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement. The following definitions are provided for your information: Hard Metric - The replacement of a standard inch/pound size with an accepted metric size when necessitated for a particular purpose. An example of size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart (as for soft drinks), or instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline). Soft Metric - The result of a mathematical conversion of inch/pound measurements to metric equivalents when necessitated for a particular purpose. The physical characteristics are not changed. Dual Systems - The use of both inch-pound and metric systems. For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes.

The committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation criteria of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written critiques. The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror. The business portion of each contract proposal will be evaluated for cost reasonableness. If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of an Offerors past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors. If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract1.

Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range. 3 01-25-2011

This process will take into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, the past performance evaluation (if applicable) and the cost analysis. The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP. In addition, the RFP may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet the Government=s Fixed Price.

Violation of the Act may involve the imposition of criminal penalties. FAR 52.224-2 Privacy Act (April 1984) (a) The Contractor agrees to-- (1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies-- (i) The systems of records; and (ii) The design, development, or operation work that the contractor is to perform; (2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals that is subject to the Act; and (3) Include this clause, including this paragraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a system of records. (b) In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the Contractor is considered to be an employee of the agency. (c)(1) "Operation of a system of records," as used in this clause, means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the system of records, including the collection, use, and dissemination of records. (2) "Record," as used in this clause, means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial

Attachment No 1 ­ Statement of Work TPN/Dialysis Compounder The Clinical Center Pharmacy Intravenous Additive Unit (IAU) prepares intravenous medications to support research protocols. One of the tools the IAU uses is an automated TPN/Dialysis compounder. Specifically, those patients that are on a protocol and receive TPN (total parental nutrition) and/or CVVH dialysis treatment, the compounder allows the pharmacy department staff to safely and efficiently prepare these products for patients. Safety is of paramount importance to the NIH mission. The department is currently leasing the MicroMacro 12 Lead Compounder (MMI2) from Baxa Corporation to prepare the 12 to 15 TPN bags we prepare daily as well as any CVVH bags. The pharmacy department has a requirement to evaluate and lease another compounder to serve our TPN and dialysis patients. The specifications that we require for a TPN/dialysis compounder include, but are not limited to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ 24 Lead Compounder (Plus a Back up) capable of pumping 24 ingredients, including syringes 0.2 ml minimum pumping volume self-calibrating pump ability to detect Air and occlusion in tube sets electronic Y sites to minimize source container changeovers warning indicator for incompatible mixing sdquences ability to compound Cardio and CVVH solutions as well as TPNs integrated weigh scale shall be a closed system mix-check report to audit record for QA and accuracy tracks lot # and expiration date calibration report meets USP-797 recommendations Laser barcode reader (Plus a Back up) to verify source containers and TPN label Color monitor (Plus a Back up) Electronic scale (Plus a Back up) Laser Printer for reports Zebra or equivalent Printer for labels Window's Based Operating software Order entry and calculating software Computer with color monitor to operate above software
