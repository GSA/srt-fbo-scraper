SCOPE OF WORK

SCOPE OF WORK "OUR MISSISSIPPI"- MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN PUBLIC OUTREACH/CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS CONTRACT 1. General Scope A. General Information: Under this Scope of Work (SOW), the contractor will provide writing and editorial services for production of printed newsletter on the entire Mississippi River system, including the programs on the Upper and Lower River portions. This contract shall consist of all aspects in production (writing, editing, designing and artwork) and mailing 3 editions of the Corps of Engineers "OUR MISSISSIPPI" newsletter, inclusive of printing and distribution

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 5 of 115

B. Location of Work: The primary work is located within the entire Mississippi River system. Initial focus areas are in the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. Work will also come from the lower Mississippi River region to the Gulf of Mexico. The primary work will be design work from remote areas and daily travel will not be needed to attend work group stakeholder meetings. All work group stakeholder meetings are to be phone in teleconference. Quarterly newsletter initiation and brainstorming meetings will require travel to participate in, and facilitate discussions. C. Study Description: Over the past 20 years, efforts of the Upper Mississippi River District offices have resulted in the generation of enhanced public and stakeholder interest and participation in Corps initiatives. In 1991 quarterly mailings were to roughly 1,000 persons and has grown to over 20,000 persons with bulk distribution to 30,000 additional persons. The publications started as basic informational newsletters and have evolved into a very interesting, tabloid style, full color publication with information and facts from various angles from all around the Mississippi Valley region. Annual growth rate has been over 5% in the past few years and is expected to continue for the period of this contract. 2. Services Required All work shall be in accordance with requirements as specified in this Scope of Work. A. The required work in this contract is to produce a professional newsletter that is consistent with the current "Our Mississippi" brand and promote/enhance that program. The contractor will initiate, create, coordinate, conduct field investigations, write, design, layout, proof, arrange for comments, incorporate changes, finalize and print/distribute the OUR MISSISSIPPI newsletter to 20,000 addresses in the Mississippi Valley Division (MVD) mailing list and 30,000 pieces to another 350 locations in the Mississippi Valley region. There are an additional 10 distribution locations outside the region and 4 international shipments. The newsletter is to be produced and distributed quarterly (Spring, Summer and Fall 2014 only) starting with the first quarter after award of this contract. The distribution dates will be 30 March 15 June and 15 September 2014 to ensure time for shipping and mailing of the newsletter to their final locations. The Our Mississippi newsletter is a 12 page document (approximate word count is 11,000) to be created using environmentally friendly inks and paper. The artwork and photos (all created/taken/paid for by the contractor) are to be high resolution, color items, and inserted electronically into the publication and follow the industry standards for printing and on-line publications. B. During the execution of the work, the Contractor will consult with the Public Outreach Team (PORT) team members to ensure the newsletter is consistent with the current message and theme (explained in paragraph C below) and to obtain required information pertinent to writing stories and articles for the newsletters. This may include travel to other Corps District offices within the location of work. The Rock Island District in Rock Island, IL is the most likely travel location but may include travel to a number of

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 6 of 115

other Corps Districts. The newsletter will be comprised of several stories and articles, with creative and high quality graphics/photos, to be written and developed by the contractor based on the current message and theme of the OUR MISSISSIPPI newsletter, as described in paragraph C below. The template for the newsletter is to follow the past editions of OUR MISSISSIPPI newsletter and include similar design elements and cues to keep continuity for the reader. The consistent message, look, and feel are extremely important in the branding work that has been in place since 2008. The articles of the newsletter should be reflective of the Corps and Stakeholder needs and encompass a wide variety of activities relevant to the entire Mississippi River, including the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program (NESP), the Environment Management Plan (EMP), Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) Regulatory, Operations and Emergency actions of the Corps of Engineers, plus activities of partner and stakeholder organizations along the River from Minnesota thru Louisiana. C. Contractor is responsible for the initial development of an idea list and the research and writing of magazine quality text that is accessible and interesting to the general public, but also sophisticated enough for lawmakers and long-time river interests represented to have their needs met. Some story source names will be provided by the Corps, but most of the idea and article development relies on the contractor initiative, and a variety of sources representing collaboration will be expected for a given piece. Contractor is responsible for shooting and/or purchasing photography/art work and for securing highresolution photography (if available) from the Corps or other relevant organizations/agencies. Stories should strive for a timely hook, when appropriate, but also be written in a way timeless enough to keep them relevant through the three-month period during which each issue is in circulation. The story mix must support a watershedwide approach to river sustainability now championed by the Corps and its partners but also a format established with earlier issues that includes segments such as: "My Mississippi" personality profiles, and educational but fun and graphically interesting Kids Page and multiple stories that connect to various Corps missions. All story development and review will be agreed upon by the PORT team prior to start of work and final story development by the contractor. All development is to be consistent with the current Our Mississippi outreach program and the Corps of Engineers design standards. Each newsletter is subject to reviews conducted by the COR and study team members. These reviews will further refine the draft articles and help shape the final newsletter. The Contractor will be present for all draft review teleconferences and will be responsible for making all required changes to the newsletter to create the next version. The review process is iterative and usually will require a minimum of three draft reviews and a maximum of five reviews. Changes and comments will be received in various forms from fax, email, and verbal. The Contractor is responsible for making all changes and rewriting the articles based on study team comments. The Contractor will respond in writing to all written comments received. The Contractor is responsible for proper grammar usage and assuring there are no spelling errors in draft versions of the newsletters.

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 7 of 115

D. The final draft of the newsletter will be approved by the COR in consultation with other internal Corps study members. Once the newsletter is approved for printing, a high resolution PDF of the final document will be emailed to the COR for final approval. The COR will have one day to review, make changes, and approve proof copy. If mistakes are found in the proof that are significant errors/omissions, corrections will be required and a new proof copy delivered to the COR for final approval. Proof copies can be overnight delivered using any overnight service. The Contractor is responsible for the subsequent printing and distribution of 50,000 copies of the newsletter. The newsletter is to be printed on white, 80 lb., 14"x21" recycled paper, using soy ink in full 6 color processing. Printing is a full bleed document. Printer plates are to be created at a minimum of 133 line screen resolution for maximum clarity. For mailing, the newsletter is to be folded in half, folded in half again, and tabbed on the center of the open end (same as shown on past newsletters). E. The distribution is to be done using the U.S. Post Office, third class bulk rate mail (the piece does not qualify for bulk rate discounts). Two databases in Microsoft Excel will be provided by the COR prior to each mailing for the most current addresses. The list is currently at 50,000 addresses and is anticipated to grow 5% each quarter. The contractor is to plan to accommodate this growth rate for each quarterly distribution. The preferred mailing method utilizes ink jetting the addresses on the newsletters and presorting the newsletters before they are mailed to save the Government money. The newsletters must be post marked by the dates indicated in paragraph 4.A of this scope of work. The Contractor will also distribute bulk mailings to the other District and Division offices involved in the study. All extra copies of the newsletter are to be mailed to the COR. F. The final step in distribution of the newsletter is an electronic PDF version of the newsletter for use on the Corps Internet Web Page. This needs to be delivered to the COR within 2 days after each final newsletter is submitted. Both a Hi-Rez and Low-Rez PDFs are required to be submitted. 3. Contract Pricing A. The Contractor's pricing shall include the cost of all data collection, writing, and editing of newsletter articles, travel, teleconferences, and associated costs to accomplish the work under the contract, except as may be otherwise specifically provided for in this contract.

4. Schedules and Submission A. All work under this contract shall be completed and submitted in a timely manner to meet target distribution dates throughout the contract period. Distribution dates for the newsletters are no later than 30 March, 15 June, and 15 Sept. Work will begin 25 February, or as soon as the contract is in place. Work will conclude on 30 September, so the contractor is expected to be ready and able to work efficiently and effectively to keep the tight schedule and avoid delays to the schedule.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 40 of 115 Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an AntiDeficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it ( ) is, ( ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code contract number .

52.222-41

SERVICE CONTRACT ACT OF 1965 (NOV 2007)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-"Act," means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee," means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this con- tract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 53 of 115 wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent informa-tion to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determina- tions issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of Compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or fur- nished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 54 of 115 to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum Wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor Contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to Employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 55 of 115 representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act-(A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay Periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service Employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 56 of 115 contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority List. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and Interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's Certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions Involving Employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR Parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices.

(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.

(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 65 of 115 (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-(i) Making a correct payment; (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database. (End of Clause)

(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.

In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.

99842 - Vending Machine Repairer Helper 16.08 ____________________________________________________________________________________ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 25 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174) THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) APPLICABLE TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ONLY - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL: An employee is entitled to pay for all work performed between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M. at the rate of basic pay plus a night pay differential amounting to 10 percent of the rate of basic pay.

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 90 of 115

3) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are

available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

Length of service  includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or  successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the  performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)    HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther  King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor  Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A  contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in  accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)    THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:    1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does  not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,  administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because  most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate  not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per  week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.  400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations  within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not  list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey  data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds  $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For 

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 101 of 115

example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties  within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer  occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,  then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the  conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage  determination.    Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer  industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer  professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees  who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:      (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including  consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional  specifications;      (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or  modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and  related to user or system design specifications;      (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer  programs related to machine operating systems; or      (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which  requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).    2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS  NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you  work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential  and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.   If you are a fulltime employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your  regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday  premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime  (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered  overtime work).    HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees  employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or  in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This  includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive  ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder  and photoflash powder.  All dryhouse activities involving propellants or explosives.    Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations  on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations  involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.    A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that  represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to  ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials  which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the  employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the  like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.

All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and  incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials  are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for  ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.    ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **    If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract  (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or  local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by  laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an  employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage  determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the  following standards as compliance:    The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an  adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual  cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made  the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to  this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining  agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary  affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning  and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in  those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"  materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do  not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial  laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms  of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,  there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.    The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the  "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,  unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A  links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.  gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations OnLine (WDOL) Web site at  http://wdol.gov/.    REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form  1444 (SF 1444)}    Conformance Process:    The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is  not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to  be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage  determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable  relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted 

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 103 of 115

classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such  conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the  fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by  the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)  of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall  be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}  When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444  should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be  conformed.    The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:    1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed  occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).    2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order  proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each  proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage  rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the  authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized  representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the  contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees  performs any contract work.    3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report  of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent  information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage  and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,  for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).    4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or  disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or  notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process  the request.    5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.    6) The contractor informs the affected employees.    Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.    When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of  Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure  that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the  wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that  determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.  Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide

classifications listed in the wage determination.

Length of service includes the whole span of  continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the  predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR  4.173)  HOLIDAYS: A minimum of twelve paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's  Birthday,  Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus  Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, the Day before Christmas, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may  substitute for any of the named holidays another day of with pay in accordance with a plan  communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4.174)    THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:    1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to  any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional  employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer  Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate  not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R.  541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job  families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all  occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the  occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt  employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties  within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for  which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee  must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note  included on this wage determination.    Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are  not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption 

W912ES-14-T-0029 Page 113 of 115

applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary  duty consists of:  (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including  consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;   (2) The  design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or  programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;  (3) The  design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine  operating systems; or  (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which  requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).  2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS  NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at  night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of  basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.  If you are a fulltime employed (40 hours a  week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay  plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime  (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).    HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a  position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance,  explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and  pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black   powder and photoflash powder.  All dryhouse activities involving propellants or explosives.   Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive  ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regrading and cleaning of  artillery ranges.    A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree  of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to)  explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or  arms of the employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal  damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving,  unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than  small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically  designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.    ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **    If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of  the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such  uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be  borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage  determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following  standards as compliance:  The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of  uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where  uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and  subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective  bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as  to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per

week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of  "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do  not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order  to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the  contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed  for uniform maintenance costs.    The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory  of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are  available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at  http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations OnLine (WDOL) Web site at  http://wdol.gov/.    REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form  1444 (SF 1444)}    Conformance Process:    The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and  which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any  classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a  reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications  and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be  paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process  shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)  of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the  commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are  included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a  class(es) is to beconformed.    The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:    1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and  computes a proposed rate(s).  2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification  title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and  rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of  the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized  representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer  no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.  3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action,  together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the  contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration,  U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).  4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action  via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time  will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.  6) The contractor informs the affected employees.    Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.    When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the  Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed  by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the  required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.  Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the  wage determination.
