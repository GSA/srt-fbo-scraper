Background and Need

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is seeking to partner with healthcare delivery systems to evaluate the impact of interventions
designed to prevent healthcare associated infections. The goal is to create a clinical research network in which actionable new knowledge about
prevention of HAIs can be created. The purpose of this sample task order is to provide an opportunity for Offerors to demonstrate the capacity
to implement multicenter HAI prevention research.

Objectives

In recent year, there has been increased national attention to the role of contamination of the patient care environment in the transmission of
epidemiologically important pathogens such as C. difficile. For the purposes of this task order, Offerors should assume they would be provided
with a detailed study protocol designed to test the impact of a novel environmental cleaning agent that is highly effective at killing
microorganisms on environmental surfaces. In developing the research implementation plan, the Offeror should assume that the novel environmental
cleaning agent is identical in cost to agents currently used in study hospitals, and is applied using methods identical to those currently used
in study hospitals.

The overall objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that routine use of the novel cleaning agent for routine environmental cleaning
in hospitals will reduce HAI rates in comparison to standard cleaning agents.

The two specific tasks are as follows:

   1. In a multicenter cluster randomized trial, compare the effectiveness of use of the novel cleaning agent for routine environmental cleaning
      for prevention of HAI in hospitals.


   2. Develop a searchable database from source data.


Scope of Work

The contractor shall provide all labor, expertise, materials, supplies and perform all services required to carry out the work under this
contract. The Offeror should describe their capacity and approach to implementing the study protocol, which will be a cluster randomized,
multicenter  trial designed to test the effectiveness of routine use of the novel cleaning agent as a strategy for preventing HAIs.

Tasks
The Contractor shall furnish all supplies, equipment, facilities and services required to perform work under this contract.


Task 1: Start Up Meeting
    • The Contractor shall arrange and conduct an initial meeting (either in person or by teleconference) with the CDC Project Officer and  other
      relevant staff within 2 weeks of the effective date of the task order. The purpose of the meeting will be to review and clarify  the  scope
      of work and delivery schedule for tasks, to delineate roles and responsibilities, and to establish communication protocols. Each  task  and
      deliverable will be reviewed.


    • The Contractor shall submit an agenda for the above meeting within 1 week of the effective date of the task order.

Task 2: Maintain Communication with the Project Officer
    • The Contractor shall coordinate with the CDC Project Officer. The Contractor shall maintain regular communications with the Project Officer
      and CDC staff involved with the project. The chief means of communication will be via conference calls that will be scheduled  every  month
      throughout the project period required to complete the project. Additional calls will be scheduled as needed. The Contractor shall  provide
      an agenda and meeting minutes for each call. All conference calls shall be scheduled and administered by  the  Contractor.  The  Contractor
      shall respond to all emails and telephone communications from the Project Officer within 2-3 working days.

Task 3: Quarterly Progress Reports
    • On the 10th day following the 3 months being reported, the contractor shall prepare and submit a quarterly progress report  containing  the
      current status of work and a financial status report.  The report shall contain, at  a  minimum,  the  current  progress  on  each  of  the
      requirements set forth below, the financial status of the project, problems encountered during the month,  solutions  implemented,  planned
      activity for the upcoming month and any other information mutually agreed upon between the contractor and the CDC Project Officer.

Task 4: Develop Overall Research Plan
    • Research Design:  The study will follow a protocol provided by CDC to be available at time of award. The study design will be a cluster
      randomized trial that assesses the comparative effectiveness of routine environmental cleaning with the novel cleaning agent and a
      comparator cleaning agent. Participating hospitals will be randomized to one of two arms in which routine environmental cleaning will be
      performed using either the novel cleaning agent or the comparator agent.  The intervention period will last for 6 months. The Offeror
      should assume that the novel and comparator cleaning agents are  identical in cost to agents currently used in study hospitals, and are
      applied using methods identicial to those currently used in study hospitals. The offeror should assume that compliance with use of the
      study and comparator agents will be monitored through volume of product used and direct observation on a sample of daily patient room
      cleanings. The primary outcome will be the hospital-wide incidence of HAI as defined using CDC surveillance definitions (see section C).
      Secondary outcomes will include the hospital-onset incidence of all-cause bacteremia, and the incidence of certain multi-drug-resistant
      organisms (see section C).



Task 5: Facility Recruitment
    • At least 10 hospitals shall be recruited to participate.
    • The Contractor should include plans for a formal mechanism to conduct the proposed intervention.

Task 6: Preparation of IRB packages

    • If required, the Contractor shall prepare all forms and materials to submit the data collection tool for IRB Clearance. All evaluation
      instruments must be approved by CDC staff prior to submission for IRB clearance and/or administration to prospective respondents. In
      conjunction with CDC, the Contractor will respond to all questions from OMB and will prepare the final package for clearance by OMB.


Task 7: Data Collection and Analysis
Database:  The vendor shall create a database of all source data from the project that is searchable. The database will include elements related
to intervention assignment and implementation, hospital location, compliance with intervention, data sufficient for calculating incidence rates
for HAI (central line-associated bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter associated urinary tract infections). As a
secondary outcomes, the incidence of bacteremia (as defined by a positive blood culture), as well as incidence of MRSA, C. difficile, and
multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. using the method defined by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology’s white paper entitled
“Recommendations for Metrics for Multidrug‐Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings: SHEA/HICPAC Position Paper” (Cohen et al, Infection
Control and Hospital Epidemiology.2008;29:901-913) In addition, Administrative data sufficient for case mix adjustment, and data related to
emergence of relevant antimicrobial resistance patterns
    • .
   Analysis:  The vendor shall make the database available to CDC investigators for analysis. It is expected that the results of the study will
   be prepared for publication in peer-review scientific literature. The vendor may participate in manuscript preparation and authorship as
   appropriate if desired.


Task 8: Final Report
    • There will be total of 3 reports submitted for CDC approval, preliminary, final draft, and final. The  Contractor  shall  present  a  final
      report of the project to the CDC Project Officer within 4 weeks after receiving comments and  recommendations  on  the  draft  report.  The
      Contractor shall submit the final report, incorporating CDC’s  comments  and  recommendations.  The  report  shall  include  with  it,  all
      documentation including raw and computed data and programming collected with this task order. The submission shall be  in  both  paper  and
      electronic format.


    • The Contractor will electronically submit the final report to the PO.  The finalized report is to  be  “camera  ready”,  meaning  that  the
      report should be accurate, complete, and suitable for preparation of negatives.


    • Camera-ready copy is printed on one side of the page only; pages are numbered  according  to  CDC’s  convention  (e.g.,  lower  case  roman
      numerals for front matter; Arabic numbers for body of the report); pages have a 1-inch margin all around; margin  for  side  that  will  be
      bound must be 1 inch to avoid losing text.  Endnote or other reference manager software should be  used  to  compile  reference  lists  and
      bibliography.  Citations should be “grabbed” electronically by the software from PubMed or another source to render  them  as  accurate  as
      possible.  In addition to hard copy, the report is to be submitted on disks (WordPerfect or Microsoft Word) for  use  in  Web  preparation.
      Appendices should be submitted only electronically on a CD.  Electronic files for charts, etc., prepared in another program  (e.g.,  Excel)
      must be submitted.  Tables and charts must be delinked from underlying databases.

                                                          TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

Award: This Task Order will be awarded to the Offeror whose proposal is considered to be the most advantageous to the Government, price and
other factors (identified below) considered. For purposes of this evaluation; technical factors, (methodology/approach, staffing/management and
experience) are more important in making the award determination.  The Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost
to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance.

Technical Evaluation: Technical proposals will be evaluated according to the criteria set forth below:

            Points or relative Criteria               Value of Criteria
            Methodology and Approach                                 40
            Similar Experience                                25
            Staffing and Management                           35


            TOTAL SCORE                                100



1) Methodology and Approach (40 points)


   a. The Offeror shall provide a brief review of the issues(s)/problem(s) associated with performing this type of research which underscore the
      concept of and need for this RFTO. 


   b. The plan should describe in detail the current relationship the vendor has to potential study hospitals, including detailed description of
      the hospitals (bed size, populations, geographic location, for-profit status, academic affiliation, etc.), a detailed plan for hospital
      recruitment, a detailed description of current infrastructure among potentially participating hospitals that will facilitate both
      implementation of the intervention as well as collection of process and outcome data necessary for analysis.


   c. The plan should include a detailed plan for outcome data collection, including current HAI surveillance methods in place in potentially
      participating hospitals, laboratory and other clinical information systems currently in use in potential participating hospitals that will
      facilitate collection of process and outcome data.


   d. The proposal shall be evaluated on the Offeror’s demonstrated capability for recruiting hospitals into the project. Offerors who already
      have recruited hospitals and submit signed letters of commitment with their proposal shall receive full points.


   e. The technical approach shall be evaluated on the completeness, reasonableness, clarity, and feasibility of the approach to satisfy the
      requirements of the Task Order.



2) Similar Experience  (25 points)
   a. The proposal shall be evaluated on the Offeror‘s demonstrated experience in conducting and managing projects relevant to the content and
      complexity of this Task Order.

5).    Staffing and Management:  (35 points)
   a. Contractors are to provide (1) a staffing plan that demonstrates and understanding of the labor requirements for this task order; and (2) a
      management plan that describes the approach for managing the work, to include subcontract management if applicable.   Curriculum vitae
      should be provided, detailing relevant training and experience for each key person. Ideal staffing to successfully accomplish the tasks of
      this acquisition:

     1. Principal investigator with sufficient time devoted to overseeing the implementation of the project.  This person should have experience
        executing evaluation research projects related to Public Health or Infectious Disease. Demonstrated experience specifically with
        Healthcare-associated infections or infection control and prevention settings will be considered a plus.
     2. Project co-coordinator with experience in developing and executing research projects.
     3. Epidemiologist/Statistician/Research Associate with experience in quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis.


        This criterion will be evaluated according to the soundness, practicality, and feasibility of the offeror’s staffing and management
        plans for this task order.


6).     Cost Evaluation: (Not scored)

   b. A cost analysis of the business cost proposal shall be conducted to determine the reasonableness of the proposal.

Section C - Description/Specification/Work Statement


Title:  Safety and Healthcare Epidemiology Prevention Research Development (SHEPheRD) Program


C.1 Background and Need
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and other adverse events continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality among patients treated  in
healthcare institutions and add billions of dollars to healthcare costs in the United States.  Additional Healthcare Epidemiology  and  Infection
Control research is needed to facilitate development of innovative strategies for detection and  prevention  of  HAIs,  Antimicrobial  Resistance
(AR), and other adverse events in order to reduce the morbidity,  mortality,  and  costs  associated  with  these  conditions.  The  Division  of
Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has  recently  re-organized  its  HAI  prevention
research program to include multiple complementary initiatives. Currently titled the SHEPheRD Program, it is designed to maximize  CDC’s  ability
to perform translational HAI prevention research. This indefinite delivery,  indefinite  quantity  (IDIQ)  contract  is  one  component  of  this
multifaceted research program. The SHEPheRD Program will eventually consist of four functional domains: 1) Research Implementation,  2)  Research
Development, 3) Program Assessment/Evaluation Studies and 4) Program Support Services. This contract will address only domain 1.

C.2 Project Identification and Purpose

The purpose of this indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is to provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) an “as needed” mechanism to obtain required services through issuance of individual task orders
in support of HAI prevention research studies that meet public health priorities for CDC. The scope of this contract is to provide scientific,
technical, and management expertise, and related services involving research, planning, assessment, development, management, support, and

H.1  FAR CDC0.H019 Security Clearances (Sep 2009)

CDC0_H019  Security Clearances

(a) Definitions.

“Employees” means both contractor and subcontractor employees unless otherwise noted:

The phrase “CDC owned or leased facilities” includes ATSDR, NIOSH/PRC/Pittsburgh, Pa.; NIOSH/Morgantown, W.V.; NIOSH/SRC/Spokane, WA;
NIOSH/Cincinnati, OH; NCHS/Research Triangle Park, NC; NCHS/Hyattsville, MD, NCID/Fort Collins, CO; NCID/Anchorage, AK, and NCID/San Juan, PR.

(b)  General

All contract employees who will be performing work under this contract on-site (i.e., in a CDC owned or leased facility) for a period exceeding
90 days in duration (45 days if employee is designated to work in Building 10, 15, or 17 at 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, or at CDC’s
Lawrenceville, GA facility) shall receive a favorable suitability determination prior to reporting to work at an on-site facility.  Any contract
employee(s) who cannot obtain a favorable suitability determination will not be permitted to work at an on-site facility (see paragraph B below
on temporary determinations.)

The Contractor shall be responsible for managing its workforce to ensure that sufficient contract employees who meet all suitability
requirements are available to perform the duties required under the contract.  New or replacement contract employees must have previously
received a favorable suitability determination in sufficient time to perform work at an on-site facility under the contract.  If it has been
over one (1) year since a contract employee has worked in a position on a Federal contract for which a security clearance was required, a new
National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) must be obtained.

(c)  Temporary Determinations/Clearances

The Contracting Officer may, as appropriate, authorize and grant temporary suitability determinations to contract employees.  However, the
granting of a temporary determination shall not be considered as assurance that full clearance will follow.  The granting of a temporary
determination shall not prevent, preclude or bar the withdrawal or termination of any temporary determination.  Prior to the Government's
issuance of a temporary determination, the Contractor shall obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide criminal records check
for all on-site contract employees.  The Contractor shall also obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide motor vehicle
violations check for any contract employee required to operate a motor vehicle as part of their duties under the contract at an on-site
facility.  All criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks shall cover a twelve (12) month period beginning twelve (12) months
prior to the date of the contract award. Criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks may be obtained through local state, county
or city law enforcement agencies at contract employees’ place of residence.  Where state-wide criminal record and motor vehicle violation
systems are not available, county-wide or city-wide checks may be substituted.  All substitutions shall be certified by the law enforcement
agency that a state-wide criminal record system is not available.

(d) Required Information for NACI Clearance:

Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall submit the completed forms specified below to the appropriate office as directed by the
Contracting Officer not later then 5 calendar days from the effective date of the contract. Items (1) through (6) must be completed by contract
employees who require access to on-site facilities in the performance of the contract.  Additionally, the contractor shall furnish, on a monthly
basis, item (7) (if the information requested in Item (7) is provided as part of the Contractor’s standard invoice, no additional submission is
required).  The Government will furnish the necessary forms to the Contractor.

(1) Two (2) completed Forms FD-258, "FBI Fingerprint Charts"***

(2) One (1) completed Standard Form 85, "Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions"

(3) One (1) completed "Declaration for Enrollment"

(4) One (1) resume or curriculum vitae or completed job application form

(5) One (1) copy of the state-wide criminal records check

(6) One (1) copy of the motor vehicle violations check (when applicable)

(7) A complete listing of all current Contractor and Subcontractor on-site employees by name, work location and employer.

*** The CDC, Human Resource Management Offices (HRMO) have the necessary equipment to complete fingerprint charts (FD-258).  The Contractor may
contact the Contracting Officer for arrangements regarding utilization of the HRMO fingerprinting equipment.  The fingerprint charts may also be
completed through a local state, county or city law enforcement agency at the employee's place of residence.

Using the required information specified above, a National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) will be processed by the CDC through the Office of
Personnel Management and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (OPM/FBI) on each contract employee who will be performing duties on-site.

(d)  Removal of Contractor Employees

The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility who has failed to
receive a suitability determination and whose continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest, inconsistent with the best
interests of security, or is identified as a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or operational mission of the
on-site facility and its population.   The Contracting Officer may also request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from
the on-site facility should it be determined that the individuals are being assigned to duty who have been disqualified for suitability reasons,
or who are found to be unfit for performing duties during their tour(s) of duty.  Contract employees who are requested to be removed from the on-
site facility are required to leave the work site immediately.

The Contracting Officer will make all determinations regarding the removal of any contract employee from the on-site facility, except under
certain conditions.  When a Contracting Officer is not available, either during the day or after normal business hours, or in situations where a
delay would not be in the best interest of the Government, or a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or
operational mission of the facility and its population, the Project Officer will have the authority to direct immediate removal of the
contractor employee from the on-site facility. The Contracting Officer shall subsequently provide the official notification to the Contractor
for removal of a contract employee from the CDC facility.  When removal is directed due to a non-suitability determination as a result of the
NACI, no further information will be provided.  If removal is directed for other reasons relating to specific conduct of the employee during
performance of the work, the Contracting Officer’s official notification will provide information as to these reasons.

(e)  Identification Badges/Cardkey Access:

(1)  Identification Badges:

The Contractor shall require each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility, either through the
temporary clearance process or the formal NACI process, to display an identification badge as required and furnished by the CDC.  The Contractor
shall submit to the Project Officer a completed Identification Badge Request Form (CDC Form 0.1137) for each contract employee who has been
authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility.  Contact the Project Officer for details on additional procedures, specific addresses and
hours of business for issuance of Identification Badges for all other CDC locations.

(2)  Cardkey Access:

Unescorted access to certain on-site facilities at CDC may only be gained through the use of a Cardkey.  If a contract employee has been
determined to need regular unescorted access to one of the Cardkey access designated areas, a Cardkey Request Form (CDC Form 0.834) must be
completed and submitted to the Project Officer for written approval.  Contact the Project Officer for details of procedures and specific
addresses and hours of business for issuance of Cardkey Access.

(3)  Return of Identification Badges/Cardkeys

The Contractor shall arrange for the return of any employee identification badges and/or cardkeys immediately upon their separation of the
duties at the on-site facility.  Contact the Project Officer for location of the depositories for the return of badges.  Cardkeys shall be
returned to the appropriate Physical Security Activity Office.

H.8  Agency Ombudsman (Sep 2009)

CDC0_H046  Agency Ombudsman

CDC is committed to ensuring fair opportunity for all offerors submitting proposals for competitive task/delivery orders issued against existing
contracts in accordance with FAR 16.505. Offerors/Contractors may protest task/delivery order awards of any amount on the grounds that the order
increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order was issued.  These complaints may be lodged at the agency
level or protested with the General Accountability Office (GAO).

Additionally, in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(j), protests of task/delivery orders valued in excess of $10,000,000.00 should be filed directly
with the GAO in accordance with FAR 33.104.

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(5), CDC has designated an agency Task/Delivery Order Ombudsman who is responsible for reviewing the complaints
from contractors on the task/delivery order process. The Ombudsman's responsibility is to review complaints and ensure that all contractors are
afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with procedures in the contract. The Contract Ombudsman is independent of the
contracting office.  The process for handling complaints under the Ombudsman is as follows:

   a) The written complaint must include all the information required for agency protests in FAR 33.103 and must be sent to:


        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
        Attn: Jim Seligman, Agency Ombudsman
        1600 Clifton Rd, NE
        Bldg 21, 12th Floor
        Atlanta, GA 30329

        Telephone:  404-639-7601
        Facsimile:  404-639-7113
        Email: jds1@cdc.gov

      Complaints must be submitted to the Agency Ombudsman no later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been
      known, whichever is earlier.

   b) The Ombudsman will contact the complainant by phone, to assure full understanding of the issues raised in the protest. This contact will be
      made within 2 business days of the receipt of the protests by the Ombudsman. Since there is only one individual serving as the agency
      Task/Delivery Order Ombudsman, there may be protests received when the Ombudsman is in a travel or leave status. In that instance, the
      Ombudsman will begin action on the complaint immediately upon return to the office.

(End of Clause)












H.9   Smoke Free Environment Certification (Feb 2009)

CDC0_H055:  Smoke Free Environment Certification (February 2009)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure poses serious health risks to nonsmokers.
SHS exposure in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk for heart disease and lung cancer among adult nonsmokers. SHS has been
designated as a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) by the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that SHS is an
occupational carcinogen. There is no risk-free level of SHS exposure. Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating
buildings cannot eliminate this exposure.  SHS is an important preventable cause of death from cancer and other illnesses, and many Americans,
both adults and children, remain at significant risk from SHS exposure.

It is the CDC’s intent to protect the health of all CDC employees and reduce cancer and other serious health hazards caused by SHS exposure.
Therefore, all meetings and conferences organized and/or sponsored or co-sponsored by the CDC shall be held in a conference venue that provides
a smoke-free environment. A smoke-free conference venue is defined as a venue that makes ALL public places in the hotel and in all meeting
facilities smoke-free.  This includes, but is not limited to, meeting rooms, common areas such as lobbies and hallways, all indoor public
spaces, all indoor employee work areas, restaurants (including restaurant bar areas), and lounges.

Conferences include symposia, seminars, workshops, and any other organized and formal meeting lasting one or more days, where CDC personnel
assemble to exchange information and views or explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge.

CERTIFICATION: Offeror’s acceptance of any resulting contract certifies that the meeting/conference venue provided is “smoke-free” and that all
CDC personnel attending said meeting/conference will be doing so in a smoke-free environment.

H.10  Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12) Requirements (Mar 2011)


Homeland Security Presidential Directive – 12 (HSPD-12) Requirements


(Contract Clause)

   (a)   To perform the work specified herein, contractor personnel are expected to have routine 1) physical access to an HHS-controlled
   facility; 2) logical access to an  HHS controlled information systems; or 3) access to sensitive HHS data or information, whether in an HHS
   controlled information system or in hard copy.  This contract/order will entail the following position sensitivity level(s): (insert position
   sensitivity level(s))


   (b)   To gain routine physical access to an HHS facility, logical access to an HHS controlled information system, and or access to sensitive
   data or information, the contractor and its employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, Policy for a Common
   Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget Memorandum (M-05-24); Federal Information
   Processing Standards Publication Number 201;  and with the personal identity verification and investigation procedures contained in the
   following documents:


      (1)  HHS Information Security Program Policy


      (2)  HHS Office of Security and Drug Testing, Personnel Security/Suitability
             Handbook, dated February 1, 2005

      (3)  HHS HSPD-12 Policy Document, v. 2.0


      (4)  "IN- AND OUT-PROCESSING OF CDC FTEs, PSCs, CONTRACTORS,
             AND OTHER NON-FTEs" Policy

      (5)  "VISITORS AND FOREIGN NATIONALS IN THE WORKPLACE AT
               CDC" Policy


   (c)  The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that the Contractor prepare and submit background
   check/investigation forms based on the type of investigation required.  The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a
   National Agency Check and Inquiries (with fingerprinting). More restricted positions, above non-sensitive, require more extensive
   documentation and investigation.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in advance when any new personnel, who are subject to a
   background check/investigation, will work under the contract and if they have previously been the subject of national agency checks or
   background investigations.


   (d)  Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections
   and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays--see FAR 52.249-14.    Accordingly,
   the Contractor shall ensure that any additional employees whose names it submits for work under this contract have a reasonable chance for
   approval.

   Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 Requirements

(Solicitation Provision)

   (a)   To perform the work specified herein, contractor personnel are expected to have routine 1) physical access to an HHS-controlled
   facility; 2) logical access to an  HHS controlled information systems; or 3) access to sensitive HHS data or information, whether in an HHS
   controlled information system or in hard copy.  This contract/order will entail the following position sensitivity level(s): (insert position
   sensitivity level(s))


   (b) To gain routine physical access to an HHS facility, logical access to an HHS controlled information system, and or access to sensitive
   data or information, the contractor and its employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, Policy for a Common
   Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget Memorandum (M-05-24); Federal Information
   Processing Standards Publication Number 201;  and with the personal identity verification and investigation procedures contained in the
   following documents:


      (1)  HHS Information Security Program Policy


      (2)  HHS Office of Security and Drug Testing, Personnel Security/Suitability
             Handbook, dated February 1, 2005

      (3)  HHS HSPD-12 Policy Document, v. 2.0


      (4)  "IN- AND OUT-PROCESSING OF CDC FTEs, PSCs, CONTRACTORS,
             AND OTHER NON-FTEs" Policy

      (5)  "VISITORS AND FOREIGN NATIONALS IN THE WORKPLACE AT
               CDC" Policy


   (c)  The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that the Contractor prepare and submit background
   check/investigation forms based on the type of investigation required.  The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a
   National Agency Check and Inquiries (with fingerprinting). More restricted positions, above non-sensitive, require more extensive
   documentation and investigation.  As part of its proposal, and if the anticipated position sensitivity levels are specified above, the Offeror
   shall notify the Contracting Officer of (1) its proposed personnel who will be subject to a background check/investigation and (2) whether any
   of its proposed personnel who will work under the contract have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background
   investigations.


   (d)  Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections
   and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays--see FAR 52.249-14.  Accordingly, if
   position sensitivity levels are specified above, the offeror shall ensure that the employees it proposes for work under this contract have a
   reasonable chance for approval.


   (e)  Multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, justify reduction(s) in the contract price of
   no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).


   (f)  Language similar to this Security section shall be included in any subcontracts which require subcontractor personnel to have the same
   frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; or
   (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS-controlled information system or in hard copy;  access to an information
   system, access to sensitive data, regular or prolonged access to an HHS-controlled facility.


   (g)  Inquiries on matters that affect contract compliance or terms and conditions should be directed to the Contracting Officer or designee.


   (h)  Within seven (7) calendar days after final acceptance of the work specified herein, the contractor shall return all identification badges
   in accordance with CDC's Policy titled "In- And Out-Processing of CDC FTEs, PSCs, Contractors, and Other  Non-FTEs Policy". Contractor
   employees who separate from service under the contract prior to final acceptance shall be out processed in accordance with that same policy.

(c) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the
government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN

K.2  FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that –

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals –

(A) Are  are not  presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;

(B) Have  have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local)
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);;

(C) Are  are not  presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the
offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.

(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds
$3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
           (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
           determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
           liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
           (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
           full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (2) Examples.
           (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
           review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek
           Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
           (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a
           notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and
           to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of
           the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to
           contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court
           review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
           (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is
           in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make
           full payment.
           (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed
           under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has  has not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having
primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or
business segment; and similar positions).

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or
Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of Provision)



K.3  FAR 52.215-6 Place of Performance (Oct 1997)

(a) The offeror or respondent, in the performance of any contract resulting from this solicitation,  intends,  does not intend [check applicable
block] to use one or more plants or facilities located at a different address from the address of the offeror or respondent as indicated in this
proposal or response to request for information.

(b) If the offeror or respondent checks “intends” in paragraph (a) of this provision, it shall insert in the following spaces the required
information:

|Place of Performance(Street Address, City, State, County, Zip    |Name and Address of Owner and Operator of the Plant or Facility  |
|Code)                                                            |if Other Than Offeror or Respondent                              |
|                                                                 |                                                                 |

(End of Provision)



K.4  FAR 52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports (Feb 1999)


The offeror represents that –

(b) It  has,  has not filed all required compliance reports; and

(c) Representations indicating submission of required compliance reports, signed by proposed subcontractors, will be obtained before subcontract
awards.

(End of Provision)



K.5  FAR 52.222-25 Affirmative Action Compliance (Apr 1984)

(a) It  has developed and has on file,  has not developed and does not have on file, at each establishment, affirmative action programs required
by the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (41 CFR 60-1 and 60-2); or

(b) It  has not previously had contracts subject to the written affirmative action programs requirement of the rules and regulations of the
Secretary of Labor.

                               Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts For Maintenance,
                                      Callibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification (Feb 2009)

(a) The offeror shall check the following certification:

                                                                  CERTIFICATION

The offeror  does  does not certify that—

      (1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Government purposes, and are sold or traded
      by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontractor) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of
      normal business operations;
      (2) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance,
      calibration, or repair of equipment.
           (i) An “established catalog price” is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained
           by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at
           which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public.
           (ii) An “established market price” is a current price, established in the usual course of trade between buyers and sellers free to
           bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; and
      (3) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract are the same as that used
      for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to
compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in
paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(c)(3) that the Service Contract Act—
      (1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant
      contract to this offeror; or
      (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for
      Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract
      awarded to this offeror, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis.
(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph
(a) of this provision—
      (1) The clause in this solicitation at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance,
      Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment— Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror; and
      (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act
      wage determination to the solicitation.
(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this
provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.

condition of contracting, submit a Disclosure Statement as required by 48 CFR 9903.202. When required, the Disclosure Statement must be
submitted as a part of the offeror’s proposal under this solicitation unless the offeror has already submitted a Disclosure Statement disclosing
the practices used in connection with the pricing of this proposal. If an applicable Disclosure Statement has already been submitted, the
offeror may satisfy the requirement for submission by providing the information requested in paragraph (c) of Part I of this provision.

      Caution: In the absence of specific regulations or agreement, a practice disclosed in a Disclosure Statement shall not, by virtue of such
      disclosure, be deemed to be a proper, approved, or agreed-to practice for pricing proposals or accumulating and reporting contract
      performance cost data.

(c) Check the appropriate box below:

       (1) Certificate of Concurrent Submission of Disclosure Statement. The offeror hereby certifies that, as a part of the offer, copies of the
      Disclosure Statement have been submitted as follows:


           (i) Original and one copy to the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or cognizant Federal agency official authorized
           to act in that capacity (Federal official), as applicable; and

                 official and/or from the loose-leaf version of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.)


                 Date of Disclosure Statement: __________________
                 Name and Address of Cognizant ACO or Federal
                 Official Where Filed: _________________________

      practices disclosed in the applicable Disclosure Statement.


       (3) Certificate of Monetary Exemption. The offeror hereby certifies that the offeror, together with all divisions, subsidiaries, and
      affiliates under common control, did not receive net awards of negotiated prime contracts and subcontracts subject to CAS totaling $50
      million or more in the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted. The offeror further
      certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer
      immediately.


       (4) Certificate of Interim Exemption. The offeror hereby certifies that –


           (i) the offeror first exceeded the monetary exemption for disclosure, as defined in (3) of this subsection, in the cost accounting
           period immediately preceding the period in which this offer was submitted and


           (ii) in accordance with 48 CFR 9903.202-1, the offeror is not yet required to submit a Disclosure Statement. The offeror further
           certifies that if an award resulting from this proposal has not been made within 90 days after the end of that period, the offeror
           will immediately submit a revised certificate to the Contracting Officer, in the form specified under subparagraph (c)(1) or (c)(2)
           of Part I of this provision, as appropriate, to verify submission of a completed Disclosure Statement.


                 Caution: Offerors currently required to disclose because they were awarded a CAS-covered prime contract or subcontract of $50
                 million or more in the current cost accounting period may not claim this exemption (4). Further, the exemption applies only in
                 connection with proposals submitted before expiration of the 90-day period following the cost accounting period in which the
                 monetary exemption was exceeded.

II. Cost Accounting Standards – Eligibility for Modified Contract Coverage

If the offeror is eligible to use the modified provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and elects to do so, the offeror shall indicate by checking
the box below. Checking the box below shall mean that the resultant contract is subject to the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting
Practices clause in lieu of the Cost Accounting Standards clause.

       The offeror hereby claims an exemption from the Cost Accounting Standards clause under the provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and
      certifies that the offeror is eligible for use of the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause because during the
      cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted, the offeror received less than $50 million in
      awards of CAS-covered prime contracts and subcontracts. The offeror further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting
      from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately.


           Caution: An offeror may not claim the above eligibility for modified contract coverage if this proposal is expected to result in the
           award of a CAS-covered contract of $50 million or more or if, during its current cost accounting period, the offeror has been awarded
           a single CAS-covered prime contract or subcontract of $50 million or more.

III. Additional Cost Accounting Standards Applicable to Existing Contracts
The offeror shall indicate below whether award of the contemplated contract would, in accordance with subparagraph (a)(3) of the Cost Accounting
Standards clause, require a change in established cost accounting practices affecting existing contracts and subcontracts.

L.1  FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008)

Central Contractor Registration (Apr 2008)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause—

“Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database” means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of
business with the Government.

“Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number” means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business
entities.

“Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number” means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a
business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the
business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at
Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.

“Registered in the CCR database” means that—
   (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and
   (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the
   Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record “Active”. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to
   the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database
prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing
agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS +4” followed
by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror’s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the
Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
   (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number—
      (i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-
      866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or
      (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an
      offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
    (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:
      (i) Company legal business.
      (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.
      (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code.
      (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical).
      (v) Company Telephone Number.
      (vi) Date the company was started.
      (vii) Number of employees at your location.
      (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.
      (ix) Line of business (industry).
      (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer
will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.
(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should
consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from
the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the
Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in
the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this
contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(g)
   (1)
      (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract),
      or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and
      change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
      day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12
      of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must
      provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
      paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
      that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within
      the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.


   (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
   assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
   CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate
   recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment”
   paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov
or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(End of clause)

L.2  FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition (Jan 2004)

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision –

“Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, result
in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.”

“In writing,” “writing,” or “written” means any worded or numbered expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and
includes electronically transmitted and stored information.

“Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation’s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or
made to correct a mistake at any time before award.

“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer
as the result of negotiations.

“Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.

(b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall
acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).

(c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

(1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals
shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages

(i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and

(ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using
commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and
(c)(1)(ii) of this provision.

(2) The first page of the proposal must show –

(i) The solicitation number;

(ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);

(iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to

(iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the
offeror’s behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and

the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m.,
local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.

(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified
for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that
accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and –

(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to
the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or

(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(3) It is the only proposal received.

(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered
at any time it is received and may be accepted.

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.

(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated
for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on
the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be
withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before
award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror

proposal before award.

(5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S.
dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for
any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall –

(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:

This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed – in whole or in
part – for for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of – or in
connection with – the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent
provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is
obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other
identification of sheets]; and

(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.

(f) Contract award.

(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s)
represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.

(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in
FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.
The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient
competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the
Government’s best interest to do so.

(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline
items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is
significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or
schedule risk.

(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal
shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:

(i) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.

(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on
the debriefed offeror.

(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.

(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.

(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the
solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

The Government will make best value determinations as part of the evaluation and selection process.  Technical factors will receive paramount
importance in making the award decisions.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than
cost or price. 

A proposal that has no weaknesses and no particular strengths above and beyond meeting the basic requirements defined in the RFP for a
particular evaluation criterion, will receive less than the full credit available on that element.  To achieve the full credit for a criterion,
the proposal must go well beyond the requirement by offering exceptionally innovative or particularly well thought out or insightful methods,
procedures, solutions or new opportunities for major improvements.


Technical Evaluation: Technical proposals will be evaluated within each domain according to the general criteria set forth below. All points
will be relative to the respective domain and total 100 points.

Relative Criteria
    1) Methodology and Approach – 10  points
    2) Corporate Capability – 30 points
    3) Staffing and Management – 20 points
    4) Similar or Previous Experience – 10 points
    5) Sample Tasks – 30 points



Evaluation of Sample Task Order Proposals


The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contracts without discussions with Offerors, except for clarifications, as described in
FAR 15.306(a).Therefore, initial Proposals should contain the Offerors’ best terms from a technical and cost/price standpoint. The Government
reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary.

(End of Provision)


M.2  Relationship between Cost or Price and Technical Strength (May 1998)

Offerors are advised that in the proposal evaluation process, technical merit and other non-cost factors will be more important to cost or
price.

(End of Provision)


M.3  Technical Strength More Important than Cost/Price (Jan 2000)

Offerors are advised that in proposal evaluation paramount consideration shall be given to technical proposals rather than to cost or price
unless, as a result of technical evaluations, proposals are judged to be essentially equal, in which case cost or price shall become the
determining factor. Furthermore, cost/price will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism which is defined as the offeror's ability to project
costs which are reasonable and indicate that the offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed.

Discussions, if held, will be conducted only with those offerors determined to be within the competitive range.

Award shall be made to that responsible offeror submitting the proposal (Technical and Business) determined to be the most advantageous and the
best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Section.
