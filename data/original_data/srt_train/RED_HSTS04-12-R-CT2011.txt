1. Introduction
This Guide provides the standardized process the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Security Technology (OST) will use to develop and apply Reliability, Maintainability, and Availability (RMA) requirements for the acquisition of security equipment. The intent of the guide is to ensure: 1. User requirements are adequately considered through the ORD approval process 2. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acquisition Directive (AD) 102-01 requirements are met 3. RMA terminology, measures and formulas are used consistently throughout the security equipment acquisition process 4. Operational requirements are realistic and have a logical basis 5. Acquisition strategies include provisions to ensure that acquired security equipment will obtain the required operational availability threshold

2. RMA Terminology
OST will use standard RMA metrics for each security equipment acquisition and will apply these metrics in the same way each time in TSA acquisition documentation. AD-102 provides the following standard definitions for RMA. 1. Reliability: The ability of a system to perform its mission without failure, degradation, or demand on the support system. Reliability is a measure of the degree to which a system can complete it primary mission over a given duration. 2. Maintainability: The ability of a system to be retained in, or restored to a specified condition when maintenance is performed by personnel having the specified skill levels, using prescribed procedures and resources, at each prescribed level of maintenance and repair. Maintainability is a characteristic of design, installation, and supportability expressed as a measure of the degree to which a system will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of time, when the maintenance is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures and resources. 3. Availability: A measure of the probability that a system will be in an operable state and can be committed at the start of a mission when the mission is called for at an unknown (random) point in time. 4. Inherent Reliability, Maintainability and Availability (RMA) Value: Any measure of reliability, maintainability or availability that includes only the effects of item design and installation, and assumes an ideal operating and support environment. 5. Operational Reliability, Maintainability or Availability (RMA) Value: Any measure of RMA that includes the combined effects of item design, quality, installation, environment, operation, maintenance, and repair.

Application For evaluation of the operational performance of a technology during OT&E and during O&M For design of a technology and evaluation of its inherent capability during DT&E

Inherent Availability

Inherent (Ai)

1. System Operating Time ­ The period of time a system is available to perform its required mission. In test, equal to the number of hours the system is in operation (net of downtime). During the Operations & Maintenance life cycle phase, airport operational hours (period of time within 24-hour day that an airport is operational) minus downtime will be used as a proxy for system operating time. 2. Critical Failure ­ A failure that causes the system to be non-operational and requires action by the maintenance service provider to restore the system to operation. Events that a TSO can correct via system resets, simple removal of obstructions, etc. are not categorized as critical failures. 3. Level 2 PM ­ These Preventive Maintenance (PM) activities are performed by trained Contra ctor technicians and are performed routinely on a set time schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly). These do not include activities performed by the operator on a more routine basis (e.g., hourly, daily, start up, per shift, etc.) without a need to open the equipment (e.g., wipe machine, replace paper, etc.). 4. Downtime ­ The period of time during which a system is not in a condition to perform its required mission. This includes all times that a system is not available due to corrective, or depot maintenance. Downtime includes the total response and repair time of Contractor technicians. 5. Failure ­ Any unscheduled event that prevents a system from performing a mission function. 6. Corrective Maintenance ­ An action performed by a trained maintenance technician to restore a system to a specified condition. 7. Logistics Delay Time - Includes delay time for spares, support equipment, personnel, facilities, transportation, and administrative activities.

The specific RMA measures applied will depend on whether an inherent or operational value is more appropriate.

3. RMA Requirements in Acquisition Documentation
Various acquisition documents are required throughout the Acquisition Life Cycle. The specific RMA measures that apply depend on whether it describes an operational requirement or an inherent (design and installation related) requirement.

a. Operational RMA Metrics
OST will use three operational metrics; Ao, MTBCF, and MDT. The TSA user community considers Operational Availability a Key Performance Parameter (KPP) to support their need for equipment availability for screening operations. OST will document the Ao requirement in the ORD, specify it as a KPP in the APB, and will evaluate it during OT&E and throughout the O&M phase.

8

Reliability is the measure that determines the frequency of system failures or maintenance actions and supports the user need for satisfactory performance for a given period of time. OST will document the MTBCF requirement in the ORD, and will evaluate it during OT&E and throughout the O&M phase. Maintainability supports the user's need to rapidly restore security equipment to operational status following a failure. MDT measures the combined operational impact of a technology's maintainability design and the effectiveness of the logistics support system. OST will document the MDT requirement in the security equipment ORD, and will evaluate it during OT&E and throughout the O&M phase.

b. Inherent RMA Metrics
OST will use four metrics to define the inherent RMA requirements for security equipment; A i, MTBCF, MTBPM and MTTR. All inherent RMA requirements will be evaluated during DT&E. MTBCF and MTBPM will be the reliability requirements specified in the FRD. The MTBCF requirement will be the same value from the ORD. The MTBPM requirement will define the minimum acceptable time period (days) between scheduled Level 2 preventive maintenance (Contractor-performed). MTTR will be the maintainability requirement specified in the FRD, and OST will derive the A i requirement directly from the MTBCF and MTTR requirement through the formula in Table 2.

4. RMA Metric Development
OST will use a standard methodology and process for developing the different RMA requirements. Threshold and Objective values will be set for each requirement (except MTBPM) to document the performance levels that meet the following definitions:   Threshold - the minimum operational performance, in the user's judgment, that TSA is willing to accept Objective ­ a level of performance significantly beyond the threshold that represents desired performance.

a. Operational RMA Metrics
The logical basis for developing the Operational RMA requirements is the user need and historical RMA performance data from security equipment currently in operation. Following are the steps that OST will use to develop the RMA Operational metrics documented in the security equipment ORD.

9

Step 1: In coordination with the user, establish a uniform Availability Ao Threshold and Objective KPP for all security equipment procured under either the Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) or the Passenger Screening Program (PSP). The Ao Threshold represents the minimum acceptable percentage of time the user considers that security equipment must be available for screening. The Ao Objective represents a desired performance level based on historical limits experienced by other OST security equipment. The availability Threshold will be stated as a percentage; the Objective as a  percentage value. Step 2: OST will evaluate historical maintenance down time data of similar type security equipment currently in operation to establish an MDT Threshold. The MDT Threshold represents the maximum acceptable down time given the existing Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) concept and contracts. Step 3: OST will derive the MTBCF Threshold by substituting the A o and MDT values from Steps 1 and 2 above into the formula Ao = MTBCF / (MTBCF + MDT). The MTBCF Threshold represents the minimum permissible time between critical failures or maintenance actions that will permit the security equipment to meet availability requirements. Step 4: OST will evaluate historical RMA performance data of all security equipment in operation to establish the one best possible MDT Objective consistent with existing Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contracts. The MDT Objective represents a significant maintainability performance improvement of interest to TSA users within affordability constraints. Step 5: OST will determine the MTBCF Objective for each new security equipment technology based on historical RMA performance data from similar type security equipment, and ensure the MTBCF Objective and MDT Objective meets or exceeds the desired Ao Objective from Step 1. The MTBCF Objective represents the desired performance levels. The following table demonstrates how these steps would be used for the development of the Threshold (T) and Objective (O) RMA Operational metrics. Availability (Ao) thresholds and objectives (Column A and B) are set by the user. Maintainability (MDT) requirements (Columns E and F) are established using historical information. Having these two sets of requirements allows the derivation of the Reliability requirements (MTBCF ­ columns C and D). The derivation is simply the Availability divided by (1 minus Availability) times MDT. Notional examples for two fictitious technologies (Technology X and Y) are provided.

b. Inherent RMA Metrics
A logical basis for developing inherent RMA requirements is to derive appropriate metrics from the ORD requirement or from historical RMA performance data for security equipment currently in operation. Following are the steps that OST will use to develop the inherent RMA metrics that will be documented in the FRD. Step 1: OST will use the MTBCF Thresholds and Objectives from the ORD as inherent reliability requirements in the FRD. The MTBCF Threshold represents the minimum permissible time between critical failures or maintenance actions that will permit the security equipment to meet availability requirements. The MTBCF Objective represents the desired performance levels. For the MTBPM inherent reliability requirement, OST will coordinate with security equipment users to determine the minimum acceptable time period (days) between scheduled Level 2 preventive maintenance (Contractor-performed). This MTBPM requirement will be specified in the FRD. Step 2: OST will evaluate historical maintainability data of all security equipment currently in operation and establish a uniform MTTR Threshold for all future security equipment. The MTTR Threshold represents the maximum acceptable corrective maintenance time after a critical failure. It does not include repair delay times such as field technician response time, lead time for parts not readily available, or other administrative or logistics downtimes . Step 3: OST will evaluate the historical maintainability data of all security equipment in operation and determine a uniform MTTR Objective for all future security equipment. The MTTR Objective represents an inherent maintainability design goal. Step 4: OST will derive an Inherent Availability (Ai) Threshold and Objective for each new security equipment technology from the MTBCF and MTTR values specified. The Ai Threshold represents the inherent availability with respect only to operating time and corrective maintenance. The Ai Objective represents an inherent availability design goal. The following table demonstrates how these steps would be used for the development of the Threshold (T) and Objective (O) RMA Inherent metrics. Reliability (MTBCF) thresholds and objectives (Column C and D) are taken from the ORD (having been established as described above). Maintainability (MTTR) requirements (Columns E and F) are established using historical 11

information. Having these two sets of requirements allows the derivation of the Availability requirements (Ai - columns A and B). The derivation is simply the Reliability divided by Reliability plus Maintainability. Notional examples for two fictitious technologies (Technology X and Y) are provided.

5. RMA Testing
The fundamental purpose of Test & Evaluation (T&E) will be to verify attainment of technical performance in DT&E before acquisition, and required operational effectiveness and suitability during OT&E. DT&E will focus on the verification of inherent system RMA technical performance assuming an ideal operating and support environment (e.g. trained operators, readily-available logistics support resources). DT&E will verify the RMA technical requirements in the FRD (e.g. MTBCF, MTTR, and Ai). OT&E will be a field test of the security equipment under realistic conditions with users who represent those expected to operate and maintain the equipment when it is deployed. As such, it will consider the effects of the environment, operators, and the logistics support system as part of the test. RMA data collection during OT&E will focus on identifying what fails, the condition under which the failure occurs, and what it takes to get the system operating again. Historical logistics response times, for the specific airport locations selected for operational testing, will be used to realistically depict logistics support performance during OT&E. OT&E will verify RMA performance requirements in the ORD (e.g., MTBCF, MDT, and A o).

6. RMA Process Control
OST will adopt acquisition strategies and contract provisions to ensure that delivered security equipment will attain the required Operational Availability Threshold, and to demonstrate the program office's commitment to meeting user objectives. In those cases where a vendor does not meet the Threshold requirement during testing, but compelling operational needs dictate 12

acquisition and deployment; OST will withhold funds from the procurement contract until the deployed security equipment meets or exceeds the RMA Threshold requirement. This may include a vendor initiated reliability improvement program to improve the performance of the security equipment through Engineering Change Proposals (ECP). Any RMA improvement measures will be tracked, measured and reported. In addition, OST will explore the use of incentives in the security equipment procurement contract to drive performance toward the RMA Objective.

7. Supportability and Sustainment
Effective supportability and sustainment includes integrating supportability requirements into the systems engineering process ­ "designing for support" and developing and obtaining an integrated systems support package (e.g. spares, support equipment, tech manuals, etc.) ­ "supporting the design." Supportability is influenced through the application of effective RMA requirements on system procurement contracts. Logisticians will collaborate with Engineers to develop RMA requirements that promote system performance and maintainability performance through supportable designs. Sustainment planning is driven by system availability requirements in the ORD and the inherent supportability capabilities of technologies. Sustainment activities are implemented through Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contracts, which are performance-based and specify an appropriate RMA measure as their essential contract performance requirement. The CLS contracts include penalties if the contractor does not meet the established RMA performance requirement in the CLS contract. Contracting Officer's Technical Representatives (COTR) will assess CLS performance monthly to ensure Contractors are meeting contract performance requirements. OST will use Ao as the performance requirement for CLS contracts with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). MDT will be the CLS contract performance requirement for third party Maintenance Service Providers (MSP) that have no control over the inherent reliability and maintainability performance of a technology. MSPs will be required to document every maintenance action and report them to OST for evaluation to determine whether contract performance requirements are met and to monitor and assess actual versus expected security equipment performance. OST will continually evaluate the performance of deployed equipment throughout the O&M Phase to identify supportability issues, identify potential reliability improvements, or assist in recapitalization planning.

1.0 AIT-2 SYSTEMS (CLIN 0001)

This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for the design, manufacture, test, test support and delivery of the second-generation Advanced Imaging Technology, hereinafter referred to as the AIT2 system. The AIT-2 system includes Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability that eliminates the need for images of individuals to be reviewed by an Image Operator (IO). AIT-2 will have enhanced threat detection capabilities and increased passenger throughput. This SOW will reflect two configuration options for development, either a full size system or a reduced size system. Reduced-sized systems will be offered as an alternative to full-size systems to help reduce the AIT-2s overall footprint for smaller checkpoint configurations. Tier II is the minimum requirement for AIT-2 systems. The Contractor shall provide AIT-2 systems in accordance with this SOW and the requirements specified in the AIT-2 Functional Requirements Document (FRD). The AIT-2 systems shall include two Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phases, and Full Rate Production (FRP). The first full rate production system shall be used for first article testing. This system shall be maintained under strict Configuration Management (CM) and will be designated as the "Gold Standard" for the FRP. 1.1 Background

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is charged with the mission of protecting the nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. The mission of TSA's Office of Security Capabilities (OSC) is to develop and implement the best procedures and technologies that deter, prevent, and/or render ineffective any attempt to sabotage commerce and transportation. AIT-2 provides Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) additional threat detection capabilities to locate potential threats concealed from view on a passenger. The system displays metallic and non-metallic anomalies such as weapons, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) components and plastic threats. 1.2 Applicable Documents

(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because contractor-provided EFT information in the CCR database was incorrect, or was revised within 30 calendar days at the time of TSA release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and:

49

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, then the TSA is deemed to have made payment and the contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, then the TSA retains the right to either make payment by mail or suspend the payment in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. (g) EFT and prompt payment. (1) A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the Prompt Payment clause of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction given to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (2) When payment cannot be made by EFT because of incorrect EFT information provided by the contractor to the CCR database, no interest penalty is due after the date of the uncompleted or erroneous payment transaction, provided that notice of the defective EFT information is issued to the contractor within 7 calendar days after the TSA is notified of the defective EFT information. (h) EFT and assignment of claims. If the contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the Assignment of Claims clause of this contract, the contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the contractor. EFT information, which shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the TSA, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (i) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The contractor agrees that the contractor's financial agent may notify the TSA of a change to the routing transit number, contractor account number, or account type. The TSA shall use the changed data in accordance with paragraph (d) (2) of this clause. The contractor agrees that the information provided by the agent is deemed to be correct information as if it were provided by the contractor. The contractor agrees that the agent's notice of changed EFT data is deemed to be a request by the contractor in accordance with paragraph (d) (2) that no further payments be made until the changed EFT information is implemented by the payment office. The TSA is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the contractor's financial agent.

The TSA may enter into contractual agreements with other contractors (i.e., "associate contractors") in order to fulfill requirements separate from the work to be performed under this contract, yet having a relationship to performance under this contract. It is expected that contractors working under TSA contracts will have to work together under certain conditions in order to achieve a common solution for TSA. The contractor may be required to coordinate with other such contractor(s) through the cognizant Contracting Officer (CO) and/or designated representative in providing suitable, non-conflicting technical and/or management interface and in avoidance of duplication of effort. Information on deliverables provided under separate contracts may, at the discretion of the TSA and/or other Government agencies, be provided to such other contractor(s) for the purpose of such work. Where the contractor and an associate contractor fail to agree upon action to be taken in connection with their respective responsibilities, each contractor shall promptly bring the matters to the attention of the cognizant CO and furnish the Contractor's recommendations for a solution. The contractor shall not be relieved of its obligations to make timely deliveries or be entitled to any other adjustment because of failure of the contractor and its associate to promptly refer matters to the CO or because of failure to implement CO directions. Where the contractor and associate contractors are required to collaborate to deliver a service; the Government will designate, in writing and prior to the definition of the task, to both contractors, a "lead contractor" for the project.

Observance of such holidays by Government personnel shall not be a reason for the contractor to request

56

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011
an extension of the period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract. In the event the contractor's personnel work during the holiday or other excused absences, they may be compensated by the contractor, however, no form of holiday or other premium compensation will be considered either as a direct or indirect cost, other than their normal compensation for the time worked. For cost reimbursable and time and material (T&M) contracts, the Government will only consider as direct and/or indirect costs those efforts actually performed during the holiday or excused absences in the event contractor personnel are not dismissed. This provision does not preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work if applicable to this contract. H.15 NON-PERSONAL SERVICES

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its employees working on this contract are informed of the substance of this clause. Nothing in this special contract requirement shall limit the Government's rights in any way under any other term of the contract, including those related to the Government's right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this contract. The substance of this special contract requirement shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier. H.16 QUALIFICATIONS OF EMPLOYEES

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011
(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the Offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with Offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting Offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed Offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed Offeror and past performance information on the debriefed Offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all Offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (iv) A summary of the rationale for award.

Oral Presentation Logistics and Groundrules

ˇ

L.4.3.1.1

Schedule/Location: After the solicitation closes, the Government will schedule oral presentations with Offerors who submit timely submissions of Volume I, II, and III. The date and time for oral presentations will be scheduled by random drawing, and the Government will notify each Offeror of its assigned date and time. Oral presentations are tentatively scheduled to occur the week of April 23, 2012, subject to change. Government reserves the right to reschedule oral presentations at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer if necessary. Oral presentations will be held at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA or by teleconference. Presentation Materials: TSA will not be recording the presentation. All Offerors shall document the oral presentations on briefing slides, not to exceed fifty (50) slides, and provide six (6) printed copies of the slides at the time of the oral presentation. These briefing slides will form the record of oral presentations. The Government will not accept for evaluation any additional documentation (such as procedures, manuals, administrative handbooks or guides, etc.), which may or may not have been referenced during the presentation. Submission of video tapes or other forms of media containing the presentation for evaluation, in lieu of the oral presentation, will be rejected.

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011

** The oral presentation shall not constitute discussions as defined in FAR 15.306 as the Government reserves the right to award without discussions L.4.3.2 Volume 2: Past Performance and Socio-Economic Considerations Factor 2: Past Performance Offeror shall provide information on at least three, but no more than five, previous Government contracts it performed recently (in-progress or completed within the last three years) that are relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. If the Offeror has not had three Government contracts within the last three years, it may submit information on relevant Government subcontracts and/or commercial contracts instead. Relevant past performance is performance which is similar in terms of size, scope and/or complexity to the requirements of this solicitation. Offerors who describe similar contracts and subcontracts shall provide (1) a detailed explanation demonstrating the similarity of the contracts to the requirements of this solicitation; (2) a detailed description of the work performed for the contract; (3) the role performed, including whether the Offeror acted as a prime Contractor or a Subcontractor; and (4) points of contact for the Contractor's customer. Offerors may also submit past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have performed under relevant contracts, and Subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement as a past performance submission(s). Offerors may submit information on key management personnel, major subcontractors, work performed as part of a team or joint venture, and other previous iterations of its current organization. If a reference is for a segment of the firm (division, group, and unit) other than the offeror, the offeror shall explain that segment's proposed role. If past performance as a subcontractor is submitted, the Offeror shall describe only the subcontractor's work under the subcontract, not the entire scope of work as performed by the prime contractor. Offerors shall submit this information with their offer in the format provided in Attachment J.4 (Past Performance Data). Failure to submit the completed attachment shall be considered certification that the Contractor has no past performance for similar contracts for the Government to evaluate. For each of the past performance contracts the Offeror describes in its offer via Attachment J.4 (Past Performance Data), the Offeror shall request that a reference from the agency/company that awarded the contract completes Attachment J.5 (Past Performance Questionnaire) for that contract. The reference (not the Offeror) shall then e-mail the completed Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment J.5) before the offer deadline directly to Lance.Nyman@dhs.gov and Polly.Hall@dhs.gov. The Government (1) reserves the right to consider questionnaires received after the due date of the solicitation, contact references for past performance analysis purposes, and consider other relevant past performance information; and (2) does not assume the duty to search for data to cure any problems it finds in the information provided by the Offeror ­ the burden of providing thorough and/or complete past performance information remains with the Offeror.

L.5 OFFEROR ACCESS TO SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION (SSI) NECESSARY FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION A. Background. Sensitive Security Information (SSI) may be available to Offerors in preparing responses to this acquisition. Potential Offerors must obtain specific authorization in order to obtain SSI. SSI will not be available or otherwise provided or disclosed to any person not specifically authorized to receive it. SSI provided under this acquisition may only be used to satisfy acquisition requirements. B. Senior Corporate Official. Each Offeror (and subcontractor/team member) must separately designate in writing to the Contracting Officer a single, corporate official who will serve as the single point of contact for sensitive information. This individual must certify that all appropriate protections will be followed, only authorized individuals will have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information. This official must also certify to the Contracting Officer every 60 days that all appropriate protections have been followed, only authorized individuals have access to the sensitive information, and that those individuals with access adequately understand their responsibilities to protect the information. A copy of this certification shall also be emailed to RFP.Access@tsa.dhs.gov. This official will also ensure that the Contracting Officer is notified of staffing changes or circumstances in which individuals no longer need access to the information. C. Offeror Responsibility. The Contracting Officer will review the Excluded Parties List, Dunn and Bradstreet, and the Central Contractor Registry to ensure that the corporate entity would not otherwise be precluded from receiving a contract award. While this review does not replace the responsibility determination required by FAR Part 9, it may prohibit Offerors from receiving SSI information during the solicitation phase of the acquisition. D. Criteria for Release. As part of this acquisition, SSI may only be accessed by individuals which have successfully passed a Security Threat Assessment. This assessment may include a verification of site facility clearance in the National Industrial Security Program (NISP), contractor suitability determination or other federal background investigation, individual security clearance(s), and if required, a criminal history records check (CHRC) and/or a check against terrorism databases. E. Information Requirements. Consistent with the criteria release described above, Offeror's Senior Corporate Officials must provide the appropriate information to the TSA as identified below. Note that this requirement applies likewise to any prospective subcontractor, joint venture partner, or "team" company whose access to the specified SSI and consequent input into the planned proposal is necessary to prepare and complete the proposal. All information must be emailed to RFP.Access@tsa.dhs.gov. (1) Senior Corporate Officials shall provide the Contracting Officer via email with the CAGE code of the Offeror's facility that will manage the proposal, company DUNS number, and address; and Senior Corporate Officials shall provide the following information for all employees who require access to SSI in a single password protected Microsoft Excel spreadsheet emailed to the Contracting Officer. The password for the password protected spreadsheet shall be sent to the Contracting Officer in a separate email, at the same time.  Employee Full Name:  Employee Gender:

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011
   

Employee Birth Date: Employee Citizenship: Social Security Number: Indication of whether any nominated employees have: o Previously received a TSA suitability determination; o Undergone a federal background investigation; or o Possess an individual security clearance

Offerors are limited to 35 employees, inclusive of subcontractors, who can have access to SSI. All information must be emailed to Lance.Nyman@dhs.gov and Polly.Hall@dhs.gov, in one (1) submission. If an Offeror would like to view SSI for this solicitation and has not already submitted its information under the presolicitation notice, it must send all information no later than 6 March 2012, 3:00PM (Eastern). Offerors which submitted information under the pre-solicitation may make one update to the list of employees prior to this time. Offerors are responsible for submitting all vetting information for both themselves and all subcontractors to the Government in one submission. F. Privacy Act Statement. TSA will use the information provided to conduct a security threat assessment on individuals who seek access to Sensitive Security Information (SSI). The information will be shared within DHS with personnel who need the information to perform their official duties. Additionally, DHS may share the information with law enforcement, intelligence, or other government agencies as necessary to identify and respond to potential or actual threats to transportation security in accordance with the routine uses identified in the applicable Privacy Act system of records notice (SORN), DHS/TSA 002, Transportation Security Threat Assessment System (T-STAS). This SORN was last published in the Federal Register on November 8, 2005, and can be found at 70 FR 67731- 67735. Authority: 49 USC 114. Furnishing this information is voluntary. However, failure to furnish the requested information may delay or prevent the completion of your security threat assessment, without which you may not be granted access to the SSI. G. Notification of Assessment. If it is determined that covered individuals are not eligible to receive access to particular SSI based on the threat assessment, TSA will provide the individuals and company point of contact a written determination that provides notification that the individual does not qualify to receive SSI. Appeal of the determination will not be permitted due to the time sensitive nature of the acquisition process, however, the potential Offeror may nominate another individual to receive SSI access. In the event that an individual is determined to be a security threat and the individual believes that the results of the screening are inaccurate, he or she will be informed by TSA on how to pursue redress from TSA, however due to the demanding acquisition schedule, TSA will not delay an acquisition to resolve redress issues. H. Non-Disclosure Agreements. Each Offeror employee requesting access to SSI as specified herein will be required to execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (DHS Form 11000-6). The executed forms shall be provided with and as part of the submission of information reflected in Paragraph E above. The Offeror should understand that employees granted access to SSI and signing a non-disclosure agreement are bound by the terms of that agreement indefinitely, notwithstanding their employment status or any other background checks or clearances granted by any Government agency. I. Return of SSI. Any SSI provided to the Offeror must be returned to the Government upon request. Any Offeror not returning SSI provided directly to them will be subject to penalties as prescribed by law and otherwise rendered ineligible for further consideration in the evaluation. (End of Provision)

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011
L.6 CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CNSI) A contractor must possess a Defense Security Service-issued (DSS) Facility Clearance (FCL) before they are allowed access to classified national security information (CNSI). No exceptions can be made to this rule. Additionally, a contractor must possess a valid DD Form 254, "Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification", for all contracts that require access to CNSI. The DD Form 254 is provided by the Government Contracting Agency (GCA) or Prime Contractor, upon subcontracting. An FCL is comprised of: Status, Access-level, and Safeguarding-level. ˇ ˇ ˇ Status shows whether the FCL is active, in-process, or terminated. Access denotes approval for CNSI access at an specified level. Safeguarding list whether a specified level of CNSI may be stored at the CAGE CODE location.

TSA will not grant any contractor access to classified information unless the contractor possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Facility Clearance (FCL) and DD Form 254, "Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification," provided by the Department of Homeland Security. The DD Form 254 will be water-marked, "For Solicitation Only" allowing the contractor to view classified information at TSA Headquarters; however, note taking, recording and/or removing classified information at TSA Headquarters is prohibited. Alternatively, if block 1.B of the DD Form 254 is annotated "SECRET", contractor may request mailing of the classified information to its cleared facility listed on the DD Form 254. TSA will use contractor's CAGE CODE to verify FCL within DSS' Industrial Security Facility Database (ISFD). Contractors having no valid ISFD record will not have access or receive classified information.

The Contractor will be required to access classified material at the contractor's facility. The Contractor will store and safeguard classified material in accordance with Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information, and its Implementing Directive 32 CFR Part 2001 at the SECRET level in support of program office requirements. Additionally, in accordance with the Department of Defense (DOD) Manual 5220.22-M, "National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for Safeguarding Classified Information," Chapter 5, Section 5-502, the contractor is authorized to disclose TSA classified information to cleared subcontractors when access is necessary to perform tasks or services for fulfillment of a prime or sub- contract. In accordance with the NISPOM, Chapter 5, Section 5-506, the contractor shall not disclose classified information received or generated under this TSA contract to any other Federal agency unless specifically authorized in writing by the TSA Program Office that has classification management jurisdiction over the information and the TSA COTR. In accordance with the NISPOM, Chapter 5, Section 5-509, the contractor shall not disclose classified information to another contractor except to support a contract, subcontract or other TSA purpose.

SECTION M- EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1 Basis for Contract Award ­ Best Value

The Government anticipates award, if any, of either a single or multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) resulting from this solicitation to the compliant and responsible Offeror(s) whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on a "Best Value" determination. The Government will make a "Best Value" determination by utilizing the trade-off method. The trade-off method enables the Government to conduct an integrated assessment of both non-price and price elements in each proposal. The Government desires that offers are identical to, or conform closely with, the terms set forth in this Solicitation. To the extent an Offeror takes exception to a Government term or proposes additional or alternate terms, that Offeror runs the risk that the Government finds such an offer nonconforming and/or unacceptable. Nonconforming offers will be evaluated as posing additional risk to the Government. Offerors should consider this when readying proposals and submitting offers. The Government reserves the right to award to an Offeror(s) that do not meet all solicitation requirements if it otherwise represents the best value to the Government. Proposals that do not conform to all RFP requirements in this solicitation may be rejected without further evaluation, deliberation, or discussion. Proposals that are so deficient as to be not considered for award may be deemed ineligible for further consideration. The Government has the right to not consider a proposal for award if the Offeror receives an unacceptable rating in any factor. In accordance with FAR 15.306(a)(3), the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if in the best interest of the Government. Also, per FAR 15, a competitive range will be established if in the best interest of the Government. The competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria stated in Section M, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency. After evaluating all proposals, the Contracting Officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. If the Contracting Officer determines that an Offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal shall be eliminated from consideration for an award. Any reduction will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful Offerors. Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may request a debriefing. The request for a debriefing must be made in writing to lance.nyman@dhs.gov and polly.hall@dhs.gov, and must be within three (3) calendar days of notice. After receipt of request confirmation, appointment time and date, and instructions will be provided as soon as possible. TSA reserves the right to conduct these debriefs at a time of its discretion. M.2 Delivery Order Award Approach The first delivery order under the single or multiple IDIQ contract(s) will be for two (2) LRIP systems and support for QT&E testing under CLIN 0001A. After delivery of LRIP systems and completion of CLIN 0001A, the Government plans to award a second delivery order for three (3) LRIP systems and support for OT&E testing under CLIN 0001B. After successful completion of OT&E, the Government intends to issue an RFQ or RFP to award the full rate production systems under CLIN 0001C. In the event of multiple awards, the contracting officer intends to provide each awardee a fair opportunity in accordance with FAR 16.505(b) to be considered for each order.

M.3.1 Evaluation Factors The Government will evaluate proposals utilizing the following evaluation factors: Factor 1. Factor 2. Factor 3: Technical Approach (Factor 1) ­ written proposal and oral presentation Past Performance (Factor 2) Socio-economic Considerations (Factor 3) Subfactor 1 ­ DHS Mentor-Protégé Program Price (Factor 4)

Factor 4.

M.3.2 Relative Order of Importance The non-price evaluation Factors 1-3 (Technical Approach, Past Performance and Socio-economic Considerations) are ranked in descending order of importance and collectively are significantly more important than evaluation Factor 4 (Price). M.3.3 Adjectival Ratings The Government will assign adjectival ratings to each evaluation factor and subfactor, except Factor 4 (Price). M.4 Evaluation Methodology

M.4.1 Volume I, Technical Approach (Factor 1) The Government will evaluate Technical Approach (written proposal and oral presentation) by assessing the following:

100

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

The ability of the Offeror to meet current and future detection tiers. The ability of the Offeror to meet processing time requirements. The production capability of the Offeror, including the ability to scale up and scale down production. The capability of the Offeror's AIT-2 system to be upgraded and integrated with other technologies. The useability of the system (ease with which a user can learn to operate, prepare inputs for, and interpret outputs of the system). The strength of the Offeror's subcontractor and teaming relationships. The ability to meet the requirements under this contract, which includes all contract deliverables outlined in the Statement of Work as well as all performance characteristics and "shalls" outlined in the Functional Requirements Document (Attachment J.2).

M.4.2 Volume II, Past Performance (Factor 2) The past performance evaluation will examine the extent to which the Offeror's past performance demonstrates its ability and likelihood of successful contract performance. In assessing relevance of past performance, the Government will consider relevant contracts as those contracts that are ongoing or completed within the last three (3) years having comparable level of size, scope, and/or complexity to the requirements of the solicitation. The Government will evaluate Past Performance by assessing the following: 1. Evaluation of the history of developing and delivering high quality services/products in the areas described in the RFP (or areas similar to those described in the functional requirements document) especially for organizations that are large-scale and/or primarily Governmental in nature (such as State, local, or Federal Government entities). 2. Evaluation of fulfillment of contract requirements and technical excellence. This includes meeting or exceeding past contract requirements, use of appropriate personnel, timeliness of Offeror against the schedule of deliverables, and demonstrated technical excellence. 3. Evaluation of cost control, business relations, management of key personnel, utilization of small business and other areas as applicable. The Government reserves the right to obtain and utilize information from sources other than those identified by the Offeror, such as PPIRS and knowledgeable Government and/or other sources. Lack of sufficient relevant past performance, or lack of sufficient past performance information, will result in the assignment in a neutral rating. A neutral rating indicates neither a favorable nor unfavorable evaluation for this factor. M.4.3 Volume II Socio-Economic Considerations (Factor 3) The Government will evaluate each Offeror's socio-economic status and the proposed extent of participation of socio-economic concerns in performing the contract. Small business Offerors will receive the highest rating under this factor. In evaluating any required subcontracting plan, the Government will: 1. Evaluate the plan for adequacy in accordance with FAR 19.704.

101

HSTS04-12-R-CT2011
2. Evaluate the plan based on the extent to which the goals listed in Section L.4.3.2 are met. DHS Mentor-Protégé Program (Factor 3, Subfactor 1): Participating in the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program in accordance with HSAR Clause 3052.219-71 and providing a signed letter of mentor-protégé agreement approval from the DHS Office of Small Business and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) shall be favorably considered in the evaluation of this Factor. M.4.4 Volume III, Price Proposal (Factor 4)

The Government expects adequate price competition to establish fair and reasonable pricing. Also, the Government may utilize one or more of the price analysis techniques specified in FAR 15.404-1. Unrealistically low (high or unbalanced) pricing, in the initial or revised proposal, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an unrealistic proposal. The Government will calculate the Offeror's total evaluated price by: ˇ For CLIN 0001C­ Multiplying the Government-provided estimated quantity identified in Attachment J.3 (Part A) by the proposed unit price for each corresponding Contract Line Item Number quantity tier in Attachment J.3 (Part C) and Government-estimated probabilities corresponding to each quantity tier. For CLINs 0004 and 0005 ­ Multiplying proposed labor rates for each corresponding labor category in Attachment J.3 (Part B) by Government-estimated annual labor hours per labor category, to find total estimated labor, then allocating 40% to CLIN 0004 and 60% to CLIN 0005. For all other CLINs ­ Multiplying the Government-provided estimated quantities identified in Attachment J.3 (Part A) by the proposed unit price for each corresponding Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number. Summing the prices above. (End of Section M)
