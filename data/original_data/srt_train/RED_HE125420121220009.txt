EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Specifically, the Government will use a best value basis with tradeoff procedures for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the quotes: Technical, Past Performance, and Price. The order of importance of these factors is: Technical, Past Performance and Price. When combined Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than price. The government is using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for this procurement. Evaluation Factors: Factor 1: Technical Capability/Quality of Services. Vendors will be evaluated on how well they demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement as set forth in the PWS, as well as on the general quality of the proposed services. Factor 2: Past Performance: Vendor's Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the vendor's likelihood of success on the present requirement. Factor 3: Price: Price will be evaluated to ensure price reasonableness. Price will be considered by the Government when determining the best value quote. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Addendum to Provision: (c) If the subject solicitation has been issued as a Request for Quotation, all references to offer and offeror are hereby changed to quote and vendor respectively, except for in paragraph (c), which stands as written. If a quote is provided, the Government may make an offer based on all or part of a vendor's quote, as originally presented or as subsequently modified. (d) Evaluation: Quotes submitted in response to the RFQ will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in FAR 52.212-2. It is imperative that the vendor respond directly to each area specified and ensure their quote is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion of the quote from further consideration. Responses that merely repeat the PWS cannot be considered as being responsive to the requirements of the PWS. Assurances of experience, capability, or qualifications without a clear demonstration to support the claim may adversely influence the evaluation of the quote. (e) Award: The Government intends to award this requirement on a Best Value Basis in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Part 13, and Part 19. The award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable vendor whose quote submission provides the Best Value (Price and Technical Factors considered) to the Government.
