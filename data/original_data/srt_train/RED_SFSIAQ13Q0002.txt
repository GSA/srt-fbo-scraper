(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

Factor 1: Quality (Technical) 1. Submit the proposed audiovisual upgrade solution demonstrating the capability to provide the services as described in the SOW. This factor will be evaluated based on the quality of the products offered and the ability of the contractor to deliver a design consistent with existing classrooms so that all FSI classrooms will operate and look similar to the user no matter what room they use. The proposed equipment and structures must have equivalent features and functionalities to the current refurbished rooms (FSI will show examples on the site visit); 2. 3. Management approach to fulfill this requirement; Quality Assurance Plan;

4. The additional requirements set in the statement of work, such as the detailed breakdown of proposed products and their place of manufacturing.

Factor 2: Past Performance The Offeror shall identify three (3) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance. Recent is defined as within the last three years. Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude of the work described in this Statement of Work.

In addition the offeror shall provide the Past Performance Questionnaire (attached in this solicitation) to each of the three entities described above and shall ask each to complete and return the questionnaire as the indicated in the instructions.

The Government may also consider information obtained through other sources. Past performance information will be utilized to determine the quality of the contractor's past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort.

Factor 3: Price

A contract may be awarded to other than the lowest priced proposal. FSI seeks the best overall value. However, in cases where proposals are technically equivalent or substantially similar, cost or price may become the determining selection factor.

FSI reserves the right to schedule interviews/oral presentations with offerors. These interviews/oral presentations will be at the expense of the offeror. 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) 01/01/1999

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Please see section M.1. for the evaluation facotrs. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
