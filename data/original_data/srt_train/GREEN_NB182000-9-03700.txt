Se-12 Can audit information and audit tools be protected from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion?  Audit information includes all information (e.g. audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. X
Se-13 Does the application obscures feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals (displaying asterisks when a user types in a password is an example of obscuring feedback)? X
Se-14 Does the application protects the integrity of transmitted information by implementing controls such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), IPsec, DNS message authentication and integrity verification, SSH, VPN, etc.? X
Se-15 Does the application protects the confidentiality of transmitted information by implementing controls such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), IPsec, SSH, VPN, etc.? X
Se-16 Does the application terminate a network connection at the end of a session or after a system-defined period of inactivity?  X
Se-17 Does the application implements cryptographic mechanisms that comply with applicable laws, policies, directives, standards, guidance, etc. (the current applicable federal standard for non-national security systems is FIPS 140-2)? X
Se-18 Does the application provides mechanisms to protect the authenticity of communications sessions?   X
Se-19 Does the application checks information for accuracy, completeness, validity, and authenticity as close to the point of origin as possible?  Rules for checking the valid syntax of inputs (e.g., character set length, numerical range, acceptable values, drop-down lists, checksums, hashes, etc.) are in place to verify that inputs match specified definitions for format and content.  Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.  X
Se-20 Does the application identifies and handles error conditions in an expeditious manner without providing information that could be exploited by adversaries?

• Error messages are revealed only to authorized personnel (e.g., system administrators, maintenance personnel, etc.)

• Error messages generated by the system provide timely and useful information without revealing potentially harmful information that could be used by adversaries (e.g., a message about a failed logon should not indicate that the user name was correct and only the password was not valid). 

• Information that is moderate for confidentiality are not listed in error logs or associated error messages.   X
