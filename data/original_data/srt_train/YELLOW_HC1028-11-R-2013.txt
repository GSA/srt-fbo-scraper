|The ACL for this project is 100% for those items with a performance threshold of “No Mission Critical Shortfall.”  This is due to the      |
|critical nature of the service provided for these mainframe operations.  For all other areas, the AQL is 90%.                              |


9.  Place of Performance.  Work will be performed at the DISA OKC facilities, located on Tinker AFB, OK (Zip Code 73145-3352) and also at DECC
St Louis (Zip Code 63120-0012).  The primary shift for the performance of duties under this order will be 7X24X365.

Alternate Place of Performance - Contingency Only.  Contractor employees may be required to work at home, another approved activity within the
local travel area or at the contractor's facility in cases of unforeseen conditions or contingencies (e.g., pandemic conditions, exercises,
etc.).  Any equipment such as laptops or phones provided to Contractor personnel shall be returned at the termination of the engagement or at
another time mutually agreeable to both parties.  Contracting Officer Representative (COR)/Task Monitor (TM) approval is required.  Contractor
shall prepare all deliverables and other contract documentation utilizing contractor resources.  To the extent possible, the contractor shall
use best efforts to provide the same level of support as stated in the SOW/PWS.  In the event the services are impacted, reduced, compromised,
etc., the Contracting Officer or the contractor may request an equitable adjustment.

10.  Period of Performance.  The period of performance is a one-year base period with four (4) one-year options to renew at the Government’s
choosing.  The estimated start date is 15 April 2011.

BASE YEAR:  15 APRIL 2011 – 14 APRIL 2012
OPTION YEAR ONE: 15 APRIL 2012 – 14 APRIL 2013
OPTION YEAR TWO:  15 APRIL 2013 – 14 APRIL 2014
OPTION YEAR THREE:  15 APRIL 2014 –14 APRIL 2015
OPTION YEAR FOUR:  15 APRIL 2015 –14 APRIL 2016

The contract type is firm fixed price (FFP) with a cost-reimbursable contract line item number (CLIN) for contractor travel.

The contractor is expected to be at 100 percent performance on the first day of the performance period.  As directed by the TM/COR, the
contractor shall continue performance in emergency or mission essential conditions.  Additionally, the contractor may be required to account for
the whereabouts of their personnel should this information be requested by the TM/COR.

Generally, this technical support shall be performed Monday through Friday excluding all Federal holidays with core hours of 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.
Normal duty hours are 8 hours per day, not including vacation, sick, holiday and TDY time.  Weekend and off-shift work may also be required as
directed by the government.  No additional financial compensation will be made for work performed outside of day-shift hours.

In the event that upgrades or changes to the system must be done during off peak or limited usage time (i.e. weekends), the Government reserves
the right to request flexible work hours from contractor personnel. Upon a 24 hour advance, written notification from the COR/TM or TAO, the
Government and contractor may establish a mutually agreed upon time to institute/incorporate the system change. Contractor personnel will
substitute the noncore, weekend hours for an equal number of weekday hours. For example, if an upgrade is accomplished on a Saturday and takes 4
hours, contractor personnel may choose to take off 4 hours on the following Monday or Tuesday.

Any work in excess of 40 hours per week must be approved by the COR/TM or TAO prior to performance and will be performed at the straight labor
rate.  The contractor must provide the government TM or TAO with a means of 24 hour communications/contact with contractor personnel.

When the Government installation grants administrative leave to its employees (e.g. as a result of inclement weather, potentially hazardous
condition, or other special circumstances), Contractor personnel working on-site may also be dismissed. However, the Contractor shall not
invoice for these absences.  If directed by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the Contractor shall provide sufficient on-
site personnel to complete or continue critical work already in process or provide on-call response in accordance with the Performance Work
Statement.

Facility Security Clearance.  The work to be performed under this contract is up to and including the Top Secret level and positions are IT-I
for systems access. Therefore the company must have a final or interim Top Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) from the Defense Industrial Security
Clearance Office (DISCO).

Security Clearance and Information Technology (IT) Level.   All personnel performing on this contract will be U.S. citizens.  Contract employees
require a minimum of interim Secret security clearance and interim IT-I eligibility when performance starts.

Investigation Requirements.  Personnel performing duties under this contract must undergo a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background
Investigation (SSBI) as a minimum investigation. The SSBI will be maintained current within 5-years and requests for Special Background Periodic
Review (SBPR)/Phased Periodic Reinvestigation (PPR) will be initiated by DISA 6-months prior to the 5-year anniversary date of the previous
SSBI, SBPR or PPR.

Adjudication for IT Access.  Adjudication of investigations for granting of interim or final IT-I access will be accomplished through DISA
Personnel Security. An exception to this is that individual contractor employees with an SSBI or SBPR (within a 5-year scope) that is already
favorably adjudicated for a Top Secret or Secret security clearance by any of the Department of Defense adjudication facilities (DISCO, DIA,
ACCF, AFCAF, DONCAF, WHSCAF) or other approved adjudication facilities will automatically be accepted for final IT-I access.

Interim IT Access.  Pending completion of an SSBI and final adjudication for security clearance, contractor employees may be granted interim
authorization to perform duties designated as IT-I. The interim authority for IT sensitive positions is the DISA Personnel Security Office.
Following are the requirements, which must be met prior to granting of interim IT-I authorization:

Visit Authorization Letters/Requests.  The Contractor Facility Security Officer (FSO) will forward a Visit Authorization Letter/Request
(VAL/VAR) to the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR)/Task Monitor identified in the Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement
(PWS) for all employees prior to the beginning of each contracting/task order period of performance and as new contractor employees are assigned
to the contract.

The VAL/VAR should be sent via one of two methods. The preferred method is to e-mail the VAL/VAR to the COR. Because it contains sensitive
information covered by the Privacy Act, the VAL/VAR should be sent using in a locked “Zip” file in one e-mail and then followed-up by another e-
mail with the password to unlock the Zipped file. The alternative method to transmit the VAL/VAR is via facsimile (Fax) to the COR. Prior
coordination with the COR should be made via phone to ensure the method of transmission is agreed upon and properly secure.

The VAL/VAR shall be on company letterhead or pre-fabricated form and contain the following information:

Contract number with start and end dates (period of performance)
Government Task Monitor name and telephone number
Complete legal name of employee(s)
Social Security Number (Full SSN required)
Citizenship of the individual
Date and place of birth (state)
Individual’s security clearance level, date granted, adjudication facility name, e.g. DISCO
Type of personnel security investigation (PSI) pending or completed e.g. ANACI, SSBI
Date PSI closed/completed
Individual’s e-mail address
FCL and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code
Name, title, phone, fax number and signature of cognizant official who certifies the authenticity of the individual/facility clearance data
found on the VAR/VAL.  The certifying official may NOT be anyone listed on the VAR/VAL.

The COR will forward the VAR/VAL to DISA-OKC Field Security Office (FSO) or to the appropriate DISA Security Manager or VAR Center for review
and verification.  Once verified, DISA-OKC FSO or the appropriate DISA Security Manager will notify the DISA Personnel Security office if an
investigation is needed.

SSBI Requests. The request for SSBI, thru e-QIP, must be submitted by DISA Personnel Security to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The
contracting company WILL NOT submit contractors for Secret IT-I contracts.  The e-QIP will be initiated and reviewed by DISA Personnel Security
and approved for Interim access if the contractor has a previously favorable NAC and a favorably reviewed SSBI e-QIP. If the contractor DOES NOT
have a previously favorable NAC the e-QIP will be reviewed, if there are issues on the case the process will stop and the contracting company
will supply a new contractor to fill the position. If the case has no issues it will be submitted to OPM. Once the NAC portion closes FAVORABLY,
an Interim IT-I will be granted. This process takes approximately 2-4 weeks once submitted to OPM. If at any time there are issues on the NAC
portion of the SSBI, the investigation will be cancelled and a new contractor will be supplied by the company.

For contractors that are submitting SBPR’s or SSBI’s that have a previously favorable NAC and have a new issue reflected on the e-QIP that is
submitted to DISA, each case will be reviewed and approved or found ineligible by DISA Personnel Security on a case by case basis.

New Contractor Employees.  All new contractor employees are not cleared to report for work until they are cleared through DISA-OKC Security
Office (FSO) or the appropriate DECC Security Manager.

|accomplish assigned missions, as well as proprietary data and information received from or through privileged sources.  Data of this type requires special      |
|handling and protection; dissemination must be limited.  I understand and accept that by being granted access to sensitive data, special confidence and trust   |
|has been placed in me by the United States Government; failure to protect this data would constitute a breach of trust.                                         |
|                                                                                                                                                                |
|2.  I have been given access to sensitive data to facilitate the performance of duties assigned to me for compensation.  It is my responsibility to safeguard   |
|sensitive data disclosed to me, and to refrain from disclosing sensitive data to persons not requiring access for performance of official duties.  Before       |
|disclosing sensitive data, I must determine the recipient's “need to know” or “need to access” sensitive data.  I will first seek guidance from my supervisor;  |
|then from either the appropriate DISA contracting officer (if I am a contractor) or DISA’s Office of the General Counsel (if I am a DISA employee) prior to     |
|disclosing or releasing what may be sensitive data.                                                                                                             |

|3.  Any breach of this Agreement may result in the termination of my access to sensitive data.  Unauthorized release or mishandling of sensitive data may be    |
|grounds for adverse action against me, including termination of my employment.  In addition, unauthorized disclosure of data protected by the Privacy Act may   |
|constitute a violation, or violations, of United States criminal law, and Federally-affiliated workers (including some contract employees) may be disciplined   |
|and fined up to $5,000.00.                                                                                                                                      |
|                                                                                                                                                                |
|4.  All sensitive data that I access remains under the control of the United States Government.  I will return all sensitive data in my possession or for which |
|I am responsible:  a) upon demand by an authorized representative of the United States Government, b) upon the conclusion of my work under this contract, or c) |
|should my work no longer require access to sensitive data.  The conditions and obligations of this Agreement shall continue to apply after my access to         |
|sensitive data has been terminated.                                                                                                                             |

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

   *For Option Year 1, in addition to the minimum 700,000 email accounts, an additional 700,000 email accounts will be added at the beginning of
   Month 9.  This additional 700,000 email accounts is included in the quantities for email support in Option Years 2, 3, and 4.


   Throughout the lifecycle of the requirement, support for an estimated 3.1 million additional Email accounts and 70,000 additional Blackberry
   devices may be added.  (Reference Section 7 of the SOW, Identification of Possible Significant Growth).  This potential additional work is
   dependent on changing requirements and the availability of funding.  The specific requirements for each year cannot be stated with certainty
   at this time and may vary from the numbers identified below.  For that reason the projected growth has been evenly divided in Options Years 1-
   4, with 90% at the OKC location and 10% at the STL location.


   In order to account for this possible growth, offerors are requested  to propose a fixed price for additional Email accounts and Blackberry
   devices in Option Years 1-4 in the amounts identified in the chart below.  These prices will be included in the price evaluation for purposes
   of the award decision and will be used to price growth as additional Email and Blackberry service is added throughout the term of the
   contract.  Any increments above or below these amounts will be prorated accordingly when additional service is ordered.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
GENERAL:  A board of qualified personnel shall evaluate each proposal submitted in response to this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The evaluation
of technical features includes an assessment to determine if the proposed solution satisfies the Government’s objectives and provides for high
quality performance.  The evaluation factors described below will be used to evaluate vendor proposals.

Non-Cost Factors:
Factor 1 - Technical/Management Approach
Factor 2 - Past Performance

Cost/Price Factors:
Factor 3 – Cost/Price

Technical/Management Approach is more important than Past Performance.

All non-cost evaluation factors, when combined, are approximately equal to the Cost/Price factor.

Factor 1 – Technical/Management Approach: The following are the subfactors for Technical/Management Approach.  All subfactors are equal in
importance.

a. The Contractor demonstrates a complete understanding of all technical requirements outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW), and demonstrates
a plan to fully meet or exceed the following tasks from the SOW: Tasks 1 through 13.  The contractor's proposal provides the optimum mix of
labor categories, labor hours, and other direct costs to meet the requirements of the SOW.

b. The contractor demonstrates a comprehensive management approach that ensures fully-trained, top-quality personnel are provided to meet all
requirements of the SOW.  The contractor's management approach addresses how the contractor will track and manage all resources to support the
efforts outlined in the SOW.

Factor 2 - Past Performance:  The government will evaluate the offeror’s recent and relevant experience performing contracts similar in size,
scope and complexity to the tasks outlined in the SOW, as well as their ability to stay on schedule and within contract cost/price.  Recent
contracts are defined as those contracts presently being performed or which have been performed during the past two years from the date of
issuance of this solicitation.  Past Performance relevancy definitions are located below.

Factor 3 - Cost/Price:  The government will evaluate the price proposal offered by the company for the base period and four one-year option
periods, to include the prices proposed for the estimated additional work.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the proposed
cost/price elements are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the
approach described in the vendor’s technical proposal.

The total proposed price for each offeror will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness, and if necessary, price realism.  Cost/Price will
not be rated with a color.

 • Completeness: The Government will verify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs are
   presented in a clear and useful format.

 • Reasonableness:  The Government will determine the reasonableness of the overall price based on adequate price competition and by comparison
   with the Government's Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).

 • Realism: The Government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis to determine whether an offeror's proposed prices are realistic
   for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and are consistent with the various elements of the technical
   proposal.

Note: At the time of award, funds will only be obligated for the base period.

Evaluation of Proposals:

Color Ratings.  A color rating depicts how well the offeror’s proposal meets the evaluation standards and RFQ requirements.  The non-cost
factors will receive color ratings, Cost/Price will not.  Proposals will be rated on the basis of the following color code and risk system:

***** Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an offeror's present and past work
record to assess the Government's confidence in the offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed.  The Government will evaluate
the offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user's needs, including cost and schedule.
 Higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is
