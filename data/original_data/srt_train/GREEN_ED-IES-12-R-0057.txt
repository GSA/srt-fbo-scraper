Who will be the Contract Officer Representative (COR) for this contract? How will costs be considered in the scoring of proposals?

BOTH BOTH

Matthew Soldner will be the COTR on the PEAR contract. Ted Socha will be the COTR on the PEDSS contract. Technical and cost proposals will be separately evaluated. Source selection will be determined by which offeror provides best value to the government. A Tradeoff Source Selection process will be conducted. The Evaluation will include: 1. Technical, 2. Past Performance, 3. Extent of Participation of Small Business Concerns, 4. Cost Realism and Reasonableness. Answer: CAM - Yes. We will post it in a timely manner. So just please continue to look on FedBizOpps for updates and postings. Answer: CAM - No, not a portion. You have to take that responsibility, that subcontractor -- let's say, for instance, you can only do a portion, what I encourage you to do is to team with somebody, to partner, find you some subcontractors, some consultants who have that base. Answer: CAM - I'm Helen Chang. I'm in the contracts office, and I'm a small business liaison. Part 19 in FAR describes all the socioeconomic programs, both that have been passed by law and how we're implementing them as contractors. Part 19 says if a contracting officer has expectation that two or more small businesses can do a procurement, they must set it aside for small business. So the rules on small business on found in Part 19, and our contracting officer, Deila, believes that two or more can do the PEDSS, and therefore she has made an initial decision to set it aside, and will at this point in time only be honoring proposals from a small business. The solicitation release is TBD. Answered: CAM - Right. And also on the pre-solicitation announcement that you received, there was a NAICS Code that was associated with each procurement. So based on that, your company may be a small business based on that NAICS Code, or it may not be, so make sure you look at the announcement again.

Will the a list of the participants in the Pre-Solicitation Conference be made available? When will it be available? If there are components of the proposal (PEAR or PEDSS) that vendor wants to bid, but not the whole is that acceptable?

When will the contract be expected to be awarded? Is it going to be before the end of this year? I think I heard that there is an existing contract that's being split into two separate contracts, so I was just curious as to rationale behind that. Who is the incumbent on the existing contract? Is the Postsecondary Education Analysis Resources (PEAR) a new effort or is there an incumbent?

BOTH BOTH

Answer: CAM - We expect the contract award prior to September 30th. Answer: Determination by CAM to encourage small business participation. Answer: CAM - The current contract is held by MPR Associates. There is an incumbent. The prior contract's notice of award can be found on FBO.GOV at https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ED/OCFO/CPO/ED-07-R0048/listing.html There is substantial variability in the length of Web Tables. Based on the last ten published Web Tables, the average is 100 pages of tables (including their matching standard errors). NCES anticipates a slate of questions that can be addressed via 4 Web Tables, 4 Statistics/Trends in Brief, and no more than 2 SARs.

BOTH PEAR

p. 3 Description of the Web Tables format indicates that analyses in this format range from 10 to 300 pages of tables in length. Can NCES provide an expected average number of pages of tables for this type of reporting format? p. 4 After the contractor prepares an Analysis Prospectus for each research question identified by NCES, NCES may elect to fund the authoring of a draft manuscript on the basis of its acceptance of a particular analysis prospectus. NCES anticipates funding approximately 10 analyses each year, no more than 2 of which are expected to be Statistical Analysis Reports. The remaining 8 analyses are expected to be produced in a Web Table or Statistics or Trends in Brief format. Per the delivery specifications, the prospectuses we prepare will identify the reporting format we propose using, as well as how we will address the question. Should we assume 4 analyses in Web Table format and 4 in Statistics or rends in Brief format, or does that depend on NCES choice of the analyses we propose. p. 5 NCES anticipates that many analyses will employ new derived variables and that NCES will generally elect to post such variables to its PowerStats tool. Can NCES provide an estimate of the average number of new variables it expects per analysis?

PEAR

PEAR

NCES anticipates no more than five new variables per analysis.

p. 6 Professional judgment. The quality control section of task 2 indicates that requested changes of the Professional Judgment type cannot be anticipated by either the contractor or government. Can NCES provide an estimate of the annual level of effort that may be associated with such changes?

PEAR

pp. 7-8 Publication production. Task 3 requires the contractor to provide editing, page layout and formatting, and electronic publishing services. Based on the statement that "All content will be authored by PACE or its agents, not the publication production contractor," it is not clear whether these services apply to the 10 analyses performed each year by the contractor or to other PACE publications. Please clarify the nature of these publications and the number expected. In addition, three levels of work are described for editing (3.1) and page layout and formatting (3.2), and two levels of work are described for electronic publishing services. Should we assume an equal distribution of each level among these publications?

PEAR

NCES can provide an estimate per product in analyst labor hours, based on projects' average complexity. For a Web Table, NCES anticipates one professional judgment review at no more than 8 hours of analyst time. For a Statistics in Brief or Trends in Brief, NCES anticipates two professional judgment reviews at no more than 16 hours of analyst time per review. For a Statistical Analysis Report, NCES anticipates two professional judgment reviews at no more than 32 hours of analyst time per review. The PWS should likely be edited to say "not necessarily the publication production contractor." It is possible that separate firms (e.g., a prime contractor and its subcontractor) might execute Tasks 2 and 3, hence the existing language. All publications from Task 2 NCES wishes to make available to the public will be produced via Task 3. However, it is possible additional materials NOT authored under Task 2 will also be produced under Task 3. Work under Task 3 should not be assumed to be equally distributed by level. Level A editing is envisioned to constitute 70% of Task 3.1, with 15% each of Level B and Level C. Level A page layout is envisioned to constitute 70% of Task 3.2, with 15% each of Level B and Level C. Task 3.3, electronic publishing, will be restructured in the final PWS to provide additional clarity to offerors. We anticipate 5 in-person trainings over the course of the contract. At least 2 national conferences, 2 regional conference, and 1 local conference.

p. 13 Training. The work statement indicates that training will include in-person trainings, webinars, web tutorials, and teleconferences. We understand the in-person trainings to be training conducted at the five national, local, or regional meetings specified in task 6. Can NCES provide an estimate of the number of each other type of training expected? p. 13 Technical support provided during training. On average, how many technical support instances does NCES anticipate will be required at each type of training? p. 15 Review of data files: The work statement indicates that review of data files "can vary from a complete and comprehensive review of data files to the review of a few variables." Can NCES provide an example of what a "complete and comprehensive review" might encompass?

PEAR

PEAR

We anticipate at least two incidents of technical assistance per year. A comprehensive review entails examining all the variables on the data file for the following: reasonableness, accuracy, logic, clarity/completeness of variable descriptions and value labels for clarity and completeness, etc.

What is the anticipated COR review time for the Ad Hoc Analysis statement? Can micro data be accessed by the contractor and approved contractor staff remotely or will all micro data need to be accessed within specified locations? What is the government's estimated level of effort for this contract (in dollars or in person hours)? Will the evaluation of proposals include additional evaluation points for including small businesses as subcontractors? Could NCES please describe what types of information should be included in the corporate capability statement requested? Could NCES please also confirm that the due date for corporate capability statements is indeed, Wednesday, May 9, 2012. If this date is correct, would NCES please consider extending the due from May 9, 2012 to May 11, 2012 in order to ensure a comprehensive response? Please advise as to whether you are able to grant such an extension. 1. The pre-solicitation notice states that: "The government anticipates awarding a fixed price contract or a fixed-price levelof-effort contract." Is there an anticipated budget range/ceiling for this project? 2. Related to the first question, the pre-solicitation notice states that: "The period of performance is a 24 month base period, with three 12-month option periods." Should our initial work plan and budget in the proposal reflect the 24 month base period or the potential full five years?

In general, NCES estimates that the COR can review one analysis prospectus every two business days. Contractors will be expected to acquire restricted-use licenses for access to micro-level data. A link to the NCES Restricted Use manual is contained in the PWS. The final PWS will include the anticipated LOE for each task in PEAR. Yes, the evaluation of proposals will include additional evaluation points for including small businesses as subcontractors. See Instructions to Offerors in the final PWS. Your technical proposal should include a statement of Related Corporate Experience, as described in Instructions to Offerors in the final PWS. No longer applicable.

4. To what extent does our plan for the individual tasks need to reflect coordination with the PEDSS contract? Is there an expectation that roles and procedures for managing the relationship between the PEAR and PEDSS contracts be articulated in the proposal for PEAR? 5. Will NCES specify certain educational credentials and previous experience on NCES project work as criteria for evaluating the offeror?

PEAR

NCES expects the technical and cost proposal for PEAR will reflect the offeror's anticipation of the ways in which there will be overlap between PEAR and PEDSS, and associated costs.

Given the number of information request that can occur on a weekly or a monthly basis under the PEAR contract, I am wondering if there will be priorities for doing those analyses. For example, will a student's set of question for analyses, because they were the first request, take precedence over, for example, questions from university researchers or? How will we set priority among user requests because they come from a variety of sources?

PEAR

13

Is there an expectation that the contractor will deal directly with reporters on information requests or what will the process be?

PEAR

17

You mentioned market research will be done to determine the [contract] vehicle for PEAR. What is meant by that?

PEAR

As noted in the Technical Proposal Evaluation Criteria, the educational credentials of key staff and their experience with postsecondary data (although not necessarily data from NCES) will be evaluated. Additionally, NCES will identify minimum educational credentials for a subset of key personnel in the final PWS. In general, NCES anticipates that request will be handled on a first-come, first-serve basis, except for in high priority requests as determined by NCES and in the best judgment of the contractor's help desk task leader. NCES and the contractor shall establish procedures for prioritizing the requests from the various users. The contractor shall immediately notify the NCES project officer or COR of requests from media, associations/higher education organizations, and government entities; these requests would receive higher priority and require review by NCES staff. We do expect the contractor to have direct contact with reporters. The contractor shall immediately notify the NCES project officer or COR of requests from media, associations/higher education organizations, and government entities; these requests would receive higher priority and require review by NCES staff. Answer: CAM - Well, all of this is market research, marketing communications, asking for your questions and your comments on the statement of work, you all being here today seeing who's in the field, who does this particular type of work. This is all part of acquisition planning. So that's what we're doing right now.

We seem to be in a new era of data management, and with Obama's big data initiative, getting this data out to the public and the end consumer. Could you talk just a little bit about getting new ideas on public outreach? What are your biggest challenges or your biggest user community, and if you have any plans to socialize the statistics in a way that goes beyond the current website? If you had just a few minutes to talk right now, that would be great, just if there is anything current. Are most request for support related to 1) tools, 2) data, 3) analysis methods. Depending on the contract vehicle that you end up deciding will be used for the PEAR, might there be a statement of capabilities that we would be requested to respond to?

NCES is always open to hearing about new ways to expand public outreach. Our biggest helping users to understand our data sets, specifically the uses and limitations of our datasets and numerous variables. We currently have plans to make comparing estimates across datasets much easier.

Is the decision then for PEAR to be an open competition or something other than a small business set-aside?

PEAR

How are users providing feedback? Has there been a user study conducted recently?

PEDSS

What are the biggest user complaints about the system? Biggest challenges?

PEDSS

We anticipate that the majority of requests relate to providing data estimates, followed by data tools, and then analysis methods. Answer: CAM - We asked for corporate capabilities this time, so we'll be using that. I mean, if we decide to go requesting any more further information, preliminary information, we'll ask for that, but that was the whole point, because a lot of times what we do, if you notice, many of you who have done business with the Department of Education and have seen our postings, a lot of times we just ask for the request for information, and a lot of times we don't hold a lot of pre-solicitation conferences, but part of our communication plan is more collaboration and more outreach with the public. So we're just trying to marry all of these together and get as much information as we can. So we do have each company's corporate capability statement, and we're looking at that. So, again, be on the lookout on FedBizOpps if there is any other information requested. Answer: CAM- Okay, as of now, we have not determined that to be a small business set-aside, but as you know, with market research, depending on what that turns up at that particular time, the contracting officer will make the determination if it's a small business set-aside, but as of now, it is open. Users provide feedback to a dedicated Department of Education email account that is monitored in-house. Any inquiry that requires assistance from the PEDSS contractor shall be escalated by the PEDSS COR. Note, these escalations do not involve direct contractor-to-user communication, only NCES-tocontractor. The biggest user concerns are related to unavailability of the system(s) or applications within the systems.

2) The draft PWS for this requirement cites 10 task areas for the fulfillment of a future contract: management of the online analysis and reporting of data and IT support services for Powerstats, Quickstats, Tables Library, Tables Library, WebVTS, Backup, Quality Assurance, Publication of Data Structure and Documentation. What will be the level of effort (LOE) for this requirement? Due to the nature of this requirement, do you envision the labor categories needed for this requirement as including Data Analyst, Data Modeler, Database Administrator, Data Management Specialist, Backup/Recovery Specialist, Information Assurance/Security Specialist, Business Analyst, Document Management Specialist, Technical Writer, Testing Specialist, Validation Analyst and Verification Analyst? If so, in what number for each job title? If so, what would be the appropriate level of educational, training and experience qualifications for each labor category for this requirement? 3) This requirement is very software-specific. How much exposure and experience does the Education Department require its future external contract employees to have for such applications or programs as Powerstats, Quickstats, Tables Library or WebVTS? 4) Because of the call for deliverables throughout the draft PWS, will you require a contractor to recruit a Project Manager and possibly a Program Manager among key personnel for this requirement? In fact, what labor categories will you consider as key personnel? 5) Outside of the realm of IT for this requirement, do you see the need for a recruitment for a Statistician or one familiar with this field of study? 6) Might it be possible to render this as a requirement for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses? 7) What would be the place of performance for this contract?

Will there be overtime? If so, how much funding does the Education Department believe a contractor should devote in his or her budget for overtime? 10) To gain a clear and thorough understanding of the division of labor for this requirement and for the purpose of realistic and reasonable pricing for this requirement, which labor categories will the Education Department deem most applicable for 1,920 or 2,080 contractual man-hours, travel and overtime and for which base periods or option years? 11) What will be required in the way of a technical response for this requirement in the future? Typically, the elements of a technical response suite are technical or management capability, past performance and price. Which of the three will the Education Department prioritize in its bid selection evaluation process for this requirement?

Question # (questions in transcript only) Question Contract Answer

What is the underlying technology (ies) in the PEDSS? Are there any proprietary tools used? Where does the data reside for PEDSS? Is hosting the production data performed by PEDSS contractor? Who is responsible for data validation of the datasets submitted by contractors in WebVTS?

PEDSS PEDSS

PEDSS

Were the tools developed using 2rd party/COTS tools or custom developed If custom-built, which platform is it developed on and which programming language used? 1 WebVTS, whether this is a backend tool that has web interface, so this is more like an admin tool for the people to use. That's my question, whether that is true or not. When the data comes to the VTS, brought over to the VTS, in what format does it come from RTI in the contract? Does the data that comes to the VTS go through a QC process? Does it go through a QC, a new QC process, or the contractor of the one VTS has to do that? Who's got to do the QC from the time it comes from the collection contractor to the time that it is in the VTS? What level of tech support? M-F, 8-5 or 24x7 What is the current staffing and budget?

PEDSS PEDSS

All existing tools have been custom-developed (non-proprietary) using SQL, .NET, and ASP languages. The data is located on the Contractor's servers for testing and back-up purposes only. Both the data and the "live" tools that access it will be located at the Department of Education. The PEDSS contract supports a minimum level of QC support for WebVTS-supplied data. Unless otherwise instructed by the COTR, the PEDSS contractor is only responsible QC-ing up to the point of successful completion of Subtask 6.3. Custom-developed. Developed on: HP Proliant servers running Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition. Programming languages: SQL, .NET, and ASP. WebVTS is a admin tool that will have around 50 active NCES or NCES data collection contractor users. It will come over in either delimited format or in a PEDSScontractor-specified Excel file format. The PEDSS contract supports a minimum level of QC support for WebVTS-supplied data. Unless otherwise instructed by the COTR, the PEDSS contractor is only responsible QC-ing up to the point of successful completion of Subtask 6.3. It is expected that the Contractor be available for COTR tech support from 12:00 to 16:00, Mon thru Fri EDT/EST. Answer: CAM - Whenever the solicitation is released, at that particular time, there may be level of effort provided to give you an idea of estimated hours. Also, based on this particular PreSolicitation Conference, there may actually be some changes to the draft Performance Work Statement, so some of these things may be clarified within that. So hopefully during the solicitation process, you might get some answers to that...But at this particular point in time, we don't have that particular information on hand.

Will the software development work be done at the contractor's site or government site Is hosting of the website/portal part of the PEDSS contract? It doesn't appear that it would be, but if not, could you please describe the interaction between the vendor that's responsible for hosting of actual portal and website and the PEDSS contract.

PowerStats and then QuickStats, what tools are they viewed on? Is that like they're viewed on a third-party tool or is that a custom-view tools? And if it's custom-view tool, which platform that was viewed on and which languages you ed, which proven languages you use to view on? So the second question is that before the data get published, it's actually put on a reviewer's server. So the reviewer's server, I suppose, is going to be provided by the PEAR's contractor. That's my assumption. Now, what about PEDSS contractor? Will the PEDSS contractor also provide a reviewer's server in addition to the development server? So the data is going to be pushed from the reviewer's server to the development server. So I suppose that the PEDSS contractor will just take care of the development server, not the reviewer's server. So please clarify. And the third one is the PEDSS contract talk about backup of data. So where the data will be backed up to? Will that be backed up to a server provided by the Department of Education or it's going to be provided by the contractor?

PEDSS

Users provide feedback to a dedicated Department of Education email account that is monitored in-house. Any inquiry that requires assistance from the PEDSS contractor shall be escalated by the PEDSS COR. Note, these escalations do not involve direct contractor-to-user communication, only NCES-tocontractor.

The DataLab talk about it's a suite of tools, but you also mention that the Tables Library is also part of the DataLab. But my understanding is that the Tables Library is not a tool, it's data, right? So it is not part of the DataLab. Or maybe it's just a data tier for the DataLab. For the PEDSS training, who are users trained, how any users trained, location(s) of training. For PEDSS, is all new development enhancements to current apps or could new tech be considered? You mentioned that the PEDSS was a small business set-aside? That decision has been made, right? Which level of NIST security?

PEDSS

Answer: Ted - So the DataLab is just a term that we use that incorporates all of our publicly facing tools...So Tables Library, yes, it's a look-up database. And it doesn't perform any additional functions than what's already programmed in. PEDSS Contractor-provided training is listed only as an option. No specifications have been made. Task 5 -- TrendStats is new. The rest will be considered enhancements. Answer: CAM - Yes Answer: CAM - Yes Moderate.

I. I.A.

INTRODUCTION Purpose of Project

The United States Department of Education's (ED) National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Science (IES) has a requirement to publish via the Web reports and data tables on postsecondary education topics. These reports and tables will draw on several large and complex data collections including: national longitudinal surveys; linked cross-sectional surveys; census data; and administrative record data. In addition, NCES has a requirement for expert technical support in the development, management, and analysis of these data, and for the expert user assistance and training in support of researchers and the public who work with these data. The contractor shall conduct data analyses, produce reports, edit documents prepared by the government, and prepare graphic materials. It shall provide expert technical assistance to NCES in data quality assurance and analysis, and support to data users, including both training, focused assistance with data tools and studies they support. The period of performance is 24 months, with three option periods exercised annually as needed. The work will be monitored by NCES and this requirement will be referred to hereafter as the Postsecondary Education Analysis Resources (PEAR). Meeting these requirements requires close and continuing collaboration with a parallel contract--Postsecondary Education Data Structure Support (PEDSS; ED-IES-12-R-0056)--that supports a data library and a data analysis system that facilitate access to reports, tables, and data. PEAR and PEDSS are successor contracts to Postsecondary Education Descriptive Analysis Reports. More information about this contract can be found on the FedBizOpps website, at: https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ED/OCFO/CPO/ED-07-R-0048/listing.html

I.B.

Current Status

NCES currently produces reports, data analysis tools, and a data library to support and encourage the use of its postsecondary data collections. Current versions of the data library and data analysis tools are displayed at http://nces.ed.gov/datalab. Example of web-based tables and reports can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas/ and its related studies.

SCOPE OF WORK

PEAR consists of seven tasks, as follows: 1. Management- Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) 2. Analysis and Reporting- Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) with 3. Publication Production- Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) with Firm-Fixed-Price Level- Of-Effort (FPP-LOE) tasks 4. Ad Hoc Analysis- Firm-Fixed-Price Level- Of-Effort (FPP-LOE)

PEAR Attachment A Page 2 of 28 5. Data User Support Service- Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) 6. Training and Conference Presentations- Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) 7. Quality Assurance- Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) The contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, services, and facilities necessary to perform the requirements as described below. (Note: the government may provide unedited/untypeset documents for work described under Task 3, Publication Production.) TASK 1. MANAGEMENT The contractor shall manage the analysis and reporting of data in a manner that establishes quality control at all levels and fosters communications between the contractor's staff, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and potential users of the data. This task continues for the entire contract period. Task 1 includes the following requirements: Subtask 1.1 Post-Award Kick-Off Meeting

Within the first week after contract award, the contractor's project director and other key project staff shall hold a meeting at NCES with the COR and other appropriate NCES staff to review the overall contract tasks. The primary purpose of this meeting is to refine the management, staffing, and scheduling plans. These refinements are not to modify or alter the specifications of the contract, but to provide management information for use by both the contractor and the Government in monitoring the work to be performed. This conference is also to help the contractor to make use of the experience and materials that NCES staff members have gained over the years. Subtask 1.2 Monthly Progress Reports

The contractor shall report monthly on the progress made in accomplishing the project tasks, problems encountered, and plans for the next month. The contractor shall attach an updated schedule of deliverables, a financial statement showing consumption of funds, and a staffing plan showing monthly, contract year-to-date, and contract-to-date labor usage to each monthly report. Deliverables: Subtask 1.2.1 Monthly progress reports (1.2) Schedules

The contractor shall develop and maintain a detailed schedule for all activities of the project. The schedule shall be updated monthly and attached to the monthly progress report (subtask 1.2) Subtask 1.2.2 Financial Statements

The contractor shall develop and maintain a detailed financial statement for all activities of the project, including budgeted and actual costs for each month, contract year-to-date, and contract to date.. The financial statement shall be updated monthly and attached to the monthly progress report (subtask 1.2). Subtask 1.2.3 Staffing Plan

The contractor shall develop and maintain a detailed staffing plan showing monthly, contract year-to-date, and contract-to-date labor usage for all project activities. The staffing plan shall be updated monthly and attached to the monthly progress report (subtask 1.2). Subtask 1.3 Confidentiality Reports

PEAR Attachment A Page 3 of 28 The contractor shall file reports as needed with the NCES COR that identify staff with access to restricted data. Deliverables: Confidentiality documents (1.3)

TASK 2. ANALYSIS AND REPORTING The contractor shall prepare policy-relevant statistical analyses in response to a slate of research questions identified by NCES, targeted for release to the general public. The slate is issued in October of a given year; periodically, NCES may add one or two possible research topics to the slate in response to emergent issues. NCES anticipates the slate will typically consist of 10 questions: 4 questions that can be addressed by Web Tables, 4 questions that can be addressed by Statistics in Brief, and 2 questions that are best addressed by Statistical Analysis Reports. Typically, analyses are based on data collected via studies sponsored by the Postsecondary, Adult, and Career Education Division (PACE) of NCES, although other relevant federal data collections may also be appropriate given the specific research question. Most if not all analyses will require the use of NCES micro-level data at the contractor's facility/work location. Because such data are released only to contractors after approval for a restricted-use data (RUD) license, offerors should review http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/rudman/ to ascertain how joining the RUD program may impact price and/or schedule. Analyses may be addressed using any of the following reporting formats described there: (a) Web Tables, (b) Statistics in Brief, (c) Statistical Analysis Reports. Generally: 1. Web Tables. Web tables are designed to release large amounts of tabular data to the general public. They include approximately 3 pages of front-matter broadly describing the contents of the publication, 10 pages of back-matter providing technical detail as to how the tables were constructed, and between 10 and 300 pages of tables. Based on the last ten published web tables, the average is 100 pages of tabular material. An example of this type of publication, SixYear Attainment, Persistence, Transfer, Retention, and Withdrawal Rates of Students Who Began Postsecondary Education in 2003­04, can be found on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011152). 2. Statistics in Brief. Statistics in Brief are designed to provide a more in-depth discussion of a specific topic. Typically, Statistics in Brief do not exceed 20 pages in length, and contain no more than 12 figures/tables. An example of this type of publication, Military Service Members and Veterans, can be found on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011163). 3. Statistical Analysis Reports. Statistical Analysis Reports provide a thorough treatment of a specific topic or set of related research questions. Typically, Statistical Analysis Reports do not exceed 125 pages in length, containing no more than 30 figures/tables. An example of this type of publication, On Track to Complete, can be found on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009152).

Acceptance or Rejection of Deliverables Under Subtasks 2.1 through 2.4 Deliverables are acceptable to NCES only when their contents: (1) Are prepared in a manner consistent with all "Applicable Documents" described below; (2) Contain all elements described in the subtask; (3) Address the research question approved by the COR; and

PEAR Attachment A Page 4 of 28 (4) When applicable, address all corrective feedback provided by a reviewer (unless the COR specifically directs the contractor to not act upon one or more pieces of such feedback). Final determination of acceptance or rejection will be made by the CO, upon recommendation by the COR. Deliverables that do not meet these standards will be considered to contain errors, and may be rejected by the CO or, at his or her discretion, accepted after all errors are remedied. More information can be found below in Quality Control. Subtask 2.1. Analysis Prospectus For each analysis the contractor performs in response to the NCES slate of topics, the contractor shall prepare a brief prospectus which identifies how the research question posed by NCES is to be addressed. Prospectuses are due to the COR twenty (20) business days after the slate (or any additional research question or questions) has been electronically provided to the contractor by the COR. NCES anticipates it will take approximately two business days to consider each analysis prospectus. NCES will not provide feedback on any submitted analysis prospectus. Acceptance of a prospectus is not a guarantee of future work under this contract. Deliverable: Prospectus. Subtask 2.2. Draft Manuscript NCES may elect to fund the authoring of drafts manuscripts on the basis of any or all accepted analysis prospectuses. At election, NCES will provide the contractor feedback on the analysis prospectus to ensure the resulting draft manuscript meets the needs of NCES and the publication's intended audience. Once received by the COR, draft manuscripts will be reviewed within ten business days and feedback returned to the contractor for corrective action. After receipt, the contractor shall prepare subsequent draft versions for inspection by NCES and will receive additional corrective feedback, if needed. On average, two total rounds of NCES feedback are required before a manuscript is approved by NCES. The contractor has eighty (80) business days after the initial election of funding to produce a final draft manuscript. Deliverable: NCES-approved manuscript ready for Review by NCES Statistical Standards Program (SSP). Subtask 2.3. Review-Quality Manuscript If, after accepting the final draft manuscript, NCES wishes it to proceed to publication, NCES will forward the manuscript to the NCES Statistical Standards Program (SSP) for review. After review, which takes an average of 15 business days, NCES will receive corrective feedback from SSP. Upon NCES receipt of that feedback, it will be forwarded to the contractor for review. After receipt, the contractor shall prepare subsequent draft versions for inspection by SSP and will receive additional corrective feedback, if needed. On average, two total rounds of feedback are required before a manuscript is approved by SSP. The contractor has one-hundred and twenty (120) business days after the initial election of funding to produce a final review-quality manuscript.

PEAR Attachment A Page 5 of 28 Deliverable: SSP-approved manuscript ready for Review by IES Standards and Review Office (SRO). Subtask 2.4. Publication-Ready Manuscript Manuscripts accepted under Subtask 2.3 will be forwarded to SRO for either internal review or review by a jury of outside experts. The results of SRO review will be forwarded to the contractor for corrective action. After review, which takes an average of 30 business days, NCES will receive corrective feedback from SRO. Upon NCES receipt of that feedback, it will be forwarded to the contractor for review. Upon receipt of feedback from SRO, the contractor shall have ten (10) business days to prepare a subsequent version for inspection by SRO and will receive additional corrective feedback, if needed. On average, two total rounds of feedback are required before a manuscript is approved by SRO. Deliverable: SRO-approved manuscript. Subtask 2.5. Response to Professional Judgment Reviews - Firm-Fixed-Price Level- Of-Effort (FPP-LOE) This subtask includes the reanalysis or reworking of a manuscript, incorporating reviewer changes, modifications, and corrections thereto when such changes and modifications are not due to contractor error but instead to corrections motivated by reviewers' professional judgment. Upon receipt of a professional judgment review, the contractor shall advise the COR of an anticipated delivery schedule for the modified review- or publication-quality manuscript. The NCES COR and the contractor will negotiate a date for receipt for a revised deliverable, or the NCES COR will reject the proposed schedule and cease further work on the publication. Deliverable: Modified manuscript, by the negotiated date identified by the NCES COR. Subtask 2.6. Pre-release Quality Control- Firm-Fixed-Price Level- Of-Effort (FPP-LOE) Although some completed analyses may be based entirely on derived variables that have already been made available via NCES's public data tool, PowerStats (http://nces.ed.gov/datalab), NCES anticipates that many analyses will employ new derived variables that, once highlighted in a publication, may be of interest to other researchers. As such, NCES may elect to post variables derived by the contractor to PowerStats. As part of that process, the contractor will be required to collaborate with the IES Information Technology unit, or contractors working with IES or NCES (most notably the contractor associated with the PEDSS contract), to: Subtask 2.6.1. No fewer than forty (40) business days prior to the release of a contractor's first publication requiring the posting of a new variable, develop a quality control procedure, with the advice and approval of NCES; and Deliverable: Description of quality control procedure, to include a standard format for reporting results of quality control testing to NCES to be used for Subtask 2.6.2. Subtask 2.6.2. No fewer than twenty (20) business days prior to the anticipated release of a publication requiring a newly posted variable, verify that new derived variables and their associated values match those to be posted to PowerStats. Deliverable: Statement of results from quality control testing.

Applicable documents The contractor shall use the following the mandatory standards, guides, references, and authorities in the production of all deliverables.. 1. NCES Statistical Standards, available from http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/standards.asp 2. IES Style Guide, available from http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/style.asp 3. IES Graphics Guide, available from http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/styleguide/pdf/graphicsguide.pdf 4. American Psychological Association Publication Manual, 6 edition, see http://www.apastyle.org/manual/index.aspx Quality control NCES employs a rigorous process of review, including internal review for all publications and external review for Statistics in Brief and Statistical Analysis Reports. The review process consists of four steps, outlined below. Each step is associated with a specific subtask. 1. Prospectus development (Subtask 2.1) a. Contractor preparation of draft prospectus, 2. Preparing a draft manuscript (Subtask 2.2) a. Contractor preparation of draft manuscript, based on NCES feedback on prospectus; b. At least two rounds of PACE review of draft with feedback to contractor, and c. Contractor action on feedback and inspection of deliverable. 3. Preparing a review-quality manuscript based upon feedback received from NCES Statistical Standards Program (SSP) review (Subtask 2.3) a. SSP review with feedback to contractor, b. Contractor action on feedback, c. Resubmission to SSP for approval of changes, and d. Inspection of deliverable. 4. Preparing publication-ready manuscript based upon feedback received from Institute for Education Standards (IES) Standards and Review Office (SRO) review (Task 2.4) a. SRO (or SRO and external jury) review with feedback to contractor, b. Contractor action on feedback, c. Resubmission to SRO for approval of changes, and d. Inspection of deliverable. In Tasks 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, two issues may arise under quality control. 1. Errors. Under this task, the COR will monitor and evaluate contractor's performance by examining all deliverables for errors. An error is the presentation of material that is contrary to the guidelines, standards, or other directions provided to the Contractor. (See Acceptance or Rejection of Deliverables Under Subtasks 2.1 through 2.4.) The COR will return to the Contractor any deliverable in which errors are noted; the Contractor shall review the deliverables and correct all errors. Upon re-presentation of the deliverable, the Government shall make subsequent reviews to verify the correction of errors. If additional errors are noted, the correction process shall be repeated until the COR recommends acceptance of the deliverable.
th

PEAR Attachment A Page 7 of 28 2. Professional judgment. In addition to identifying errors, reviewers may raise issues with contractors' work on the basis of professional judgments and preferences. Requested changes of this type are not errors and cannot be anticipated by either the contractor or the government. Issues raised via professional judgment are typically resolved through negotiation between the party raising the concern, NCES, and the author. If a manuscript requires revision in response to the professional judgment of a reviewer, work can be completed under Subtask 2.5. Additional technical requirements Work shall be performed on either the Macintosh or Microsoft's Windows operating systems (OS) platform. Standard word processing and statistical software (e.g., Stata, SAS, SPSS, or R) must be used. Current versions of OS and software should be used. Unless otherwise agreed upon, all deliverables should be submitted via electronic mail to the COR. TASK 3. PUBLICATION PRODUCTION The Contractor shall provide publication production services, including editing, page layout and formatting, electronic publishing, and other quality control services as needed. Under this task, the Postsecondary, Adult, and Career Education Division (PACE) at the National Center for Education Statistics (part of the U. S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Science) will order publication production services. In general, documents and publications covered by this contract shall be prepared for an educated but lay reader in mind, and shall focus on issues related to postsecondary education. The format and style, techniques, and method of presentation shall be consistent with NCES standards, guidelines, styles, practices, and type of production planned. PACE will be relying on the Contractor to edit, prepare, and deliver electronic files for electronic publishing; a limited number of publications may be printed by the Government Printing Office (GPO). All content will be authored by PACE or its agents, not the publication production contractor. Although the content of publications will vary, each publication will fall in to one of three general types: 1. Web Tables. Web tables are designed to release large amounts of tabular data to the general public. They include approximately 3 pages of front-matter broadly describing the contents of the publication, 10 pages of back-matter providing technical detail as to how the tables were constructed, and between 10 and 300 pages of tables. An example of this type of publication, SixYear Attainment, Persistence, Transfer, Retention, and Withdrawal Rates of Students Who Began Postsecondary Education in 2003­04, can be found on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011152). 2. Statistics in Brief. Statistics in Brief are designed to provide a more in-depth discussion of a specific topic. Typically, Statistics in Brief do not exceed 20 pages in length, and contain no more than 12 figures/tables. An example of this type of publication, Military Service Members and Veterans, can be found on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2011163).

3. Statistical Analysis Reports. Statistical Analysis Reports provide a thorough treatment of a specific topic or set of related research questions. Typically, Statistical Analysis Reports do not exceed 125 pages in length, containing no more than 30 figures/tables. An example of this type of publication, On Track to Complete, can be found on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2009152). Subtask 3.1. Editing

Additional technical requirements Work shall be performed on either the Macintosh or Microsoft's Windows operating systems (OS) platform. Standard word processing, professional publishing and graphic applications software must be used. Current versions of OS and software should be used. Unless otherwise agreed upon, all deliverables should be submitted via electronic mail to the COR. Delivery Schedule Materials requiring editing, layout, or electronic publishing will be electronically submitted to the contractor, along with the COR's assessment of the anticipated level of work and the due date for the final deliverable. The contractor shall review each submission within one business day of receipt, unless otherwise negotiated, and provide the COR an estimated delivery date for the final deliverable. The COR will set the date upon which the deliverable is due and inform the contractor, who will either accept the date and commence work or forfeit the work opportunity. TASK 4. AD-HOC ANALYSIS - Firm-Fixed-Price Level- Of-Effort (FPP-LOE) From time to time, NCES requires the execution of ad-hoc analyses based on data collected from postsecondary sample surveys (e.g., the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study), institutional data collections (e.g., the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), or external data sources (e.g., Office of Postsecondary Education's Cohort Default Rates, Federal Student Aid's Gainful Employment datasets, Bureau of Labor Statistics' Current Population Study). These analyses typically answer specific research questions and are for internal use only. Findings are presented in memo form with limited tabular accompaniments. Turnaround time for these analyses is short, ranging from one to five business days. Approximately six (6) such analyses are expected per year. Applicable documents The contractor shall be guided by the following standards in the production of all deliverables. Because these deliverables are not for external consumption, variances from these standards are permitted so long as they are discussed with the COR and presented as caveats in the deliverable itself. 1. NCES Statistical Standards, available from http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/standards.asp. Additional technical requirements and delivery schedule
th

PEAR Attachment A Page 11 of 28 After receipt of an ad-hoc analysis request from NCES, the contractor shall prepare a brief statement, not to exceed one page, of: (1) intended methodology, (2) anticipated date of completion, and (3) key personnel assigned to the task. After approval by the COR, work shall commence. Deliverable. Memo in Microsoft Word format (or equivalent), including supporting raw data files (e.g., SAS or Stata datasets, or Excel workbooks) and syntax, if applicable. TASK 5. DATA USER SUPPORT SERVICE The contractor shall establish a data user support services or process to respond to ad hoc information data requests in a consistent and reliable manner, and on a timely basis. NCES anticipates receiving approximately 80 information requests of varying complexity each month from policy makers, researchers, reporters, and students. Requests range from providing information about our PACE studies to demonstrating how to use our data tools to assisting researchers with the use of the restricted-use data files. NCES and the contractor shall establish procedures for prioritizing the requests from the various users. The contractor shall immediately notify the NCES project officer or COR of requests from media, associations/higher education organizations, and government entities; these requests receive higher priority and require review by NCES staff. Typically, analyses are based on data collected via studies sponsored by the Postsecondary, Adult, and Career Education Division of NCES, although other relevant federal data collections may also be appropriate given the specific research question. Most if not all analyses will require the use of NCES data analysis tools. However, some analyses may require access to micro-level data. Because such data are released only after approval for a restricted-use data (RUD) license, offerors should review http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/rudman/ to ascertain how joining the RUD program may impact price and/or schedule. The contractor shall respond to these requests as well as compile, maintain, analyze, publish, and disseminate the documentation and data used for these requests. This requires the establishment and/or maintenance of systems and procedures to aid in these activities. Subtask 5.1 ­ Maintain the Data User Support Service/system to receive information requests The contractor shall perform the following, but not limited to: ˇ ˇ Maintain telephone number (with voicemail) to receive and respond to requests from the Department's constituents. Maintain an email account to receive and to respond to requests from the public and from other government agencies.

Requests are received on a sporadic basis during the business day (Monday ­ Friday, 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, while the federal government is open), rather than continuously throughout the day. As such, although availability to respond to telephone calls, voicemails, and emails is needed each business day, it is anticipated that this position would require approximately 0.25 FTE staff time per week. Subtask 5.2 ­ Respond to information requests The contractor shall perform the following, but not limited to: ˇ Distribute data to NCES' constituents and respond to requests for information, relying first on published material, and second, on analysis, within 1 to 2 business days. NCES anticipates up to twenty (20) inquiries per week. Format information as tables or graphic presentations according to NCES Style standards. Review and proofread non-published tables or analyses provided.

ˇ ˇ

PEAR Attachment A Page 12 of 28 ˇ ˇ Adhere to all NCES standards on data security and confidentiality requirements. As necessary, obtain and extract data sets and supporting documentation suitable for further analyses and replication of results.

This includes technical clarification about issues related to the sample survey data. Provide assistance to restricted-use data file users in installing and analyzing complex survey data.

ˇ

ˇ

Subtask 5.3 ­ Track information requests, responses, and documentation. The contractor shall perform the following, but not limited to: ˇ Maintain, in an electronic format and on their own systems, a tracking log that records all requests received. The log should include: the type of requestor (i.e., media, government, researcher, general public), a description of the request and the work performed, and numbers of hours spent responding to request. This tracking log should be updated weekly, be accessible by the NCES COR via the Web (e.g., via a Web portal or other remote connection to the contractor's system), and allow the NCES COR to download its contents for review. Maintain, in an electronic format and on their own systems, an archive which documents analyses conducted for customers. The archive should include all tables/estimates and their supporting documentation (e.g., PowerStats XML files or syntax files from statistical software) archives analyses conducted for customers. This database should be updated weekly, be accessible by the NCES COR via the Web (e.g., via a Web portal or other remote connection to the contractor's system), and allow the NCES COR to download its contents for review. Quarterly, provide written feedback on issues/problems or limitations of data sets to the COR to keep us alert to new information needs and more knowledge about the data. This will provide a feedback loop from the user community to the project officers.

TASK 6 ­ TRAINING AND CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONS NCES staff members are often called upon by outside groups (e.g., professional associations, institutions, or other groups of data users) to provide training to analysts. The contractor shall assist NCES staff in conducting training for such data users and in the development of training materials. The contractor shall also providing training at up to five (5) non-ED national, local, or regional meetings (e.g., National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, Association for the Study of Higher Education, American Council on Education, etc.). In addition to covering the use of PACE data tools, these trainings may also include presentations about PACE studies and other related topics. Training includes in-person training, webinars, web tutorials, and teleconferences. Efficiency would be gained by having online tutorials to assist users and meeting training demands for more frequent and regular training sessions. PACE expects that training will include not only formal presentations, but also hands-on activities that will engage participants and that will demonstrate effective practices. The contractor shall develop materials for use at workshops and trainings that will facilitate learning and be of use to audience members after the workshops. The COR shall have final approval for all training and related materials, including any significant edits to previously approved materials. The contractor shall perform the following: Subtask 6.1 ­ Develop and update training or conference materials The contractor shall develop, review, and update training and/or conference materials. These trainings can range from two hours to a full day. These trainings may be held as pre-conference workshops associated with conferences.

Subtask 6.2 ­ Develop webinar or other online training The contractor shall develop up to 10 Web-based training modules for data users. Topics will be identified through consultations between the contractor and the NCES COR, and might include topics such as: information about our studies, how to use our data tools, use of restricted use data files, or technical or statistical issues relevant to using our data. Once topics have been identified, the NCES COR will identify a date by which each module should be complete and ready for delivery to NCES for dissemination. The contractors shall provide the COR a copy of the script/contents of the module two months prior to the completion date for approval.

Subtask 6.3 ­ Provide technical support at trainings

PEAR Attachment A Page 14 of 28 The contractor shall provide technical support at trainings or presentations conducted by NCES staff or the contractor, approximately two (2) times per year. Contractor staff assigned to this task that have experience with NCES data tools and studies.

Subtask 6.4 ­ Provide training and presentations The contractor shall lead training sessions and make presentations at approximately one conference per year. This include preparing material and handouts, collecting feedback on each training, and producing an evaluation report summarizing the training and identifying what worked and areas for improvement. The contractor shall use participant and NCES feedback to revise subsequent training sessions.

Applicable documents As appropriate, the contractor shall reference the NCES Statistical Standards, http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/standards.asp. Deliverables Final presentation and handout used at trainings at least two weeks prior to events. Final webinars and training modules by date due. Written report on support provided at training no more than two weeks following the event. Written training report, including copies of evaluations for completed event, no more than two weeks following the event. TASK 7 ­ QUALITY ASSURANCE The contractor shall provide professional review of tables, reports, data files, and data tools developed by NCES or other entities. These activities range from verifying estimates in tables to helping analyze data in a report. This task not only includes checking estimates, but providing recommendations and guidance on how to improve the table or report and feedback about which variables or additional analyses would be best. The contractor shall develop processes to check these products and update these processes as necessary. The contractor shall also provide feedback on missing variables or additional information that might improve these products. Turnaround for these reviews is short, ranging from one to five business days. NCES expects there to be approximately 20 analyses pertaining to tables and reports, and another 10 analyses pertaining to data files and data tools each year. Specifically, the contractor shall develop quality assurance processes appropriate to the type of product, review the product, provide written comments (including suggestions for improvement), and regularly review feedback provided to determine if general issues are emerging that should be addressed by NCES. Subtask 7.1 ­ Review of tables and reports The contractor shall develop and implement quality assurance procedures on tables and reports. These includes replicating estimates, verifying logic and assumptions, and reviewing text, titles, footnotes, and other features of the tables or reports for accuracy and ease of comprehension.

PEAR Attachment A Page 20 of 28 8. Quality control procedures (Subtask 2.6.1) Analyses approved by SRO will generally be published by NCES. If an analysis relies upon a variable not currently available to the general public (e.g., it is derived by the author from restricted-use data), NCES will typically require that variable be made available on its public-use data tool, PowerStats. This tool is jointly maintained by NCES and the contractor(s) responsible for the Postsecondary Education Data Structure (PEDS) contract. No fewer than forty (40) business days before NCES releases a contractor's first report using a previously unavailable variable, the contractor must develop a quality control procedure that ensures a variable ultimately made available via PowerStats is in every way identical to a variable used in an analysis to be published. The quality control procedure should include: (1) How the new variable is provided to NCES and the PEDS contractor (e.g., as a CSV file containing the new variable value and the appropriate study case ID for linking), (2) Syntax for how the variable was created and other relevant metadata, (3) One or more methods for determining that, for each case in the dataset, the value of the variable created by the analysis contractor matches that found in the dataset underlying the public tool. (This will likely involve collaboration with the PEDS contractor.) (4) A standard reporting template for communicating variable construction syntax, metadata, and testing results to NCES. Delivery specifications: A memo describing the quality control procedure by the contractor shall be delivered electronically to the NCES COR no fewer than forty (40) business days prior to the scheduled release of a contractor's first report. Accompanying the memo should be a copy of the standard reporting template described above. The memo and template should be in Microsoft Office format, or equivalent. 9. Quality control testing reports (Subtask 2.6.2) In the event a forthcoming publication relies upon a previously unreleased variable, that variable must be made available to the public via NCES' public-use data tool, PowerStats (see Subtask 2.6.1). No fewer than twenty (20) business days prior to the publication's release, the analysis contractor should provide results of quality control testing, developed under subtask 2.6.1, to NCES. Delivery specifications: No fewer than twenty (20) business days prior to the release of a publication using a previously unreleased variable, the contractor shall submit the results of their quality control testing using the standard reporting template approved under Subtask 2.6.1. The results shall be delivered electronically to the NCES COR in Microsoft Office format, or equivalent. 10. Editing (Subtask 3.1) Documents submitted to the contractor for editing by NCES shall typically be in a format supported by Microsoft Office (or equivalent). Edited documents should be returned to the NCES COR in the appropriate Microsoft Office format, using "track changes" or equivalent. Level A editing is distinguished from Level B and Level C editing in that Level A work does not anticipate the editor restructuring the material provided. Level B work anticipates restructuring up to one third of government-furnished materials, while Level C work anticipates restructuring up to two-thirds of government-furnished materials. Delivery specifications: Edited materials are due on a date set by the NCES COR, based upon the level of work required, in consultation with the contractor. The contractor shall deliver edited documents to the NCES COR in the appropriate Microsoft Office format, with changes indicated via the "track changes" feature or equivalent. 11. Page layout and formatting (Subtask 3.2)

PEAR Attachment A Page 21 of 28 NCES will submit manuscript (or otherwise unformatted) versions of documents to the contractor for page-layout and formatting, typically in a format supported by Microsoft Office (or equivalent). The contractor shall format the document or documents per applicable standards (described in Subtask 3) and return each in both the native format of the contractor's desktop publishing software and as a PDF. PDFs need not be 508-compliant, as such work is anticipated under Subtask 3.3 Level A layout and formatting is distinguished from Level B and C layout in that Level A formatting is the initial formatting of a source document provided by NCES. Level B and Level C represent modifications to work already formatted in A: Level B work involving up to one-third of the document and Level C work involving up to two-thirds of the document. Delivery specifications: Formatted materials are due on a date set by the NCES COR, based upon the level of work required, in consultation with the contractor. The contractor shall deliver edited documents to the NCES COR in the native format used by the contractor's desktop publishing software and as a PDF. 12. Electronic publishing (Subtask 3.3) NCES will submit formatted or unformatted documents to the contractor for conversion to 508-compliant PDFs, HTML, or SGML, as identified by the COR. Source material may be in Microsoft Office or PDF format, or, if work was already performed under subtask 3.2 the format employed by the contractor's desktop publishing software. Level A publishing involves the creation of documents with links, bookmarks, or other markup structures that comprise less than one-third of the document. Level B publishing involves the creation of documents with links, bookmarks, or other markup structures that comprise one-third or more of the document. Delivery specifications: Materials to be electronically published are due on a date set by the NCES COR, based upon the level of work required, in consultation with the contractor.

DEPARTMENT SECURITY

Compliance with ED IT Security Policy The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall comply with the Department of Education's IT security policy requirements, specifically those set forth in the `Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy (OCIO-01)', and other applicable procedures and guidance. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall develop and implement management, operational and technical security controls to assure required levels of protection for information systems. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall further comply with all applicable Federal IT security requirements including, but not limited to, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 Appendix III, Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards and guidance.

PEAR Attachment A Page 26 of 28 These security requirements include, but are not limited to, the successful Certification and Accreditation (C&A) or Security Authorization (SA) of the system (includes commercially owned and operated systems managed by the commercial vendor and its sub-contractors, supporting Department programs, contracts, and projects); obtaining a full Authority to Operate (ATO) before being granted operational status; performance of annual self-assessments of security controls; annual Contingency Plan testing; performance of periodic vulnerability scans; updating all information system security documentation as changes occur; and other continuous monitoring activities, which may include, mapping, penetration and other intrusive scanning. Full and unfettered access for the Department's third party Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) must be granted to access all computers and networks used for this system. Additionally, when there is a significant change to the system's security posture, the system (Federal and commercial prime- and sub- contractors included) must have a new C&A or SA, with all required activities to obtain a new ATO, signed by the Authorizing Official (AO). System security controls shall be designed and implemented consistent with NIST SP 800-53 Rev 3, `Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.' All NIST SP 80053 controls must be tested / assessed no less than every 3 years, according to federal and Department policy. The risk impact level of the system will be determined via the completion of the Department's inventory form and shall meet the accurate depiction of security categorization as outlined in Federal Information Publishing Standards (FIPS) 199, `Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.' System security documentation shall be developed to record and support the implementation of the security controls for the system. This documentation shall be maintained for the life of the system. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall review and update the system security documentation at least annually and after significant changes to the system, to ensure the relevance and accurate depiction of the implemented system controls and to reflect changes to the system and its environment of operation. Security documentation must be developed in accordance with the NIST 800 series and Department of Education policy and guidance. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall allow Department employees (or Department designated third party contractors) access to the hosting facility to conduct C&A/SA activities to include control reviews in accordance with NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 3 and NIST SP 800-53A. The contractor, and all subcontractors, shall be available for interviews and demonstrations of security control compliance to support the C&A/SA process and continuous monitoring of system security. In addition, if the system is rated as `Moderate' or `High' for FIPS 199 risk impact, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing shall be performed on the hosting facility and application as part of the C&A/SA process. Appropriate access agreements will be reviewed and signed before any scanning or testing occurs. Identified deficiencies between required NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 3 controls and the contractor's, and all sub-contractor's implementation, as documented in the Risk Assessment Report, System Security Plan (SSP) and Security Assessment Report (SAR), shall be tracked for mitigation through the development of a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) in accordance with the `Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy (OCIO-01).' Depending on the severity of the deficiencies, the Department may require remediation before an ATO is issued. All awarded contracts shall ensure that: 1. Their IT product/system is monitored during all hours of operations using entrusted detective/preventive systems; 2. Their IT product/system has current antiviral products installed and operational; 3. Their IT product/system is scanned on a reoccurring basis; 4. Vulnerabilities are remediated in a timely manner on their IT product/system; and 5.

PEAR Attachment A Page 27 of 28 The Contract shall provide COTS solutions that are IPv6 capable. An IPv6 capable system or product shall be capable of receiving, processing, transmitting and forwarding IPv6 packets and/or interfacing with other systems and protocols in a manner similar to that of IPv4. Specific criteria to be deemed IPv6 capable are: ˇ ˇ ˇ An IPv6 Capable system must meet the IPv6 base requirements defined by the USGv6 Profile and Testing program as found here "http://w3.antd.nist.gov/usgv6/testing.html". Systems being developed, procured or acquired shall maintain interoperability with IPv4 systems/capabilities. Systems shall implement IPv4/IPv6dual-stack and shall also be built to determine which protocol layer to use depending on the destination host it is attempting to communicate with or establish a socket with. If either protocol is possible, systems shall employ IPv6.

ˇ

The contractor shall provide IPv6 technical support for system development, implementation and management System Development Standards Information systems shall be developed in accordance with the ED Lifecycle Management Framework (LCM), ACS-OCIO 1-106 Reporting of Data Security Breaches If there is a suspected or known breach/disclosure of PII due to lost, theft, intercepted transfer, or other, the contractor must ensure that this breach is reported to the agency as soon as the contractor has knowledge of it. Per Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-06-19, Federal agencies have a requirement to report breaches of PII security to a Federal incident response center. NCES must notify the department within 30 minutes of discovering the incident (and the agency should not distinguish between suspected or confirmed breaches). The data security plan must be written to reflect this requirement, and the contractor must provide sufficient notification and documentation of the suspected loss, as it is understood at the time of notification to the agency for this requirement to be met. Follow-up reports of the final status of loss events will also be prepared by the contractor within a reasonable period of time as advised by the NCES COR.

ATTACHMENT B Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan Postsecondary Education Analysis Resources (PEAR) (ED-IES-12-R-0057) 1. Purpose This performance-based Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) sets forth procedures and guidelines that the Department of Education ("the Department") will use in evaluating the technical performance of the Contractor. A copy of this plan will be furnished to the Contractor so that the Contractor will be aware of the methods that the Government will employ in evaluating performance on this contract and address any concerns that the Contractor may have prior to initiating work. 2. Scope The QASP is intended to accomplish the following: 1. Define the roles and responsibilities of participating Government officials 2. Describe the rating elements and standards of performance against which the Contractor's performance will be assessed 3. Describe the process of quality assurance assessment 4. Provide copies of the annual quality assurance monitoring forms that will be used by the Government in documenting and evaluating the Contractor's performance Each of these purposes is discussed in detail below. Roles and Responsibilities of Participating Government Officials The following Government Officials will participate in assessing the quality of the Contractor's performance. Their roles and responsibilities are described as follows: Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): The COR will be responsible for monitoring, assessing, recording, and reporting on the technical performance of the Contractor on a day-today basis. The COR will also be responsible for completing the Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms (described in greater detail below). It is extremely important for the COR to establish and maintain a team-oriented line of communication with the Contractor's Project Director (PD) in order to perform monitoring functions. The COR, Contracting Officer (CO), Contract Specialist (CS), and PD must work together as a team to ensure that the required work is accomplished in an efficient and proper manner. Meetings and conference calls should be held on a regular basis in order to resolve serious problems. Less serious problems should be discussed and resolved on an as-needed basis. Contract Specialist (CS): The CS will be responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the Contractor's performance in the areas of contract compliance, contract administration, cost control and property control; reviewing the COR's assessment of the Contractor's performance; and resolving all differences between the COR's version of events and the Contractor's version of events. The CS may call upon the expertise of other Government individuals as required. Contracting Officer (CO): The CO ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract, and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the CO that assures the Contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The CO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance. The CO's procurement authorities include the following:

PEAR Attachment B Page 2 of 5
         SOLE authority for any decisions which produce an increase or decrease in the scope of the contract/task order; SOLE authority for any actions subject to the Changes clause; SOLE authority for any decision to be rendered under the Disputes clause; SOLE authority to approve the substitution or replacement of the Project Director and other key personnel; SOLE authority to approve the contractor's invoices for payment, subject to the Limitation of Funds clause; Authority to arrange for and supervise Quality Assurance activities under this contract; SOLE authority to approve the contractor's Quality Control Program; To approve all contractor purchases of equipment, supplies, and materials exceeding $2,500 are encouraged even though not required by FAR 13.106; and Signatory authority for the issuance of all modifications to the contract.

Deliverables to be Assessed The Government will review all deliverables and monitor all tasks required under the contract for adherence to NCES Standards, government regulations or requirements for research studies, and general best practice research standards in addition to ensuring that the deliverables and tasks meet all requirements specified in the contract. Rating Elements and Standards of Performance The Contractor's performance will be evaluated by the COR according to three categories: "Superior," "Acceptable," and "Unacceptable." The criteria for each of these performance levels are outlined below. All products produced by or activities performed by the Contractor shall, at a minimum, meet the level of "acceptable." ˇ ˇ ˇ Unacceptable: A level of performance that is not acceptable and which fails to meet the minimum standards of performance; Acceptable: An acceptable level of performance that meets the minimum standards of performance; or Superior: A level of performance that exceeds the minimum standards of performance.

In general, the work will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements of the contract are satisfied, the extent to which the work performed follows the approach found in the Contractor's technical proposal, clarity of documentation, and timeliness of scheduled task accomplishment. At the discretion of the CO/CS and COR, other government officials approved by the CO/CS may be asked to evaluate a particular deliverable or set of deliverables. The following factors will be considered when evaluating PEAR deliverables: 1) Timeliness: When was the deliverable received? Was it received on the date specified? ˇ ˇ ˇ Unacceptable: Standard not met--Deliverable was received after the due date. Acceptable: Standard met--Deliverable was received between the period of two business days earlier than the due date and the due date. Superior: Standard exceeded--Deliverable was received three or more business days before the due date.

Note: In the event of a delay, the Contractor must notify the Department (reference FAR 52.24217 Government Delay of Work). The Department and the Contractor shall work together to modify the contract with regard to the due dates of the deliverables. If such an event were to

PEAR Attachment B Page 3 of 5
occur that would require a modification to the due dates of the deliverables, the Contractor's performance shall be measured by the date agreed upon in the modification. 2) Presentation: To what degree was the deliverable free of grammatical, typographical, and formatting errors? ˇ ˇ ˇ Unacceptable: Standard not met--Substantial numbers of corrections were needed. Acceptable: Standard met--Minor corrections were needed. Superior: Standard exceeded--No corrections were needed.

3) Responsiveness to Comments and Suggestions: Did the contractor thoughtfully consider and acknowledge comments and suggestions throughout the drafting process? Did the contractor accept specific direction from the Department regarding format or content, when such direction was given? ˇ Unacceptable: Standard not met--The Contractor had unsubstantiated disregard for reviewers' suggestions throughout the drafting process and refused to acknowledge the Department's edits/comments. Acceptable: Standard met --The Contractor employed thoughtful consideration and acknowledgement of reviewers' comments and suggestions for revisions throughout the drafting process. Superior: Standard exceeded--The Contractor employed an efficient method for soliciting edits and comments from the Department that resulted in the draft being of high quality and prepared on time.

ˇ

ˇ

4) Adherence to IES/NCES standards: Did the deliverable follow IES/NCES standards for research design, analytic procedures, and presentation of results? ˇ Unacceptable: Standard not met--The deliverable had one or more serious deficiencies in research design, analytic procedures, and/or presentation of results that would require substantial reworking of the deliverable to meet IES/NCES standards. Acceptable: Standard met --The deliverable required moderate revisions to meet IES/NCES standards for research design, analytic procedures, and presentation of results. Superior: Standard exceeded-- The deliverable demonstrated adherence to IES/NCES standards for research throughout, with minor revisions or no revisions needed.

The basic rule is this; we pay you within 30 days (Large Business) or 15 days (Small Business) of receipt of a proper invoice. There are two key terms that determine when the clock starts--receipt and proper invoice. Receipt occurs on the latter of: 1) Invoices are transmitted electronically through email (OCFOCAMInvoicing@ed.gov), we look for the date a readable transmission is received by our office, or if it is received after normal working hours we will use the next business day. 2) The seventh day after the date on which the property is actually delivered or the performance of services is actually completed. This date may not be accurate if the contract calls for a longer acceptance period or if we actually accept goods or services before the seventh day. (5 CFR § 1315.4) 3) On the date of delivery, if specified in the contract. 4) On the date placed on the invoice by the contractor, if we fail to annotate the date of receipt in our office. Second, what makes an invoice a proper invoice? An invoice is deemed proper through the following process. We receive your invoice, and then we review it for the following information, if the information is complete then we pay it: 1) Name of vendor 2) Invoice date 3) Government contract number (10 digits) 4) Vendor invoice number, account number, or other number identified in the contract 5) Description (including, for example, contract line/subline number), price, and quantity of goods or services rendered. 6) Shipping and payment terms (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 7) TIN (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 8) Banking information for payment by EFT (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 9) Contact name (where practicable), title and telephone number 10) Other substantiating documentation or information required by the contract. . If The Department determines that your invoice is not proper, we will return it to you and identify all defects that prevent payment. You should correct the invoice and return it to us for payment. 5 CFR § 1315.9

ATTACHMENT F Contractor Employee Security Screening Requirements The Department has established policy on personnel security screening for all contractor and subcontractor employees and their field staff. The relevant Departmental Directive is OM:5-101. It was last updated in July 2010 and can be found at: http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/acsom5101.pdf . The contractor must comply with the personnel security-screening requirements in OM:5-101 throughout the life of the contract. The type of screening and the timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data the contractor employee will have access to, or the type of Departmental information technology (IT) system they will access. Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause to the Department or the public. A position risk level will be assigned to each contractor employee position, before a solicitation is released, consistent with the descriptions in Appendix I of OM:5-101. Hence, each contractor employee working on this contract must be assigned a position risk level. Depending on the risk level assigned to each person's position, a follow-up background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may occur. The contractor must identify one of their employees as a security liaison for this process. This Contractor Security Liaison coordinates the distribution, collection, and dissemination of various forms required in this process. They answer general questions from their employees on completing the security screening process. And, they are the first point of contact for contractor employees in using the OPMs Internet based security screening portal called e-QIP (http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/). The contractor is also responsible for ensuring that all subcontractors follow these personnel security screening procedures. NCES requires each contractor employee to have or apply for a clearance for the security level designated for the position held on a contract. Contractor employees who have undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency will be required to submit proof of that personnel security screening for validation. For these employees, the contractor or subcontractor must follow these required steps: 1. The contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name of each employee with a pre-existing clearance, the agency that cleared the employee, the level of the clearance, and the date of the clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an NCES contract. 2. In those cases where any of the required information on level of clearance, agency that cleared the employee and date of clearance is not available, the contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name and Social Security Number for each employee with a pre-existing clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an NCES contract.

PEAR Attachment F Page 2 of 6

3. The COR will transmit the letter to the NCES Security Representative for processing. 4. The NCES Security Representative reviews the letter to ensure that the required information is provided and either returns it to the contractor for completion or releases it to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security. The contractor must resubmit the letter to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract. 5. The NCES Security Representative will notify the contractor or subcontractor if the pre-existing clearance was identified and ruled to be acceptable by the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security. 6. Those employees whose pre-existing clearances are not verified and approved must follow the process outlined next to apply for a security clearance. For contractor employees who have not undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency, all contractors must comply with the Principal Office (PO) Executive Office or Computer Security Officers pre-processing requirements for personnel security screening and granting access privileges. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (i.e., personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have submitted applicable security screening documents. For each contractor employee in a moderate risk level position the completed security screening documents must be accepted by the COR and the NCES Security Representative and submitted to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. In order to meet this Departmental requirement, steps 1 through 7 must be completed within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. To meet this 14 day deadline and the interim deadlines specified below, it is strongly recommended that the contractor request the account initiation three (3) weeks before the contractor employee starts contract work and encourage each contractor employee to complete all required security screening forms before starting contract work. Contractor employees in High Risk IT (6C) Level positions require preliminary personnel security screenings before they are given access to unclassified sensitive information or Department of Education IT systems (see page 7 of OM:5-101 for more details). The security screening of contractor and subcontractor employees not holding ED recognized security screening credentials must follow these required steps: 1. The contractor must provide the COR with an electronic listing of all employees on a specific contract, with the risk level associated with the position held by each employee as specified in the contract solicitation. The COR will review the electronic listing for completeness and approve. The listing will not be approved if it is found to be incomplete.

PEAR Attachment F Page 3 of 6

2. The Department of Education participates in the OPM e-QIP system to facilitate the security screening process for contractor employees. NCES will initiate an e-QIP account for each contractor employee. It is advisable to request the account initiation three (3) weeks before the contractor employee starts contract work. For the initiation of these accounts, the Contractor Security Liaison must use the COR-approved list of employees and the risk levels assigned to the employees positions to produce and submit the following list using the attached template: a. For each contractor employee provide: Social Security Number, Full Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth, risk level, e-Mail Address, and phone number. The Contractor Security Liaison must place the spreadsheet in a password protected file, then upload the list to the NCES secure server, and send an e-mail notification of the transmission to the NCES Security Representative. The NCES security staff will use this list to establish the contactor employee e-QIP accounts. The COR will work with the contractor to establish access to the NCES secure server at the outset of the contract. b. Once NCES sets up the e-QIP accounts for contract employees, the NCES Security Representative will send an email to the Contractor Security Liaison stating that the employee has an active account on the e-QIP system. The COR is copied on this email notification. c. The Contractor Security Liaison must notify their employees of this active account. A computer with Internet access and web browsing software is required for the contractor employee to access their E-QIP account. Each employee must log into their personal account in e-QIP, enter the requested information, finish the application process and print, sign, and date the e-QIP signature pages.

3. Each contractor employee must submit a completed set of security screening forms to their Contractor Security Liaison as provided by the NCES Security Representative, including for example: a. The signed and dated e-QIP signature pages, b. The Declaration of Federal Employment (OPM form OF-306), c. The Fair Credit Release Form,

d. The Request for Security Officer Action (RSA) Form, 1) The contractor employee shall complete only those items in section 1 of the form (name, date of birth, place of birth, organization, position title, duty station, social security number, and work phone number). 2) The contractor shall complete section 5 (Project Requiring Highest ADP Level) using the assigned security clearance for each employee's position. e. Two sets of fingerprints on separate copies of form FD-258, 1) The Contractor Security Liaison shall help arrange fingerprinting for each contractor and subcontractor employee. Fingerprinting can usually be done at a local police station. (Electronic fingerprints are not accepted at this time.)

PEAR Attachment F Page 4 of 6

4. Each contractor must ensure that the forms are complete and that all contractor employee required security screening forms are transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of an employee starting work on an NCES contract. a. The Contractor Security Liaison must collate the forms in each security screening package by employee and transmit a complete set of security screening documents for each employee to the COR via courier (e.g., Federal Express) using a tracking number with signature required, b. The COR will not accept security screening packages that are not collated by employee (i.e., all forms noted in point 3 above will be bundled by employee). The COR will review all security screening documents for each contractor employee for completeness, returning any incomplete security screening documents to the Contractor Security Liaison for completion. The contractor must resubmit the completed security screening documents to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have resubmitted applicable screening documents. 5. The COR will submit the completed packages of security screening documents to the NCES Security Representative for processing.

6. The NCES Security Representative reviews each package of security screening documents and electronic information submission to ensure everything required has been provided and either rejects the package, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security. In the event that an application is rejected at this stage, the contractor must resubmit the corrected forms to the COR, or have the contractor employee correct the e-QIP submission, within two business days. The NCES Security Representative must be notified as soon as the updated e-QIP submission is completed.

7. The contractor employee application for each individual in a moderate risk level position must be submitted to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. Contractor employees in High Risk IT (6C) Level positions require preliminary personnel security screenings before they are given access to unclassified sensitive information or Department of Education IT systems.

8. After a package of security screening documents is transmitted to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security, the Office of Management security staff conducts a further review and either rejects the package of security screening documents, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to OPM.

9. OPM then assigns an investigator to conduct the type of investigation indicated by the department (this is tied to the level of access to PII that the applicant will have).

PEAR Attachment F Page 5 of 6

10. The Chief of Personnel Security will request the expansion of background investigations to obtain additional information to the extent necessary to make personnel acceptability or suitability determinations. These determinations will be made using criteria established by the OPM for the purpose of determining suitability for employment in the Federal competitive service, as described in 5 CFR 731.202, and other OPM guidance as applicable. The Chief of Personnel Security determines whether a contractor employee is acceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint.

11. When the OPM investigation is complete, the RSA form with the clearance indicated is sent to the Department of Education's Office of Management for processing.

12. The Office of Management returns the RSA form to the NCES Security Representative for recordation and distribution to the COR.

13. The COR transmits the RSA form with clearance indicated to the Contractor Security Liaison for their records and for distribution to the Contract Project Leader.

14. The Contract Project Leader then distributes copies of the clearance to the employee.

15. The Chief of Personnel Security will inform the NCES COR when he or she determines that a contractor employee is not acceptable to render service(s) or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under a contract.

16. Each contractor will officially notify its contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on an ED contract.

17. In the event a contractor employee is deemed unacceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint, the Chief of Personnel Security will usually provide the contractor employee with an opportunity to refute, explain, clarify, or mitigate information in question.

18. If, after final determination by the Chief of Personnel Security, a decision is made that the contractor employee is not acceptable to render services on a contract and access is denied, the COR will inform the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer must inform the contractor (i.e. employing firm) that the contractor employee is not acceptable to render services in this particular position, or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under the contract. The contractor will notify the contractor employee. A final determination cannot be appealed.

19. At any time during the life of the contract a contractor or subcontractor employee (including any field staff) discontinues work on the contract or leaves the employment of the contractor, the contractor shall notify the COR within two days of the date that the employee is no longer working on the contract or within one business day if removed for cause. The contractor shall provide the reason why the employee is no longer working on the contract. The COR will provide this information to the NCES Security Representative.

PEAR Attachment F Page 6 of 6

20. Each contractor is responsible for the protection of sensitive or Privacy Act-protected information from unauthorized use or misuse by its employees, subcontractors, or temporary workers, and for preventing access to others, who are not authorized and have no need to know such information.

21. The contractor shall submit monthly information to the COR indicating which employees were billed to the contract that include the e-QIP number of the person being billed. The COR will reject payments to employees without an e-QIP number. For employees with pre-existing clearances from other contracts, this shall be noted on the monthly payment form. The contractor shall verify with the COR that the security screening processes have not changed by the time the contract is active.

SECTION H SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
H. 1 3452.209-71 CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MAY 2011)

(a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, has certified that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest) for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person`s objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) of interest regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest), including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the contracting officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest.

PAGE 13 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

(d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (End of Clause)

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS (MAY 2011)

PAGE 14 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

(a) In accordance with Department of Education regulations on the protection of human subjects in research, title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, part 97 ("the regulations"), the contractor, any subcontractors, and any other entities engaged in covered (nonexempt) research activities are required to establish and maintain procedures for the protection of human subjects. The definitions in 34 CFR 97.102 apply to this clause. As used in this clause, covered research means research involving human subjects that is not exempt under 34 CFR 97.101(b) and 97.401(b). (b) If ED determines that proposed research activities involving human subjects are covered (i.e., not exempt under the regulations), the contracting officer or contacting officer`s designee will require the contractor to apply for the Federal Wide Assurance from the Office for Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, if the contractor does not already have one on file. The contracting officer will also require that the contractor obtain and send to the Department documentation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval of the research. (c) In accordance with 34 CFR part 97, all subcontractors and any legally separate entity (neither owned nor operated by the contractor) that will be engaged in covered research activities under or related to this contract shall be required to comply with the requirements for assurances and IRB approvals. The contractor must include the substance of this clause, including paragraph (c) of this clause, in all subcontracts, and must notify any other entities engaged in the covered research activities of their responsibility to comply with the regulations. (d) Under no condition shall the contractor conduct, or allow to be conducted, any covered research activity involving human subjects prior to the Department`s receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. (34 CFR 97.103(f)). No covered research involving human subjects shall be initiated under this contract until the contractor has provided the contracting officer (or the contracting officer`s designee) a properly completed certification form certifying IRB review and approval of the research activity, and the contracting officer or designee has received the certification. This restriction applies to the activities of each participating entity. (e) In accordance with 34 CFR 97.109(e), an IRB must conduct continuing reviews of covered research activities at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once a year. Covered research activities that are expected to last one year or more are therefore subject to review by an IRB at least once a year. (1) For each covered activity under this contract that requires continuing review, the contractor shall submit an annual written representation to the contracting officer (or the contracting officer`s designee) stating whether covered research activities have been reviewed and approved by an IRB within the previous 12 months. The contractor may use the form titled "Protection of Human Subjects: Assurance Identification/Certification/Declaration of Exemption" for this representation. For multi-institutional projects, the contractor shall provide this information on its behalf and on behalf of any other entity engaged in covered research activities for which continuing IRB reviews are required. (2) If the IRB disapproves, suspends, terminates, or requires modification of any covered research activities under this contract, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer in writing of the IRB`s action. (f) The contractor shall bear full responsibility for performing as safely as is feasible all activities under this contract involving the use of human subjects and for complying with all applicable regulations and requirements concerning human subjects. No one (neither the contractor, nor any subcontractor, agent, or employee of the contractor, nor any other person or organization, institution, or group of any kind whatsoever) involved in the performance of such activities shall be deemed to constitute an agent or employee of the Department of Education or of the Federal government with respect to such activities. The contractor agrees to discharge its obligations, duties, and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring professional judgment or otherwise, as an independent contractor without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of the contractor and its employees. (g) Upon discovery of any noncompliance with any of the requirements or standards stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, the contractor shall immediately correct the deficiency. If at any time during performance of this contract, the contracting officer determines, in consultation with the Protection of Human Subjects Coordinator, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, or the sponsoring office, that the contractor is not in compliance with any of the requirements or standards stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in part, work and further payments under this contract until the contractor corrects such noncompliance. Notice of the suspension may be communicated by telephone and confirmed in writing. (h) The Government may terminate this contract, in full or in part, for failure to fully comply with any regulation or requirement related to human subjects involved in research. Such termination may be in lieu of or in addition to suspension of work or payment. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the Government`s right to terminate the contract for failure to fully comply with such requirements. (i) The regulations, and related information on the protection of human research subjects, can be found on the Department`s protection of human subjects in research Web site: http://ed.gov/

316-1 ACCESSIBILITY OF SOFTWARE (OCTOBER 1999)

The Department of Education (ED) considers universal accessibility to information a priority for all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. Under Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d,as amended), ED must ensure the accessibility of its programs and activities, specifically its obligation to acquire and use accessible electronic and information technology. ED maintains the manual, "Requirements for Accessible Software Design," to convey the accessibility

needs of the Department to the developers and suppliers of computer applications. To comply with the provisions of this

clause, the contractor may use the edition of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design" in effect at the date of award of this contract or any more recent edition. A copy of the most recent edition of the manual may be found at http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/apply/clibrary/software.html (a) Software delivered to or developed for ED--Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this clause, all software delivered to or developed for ED, under this contract, for use by ED's employees or external customers must meet all the requirements of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." However, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may waive a particular requirement of the ED Manual, provided that ED's use of the software will meet the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d, as amended). (b) Software enhanced or modified for ED--Any enhancements and other modifications, made under this contract to software for use by ED's employees or external customers, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause, regardless of where or how the software was first
PAGE 21 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

developed. Except as otherwise specified elsewhere in the contract schedule, the contractor is only required to ensure that enhancements or modifications (not other, preexisting features or components) of the software fully comply with the accessibility requirements of paragraph (a). However, the contractor is encouraged point out any preexisting features or components that do not meet accessibility requirements and to suggest solutions to ensure the software complies. (c) Waiver of requirements--It is recognized that new technologies may provide solutions that are not envisioned in or consistent with the provisions of the manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." Also, compliance with certain requirements of the manual may not be feasible for the particular software required. In such extraordinary circumstances, the contracting officer may grant a waiver, in writing, to any requirement of the manual or of this clause if it furthers a public interest of ED and will not significantly impair ED's ability to ensure accessibility of its programs and activities to all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. To request a waiver, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, listing the specific accessibility requirements that would not be met and explaining how the accessibility of a particular feature can be achieved by alternative means or why it is not feasible to make a feature of the software accessible. (d) Condition of payment--The contractor agrees that compliance with the provisions of this clause upon delivery of the software to ED is a condition of payment under this contract.

(End of Clause) I. 67 3452.209-71 CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MAY 2011)

(a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, has certified that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest) for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity - A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests
PAGE 29 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person`s objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) of interest regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest), including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the contracting officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e).

(End of Provision) K. 2 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have /_/ have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision. (D) Have /_/, have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
PAGE 34 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

(ii) The Offeror has /_/ has not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror`s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of Provision) K. 5 3452.209-70 CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (MAY 2011)

(a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of
PAGE 37 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person`s objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (f) Conflict of Interest Certification. The offeror, ____________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. __________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government`s satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

(a) "Definitions." As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer`s discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation`s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) "Amendments to solicitations." If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) "Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals."

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--

PAGE 43 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government`s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation. (6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award. (7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. (8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (d) "Offer expiration date." Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) "Restriction on disclosure and use of data." Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection withthe submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government`s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) "Contract award." (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government`s interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror`s initial proposal should contain the offeror`s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would
PAGE 44 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government`s best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency`s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror`s offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror . (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

corporate or organizational past performance, the offeror may substitute
PAGE 47 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

past performance of a predecessor company or of the offeror's management or proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. A. Each offeror shall submit information about its most recent four contracts, completed in the last three years or currently in process, which are of similar size, scope, complexity or, in any way, are relevant to the effort required by this solicitation. If the offeror's last four similar contracts are all currently in process, submit the last three similar contracts currently in process, and the most recent similar contract completed within the last three years. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers. Contracts with the parent or an affiliate of the offeror may not be used. Include the following information for each contract and subcontract: 1. Identification a. Name of the contracting activity b. Program title or product name c. Contract number d. Contract type e. Period of performance, including all option periods f. Contract Value: (1) Initial projected total contract amount including all option periods (2) Final or current projected total contract amount including all option periods g. Points of Contact (1) Contracting officer and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) (2) Administrative contracting officer, if different from above, and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) (3) Program manager, COTR or technical officer and telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known) 2. Work performed and relevance a. Brief synopsis of work performed b. Brief discussion of how the work performed is relevant to the statement of work in this solicitation c. Brief, specific examples of the offeror's high quality performance 3. If any of the listed contracts are award-fee or incentive contracts, include a table showing fees awarded and the minimum and maximum available fee for each period. 4. Paragraph E. below requires you to send a copy of the "Contractor Information Form" to each of your references. In your past performance report, include: a. The date you sent the "Contractor Information Form" to each reference. b. How you sent it (e.g., fax, mail, express delivery service, courier, e-mail, etc.). c. To whom you sent it including telephone and fax number and e-mail address (if known). B. The offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified in A above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. Other than the information requested in A above, offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references. C. Offerors should understand the difference between experience and past performance. Experience reflects the offeror's capability of performing a requirement. Past performance reflects how well it has performed similar requirements. In assessing past performance, the
PAGE 48 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

quality of the offeror's past performance is of primary significance, not the quantity of previous contracts performed. An offeror's experience will be evaluated in the technical proposal. For further guidance on including information on experience or how experience will be evaluated refer to the technical proposal instructions and evaluation criteria. D. The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications(e.g., the automobile industry's QS 9000, Sematech's SSQA, or ANSI/EIA-599). Identify which segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. Information about awards will be considered in evaluation of each of the past performance subfactors described in Section M. The offeror may describe how the award relates to one or more of the subfactors. E. No later than the date proposals are due under this solicitation (see Block 9 of Standard Form 33), send a copy to each of your four references of the "Contractor Performance Information" form attached to this solicitation.Ask each reference to complete the form and return it to the contracting officer as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due l0 calendar days after the date proposals are due under this solicitation. Request that the reference please return the completed form to the contracting officer by this date. Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the completed form or any information therefrom. Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Contractor Performance Information" form identified in Section J will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. L. 12

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS In preparation for writing their proposals, offerors are encouraged to review the contents of webpages on the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/) that detail its three primary postsecondary studies: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS), and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B). Familiarity with these studies' purposes and methodology, along with the resulting reports, should be evidenced in offerors' responses. Offerors may also benefit by reviewing public-facing Web tools developed by NCES to permit users to generate tables and regressions from its postsecondary studies. Those tools are located at http://nces.ed.gov/datalab. Support for these tools is being sought via a related requirement, Postsecondary Education Data Structure Support, ED-IES-12-R-0056. The Department anticipates fulfilling PEAR requirements:

(1) via a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with Firm-Fixed- Price Level of Effort tasks below:
Subtask 2.5. Response to Professional Judgment Reviews Subtask 2.6. Pre-release Quality Control Task 4. Ad-Hoc Analysis

(2) awarded after a full and open competition, (3) that will be funded incrementally.
Proposal structure Offerors are requested to prepare a proposal containing the following four components: 1) technical proposal, 2) business (cost) proposal, 3) past performance report, and 4) subcontracting proposal, if applicable. Each component must be separately packaged and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the other. General Instructions Technical Proposal The offeror must demonstrate corporate and proposed staff experience and expertise in the areas applicable to this project, as specified in the evaluation criteria. While the intent of each task is spelled out in the work statement, it is up to the offeror to propose the most effective method for carrying out these tasks. The task specifications contained in the RFP are a starting point; the proposal is expected to build on them, providing examples, where appropriate, not simply repeating the language contained in the RFP. Offerors are encouraged to suggest technical improvements to the work. Any proposed changes to the scope of the work or to the deliverable dates shall be justified. It is important that the offeror completely address all the tasks described in the performance work statement and provide enough detail on the

PAGE 50 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

offeror's approach to each task to allow a review panel to adequately judge that approach. The panel will not make assumptions or guesses: all information necessary to judge the technical soundness and management capabilities of the offeror will be contained in the technical proposal. The technical proposal must not contain reference to specific costs, but resource information (e.g., staff hours) shall be included so that the offeror's understanding of the scope of the work may be evaluated. Authors of each section shall be clearly identified in the proposal's table of contents. Business Proposal The business proposal will contain all information related to the determination of the costs associated with each of the project's tasks. Although not explicitly anticipated as part of this contract, please note that any printing that exceeds the threshold outlined in the March 2011 EDAR Clause 3452.208-71, "Printing," shall be arranged through the contractor to be done through Government Printing Office (GPO). However, the cost of this printing will be paid by the contractor to GPO. Contents of the Technical Proposal The technical proposal shall consist of the following sections:

1. Table of Contents: The Table of Contents will provide an easy means to identify authors and
major points of discussion.

2. Introduction: The Introduction shall present the offeror's concept of the purposes, methodology,
and products of the project, and shall include a short summary of the offeror's qualifications and unique strengths related to project tasks.

3. General Approach: The General Approach section shall provide the rationale for the proposed
approach, describe the offeror's overall plan to accomplish the work successfully, indicate what the contractor sees as the most challenging aspects of the collection contract, and how the contractor plans to address these challenges.

4. Statement of Work: The Statement of Work sections in the technical proposal must correspond to
the Statement of Work sections included in the government's RFP. The offeror's Statement of Work expands upon each of the tasks outlined in the government's PWS and discusses procedural issues related to completing each task. The offeror's plan for carrying out each task, including the naming of staff members who will play a major role in completing the task, must be clearly stated. Any variations to the tasks and subtasks defined herein should be accompanied by a rationale. If the variation affects the overall cost of the project, this should be indicated in the

PAGE 51 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

technical proposal and alternative designs should separately provide a cost breakdown in the business proposal. Offerors are encouraged to propose alternatives that, if adopted, would improve upon the project or reduce the costs. However, for evaluation purposes, the offeror should also submit a proposal to perform the work as specified in this document. Management, Staffing, and Scheduling: The project requires that the contractor has in place an effective management system that enables tasks to be completed on schedule and within budget. The project management section details the offeror's plan for managing the project, including proposed lines of authority, coordination and communication within the offeror's organization and with any subcontractors, consultants, and the Department. It should include discussions, specific to the tasks outlined in the PWS, of the offeror's procedures for: coordinating and controlling project personnel, resources, and tasks; ensuring adherence to schedules and deadlines; ensuring high quality products and outcomes; identifying potential problems early; maintaining close communication with the Department COR; and controlling project expenditures. Descriptions that are limited to the offeror's general approach to project management will not be considered a full response. All personnel, including subcontractor staff and consultants, must be identified, and their positions in the projects management structure are detailed in an organization chart. It includes a staff skills matrix that identifies the project director and key project staff by skill area (e.g., analysis, editing, page layout, helpdesk). All key staff of subcontractors are identified and described in the same way and listed in the staff skills matrix. The matrix shall include sufficient detail on how each project staff member will be used to illustrate why the person is being proposed for a given task. In all cases where key personnel external to the offeror's organization are proposed, letters of agreement (with proposed staff) and letters of availability (endorsed by the primary organizations with which they are affiliated) are to be included. For purposes of the offer, staff is defined as all personnel proposed to work on the project regardless of their primary affiliation or specific assignment. A person-loading chart that shows the number of hours each key staff member will devote to each of the project tasks and the number of total hours each will devote to the core and optional tasks should be included in this section of the offeror's technical proposal. The hours for other project staff are reported by labor category. A similar chart is required for each option. The offeror should also provide information on each proposed staff person's level of commitment (in terms of hours) to PEAR and to other projects and administrative activities. The offeror shall identify the other projects and how much time is committed to them by project. Offerors must clearly state how many hours equals one full-time equivalent in their organization. This section also shall include a project management chart depicting the timelines for all major tasks and

PAGE 52 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

subtasks, including deliverables, meetings, etc. Included in this chart shall be the start and completion dates for each task, as well as intermediate dates for precursor steps and draft deliverables, as appropriate. Staff responsible for each task shall also be included on the chart.

5. Related Experience of Proposed Staff: The Proposed Staff Related Experience section shall
contain a summary for each proposed key staff member that indicates how his/her prior work experience and educational background relates to his/her proposed role on the contract. Primary areas of expertise must be clearly specified. The summary should be limited to the two or three experiences that best qualify the staff member for the role he/she will play on the contract. Offerors are encouraged to submit résumés or current vitae for each staff member proposed for the project. These documents must list: 1) each degree earned, including the date when each was confirmed, the confirming institution, and the major field of study; 2) any professional certifications, if applicable; 3) no more than four prior/current work or project experiences; and 3) for staff involved in analysis tasks, no more than 10 publications and professional presentations. List only previous work experience and publications that are directly relevant to the staff member's proposed work for the project. The offeror's proposal must include a matrix that clearly identifies:

(1) the key competencies it deems necessary for the successful completion of each task, and (2) which of its proposed project staff members possess each of the above skills and expertise.
The section shall also fully describe the qualifications and experience of the proposed project director. The project director is critical to the project because this person sets its tone and direction. Most important is the individual's management experience and skills. The project director must be able to organize and oversee, manage, and control the quality of staff performance on many tasks simultaneously. The project director must be a good leader: strong; confident; and capable of not only inspiring project staff to perform productively as team members, but of taking whatever corrective action is required to insure quality performance. The project director is expected to be a problem solver and a good communicator. Finally, the project director should be a person who can feel comfortable working closely with the COR and Project Officer as colleagues. In summary, the project director should have these traits and a demonstrated ability to meet deadlines, to produce qualitatively sound products within budget, and to keep the COR informed of and involved in major decisions or events that are likely to affect the project's performance and products.

PAGE 53 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

The Department believes that this contract is best served by the leadership of a single project director supported by a strong staff. While joint project directorships (e.g., project director and principal investigator) are acceptable, offerors proposing such management arrangements should clearly demonstrate how such a structure will benefit the project. Moreover, the lines of authority between these different project management positions should be clearly defined. Key project personnel should also be persons who can make a long-range commitment to the project. Their competencies should complement those of the project director and they should be individuals who can feel they are part of the project director's team. They should be people with demonstrated ability to meet deadlines and to produce high quality products. They must have expertise which matches their assigned responsibilities on the project. Any changes or substitutions of these key personnel require advance approval by the CO in consultation with the COR. Please also provide a list of proposed key personnel in the business proposal.

6. Related Corporate Experience: This section should describe the offeror's capability and
experience related to the tasks described in the PWS. Offerors should include in their proposal a matrix that clearly identifies which of its prior and ongoing corporate projects are demonstrative of its expertise in each of the above areas. The Corporate Experience section shall contain a description of the approach that the offeror will use to provide corporate oversight for the contract. This section includes detailed information on how project expenditures will be monitored and controlled. The specific steps that the offeror will take to insure the quality of the work and products, and to identify problems in performance, should be clearly defined. The Corporate Experience section shall also describe the offeror's past experience in conducting projects of a similar nature and magnitude. One-page abstracts of related work should be included which clearly identify scope of work of these prior projects and their time frame and current status (e.g., complete, ongoing). The name, current affiliation, and current telephone number of the project's COR (or equivalent, if not government-sponsored) should be specified. These CORs may be asked to report their experience on the project (size, problems, overruns, responsiveness, flexibility, and product quality).

7. Small Business Subcontracting Proposal: The Small Business proposal describes the offeror's
plans to incorporate small businesses in the work of the contract. The Small Business -proposal shall describe which parts of which tasks shall be performed by small businesses and how the contractor plans on managing the work of the small businesses. The Department values an approach where substantive work in a meaningful capacity is performed by small businesses more highly than an approach in which only menial work or supply line work is performed by small

PAGE 54 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

businesses. A meaningful capacity for substantive work includes work other than courier services, office supplies or travel services. Therefore, a valued approach for this contract will be one in which technical, analytical, data collection, or significant service is performed by a small business. Offerors shall state the work to be performed by a small business and the percentage of work proposed to be performed by a small business. The offeror shall also state the name of the small business and type of small business concern. Please provide a listing of all subcontractors including small businesses by proposed percentage, type, and proposed tasks on the cover sheet of the Subcontracting Proposal. Attachment C (Small Business Subcontracting Plan) is the small business subcontracting plan to be used by large businesses in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-9 to denote how much work small business partners are expected to have in this contract and what kind of work will be done by small businesses. Other kinds of subcontractors are allowed as well. Proposals that include plans to subcontract parts of the work shall provide evidence that any proposed subcontractor has agreed to perform the work specified in the proposal, is fully capable of performing the assigned tasks, and that the offeror has effective control of the subcontractor's work on the project. Offerors are encouraged to utilize small businesses as partners for this contract. Offeror's have the option of creating a joint venture or a teaming arrangement between businesses. Offerors subcontracting proposals are expected to meet or exceed the Department's small business subcontracting goals in all categories for a successful proposal. The Department's current procurement small business goals can be found at: http://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/reg/clibrary/sbgoals.html

8. All offerors shall address how they will work within the attached Quality Assurance Surveillance
Plan. Contents of the Business Proposal The business proposal shall contain detailed cost information for staff, consultants, subcontractors, travel, meetings, hotels, communications, and supplies. Labor hours for project personnel shall be easily reconciled with the person-loading chart provided in the technical proposal. The cost/price proposal shall also identify funds expected to be used to pay for work done by small businesses. The Department anticipates awarding a firm-fixed-price contract with firm-fixed-price level of effort tasks, funded incrementally. The Offeror shall submit proposed costs and/or prices for each task and for the project overall. The proposed budget for each task shall include the number of hours each staff person is expected to commit.

PAGE 55 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

Offerors shall include the price of each deliverable for those tasks that are Firm Fixed Price. Offerors shall propose a Pricing and Payment Schedule for the Firm Fixed Price tasks based on the price per deliverable. The Department will pay the corresponding invoice only after the Department has accepted each fixed price deliverable. Special Notes to Offerors Special Note on Deliverables Under Tasks 2, 3, and 4 As noted in the PWS, the types of analyses and reporting formats desired by NCES can vary widely. For example, NCES pose a research question best addressed via a large number of simple tables based on a single data source requiring minimal formatting (e.g., Web Tables), or it may pose a question that involves multivariate statistics (e.g., logistic regression, weighted least squares regression, survival analysis) using multiple datasets that form the basis of a Statistics in Brief or Statistical Analysis Report requiring the creation of complex tables and graphics. As a result, offerors should:

(1) Identify separately costs associated with producing each of the primary reporting formats
identified in the PWS (e.g., Web Tables, Statistics in Brief, and Statistical Analysis Reports), and

(2) Identify separately costs associated with components of an analysis that are expected to incur the
government additional costs (e.g., the use of multiple cycles of a study, specific statistical techniques). Special Note on Task 2.6 As noted in the PWS, the PEAR contractor will be required to work with IES IT and its contractors (most notably the PEDSS contractor) to ensure that any newly derived variables used in statistical analyses are made available to the general public via NCES's PowerStats data tool. NCES expects that both the technical and cost proposals will reflect the offeror's anticipation of the ways in which there will be overlap between functions detailed in PEAR and PEDSS, and their associated costs. Submitting Proposals An official authorized to bind your organization must sign the proposal . You must submit the technical proposal electronically to SCOTT.FRANKEL@ED in WORD and PDF format and the cost/price proposal as an EXCEL WORKBOOK. In addition, you must submit one original and 6 hard copies of your technical proposal and one original and 4 hard copies of your business proposal. The proposals should be bound in 3-ring binders. Offerors are encouraged to conserve paper by copying double-sided. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals on recycled paper with a high post-consumer waste content.

Criteria for Evaluation

Proposals that merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government's Scope of Work shall be considered nonresponsive to this request and will not be considered further. The offeror shall submit a definitive proposal for the end results that are set forth in the Government's requirements. Proposals shall be evaluated against the evaluation factors specified below with each criterion weighted as indicated. I. BASIS OF AWARD (a) The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government (i.e., that which represents the best value to the Government), cost or price and other factors considered. (b) The Government will use the following factors to evaluate proposals and make a best value determination (factors are listed in descending order of importance): 1. 2. 3. 4. Technical Past Performance Extent of Participation of Small Business Concerns Cost Realism and Reasonableness

(c) All of the evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. (d) The Government may award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer. In the event that two or more offers are considered technically equivalent, the evaluated cost or price will be of primary importance in determining the proposal most advantageous to the Government.

III. PAST PERFORMANCE Each offer's past performance will be evaluated based on the subfactors below. The past performance rating will be based on 25 points. In addition to determining if the declared past performance is relevant, and similar in size, scope and complexity, past performance shall be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors that are of equal importance:

PAGE 62 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

1. Past performance subfactors: a. Quality of Product or Service - compliance with contract requirements - accuracy of reports appropriateness of personnel - technical excellence. b. Problem Resolution - anticipates and avoids or mitigates problems - satisfactorily overcomes or resolves problems - prompt notification of problems - pro-active effective contractor-recommended solutions. c. Cost Control - within budget - current, accurate and complete billings - costs properly allocated - unallowable costs not billed - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies. d. Timeliness of Performance - meets interim milestones - reliable - stays on schedule despite problems - responsive to technical direction - completes on time, including wrapup and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed. e. Business Relations - effective management - use of performance-based management techniques - business-like concern for the customer's interests - effective management and selection of subcontractors - effective small/small disadvantaged business subcontracting program - reasonable/ cooperative behavior - effective use of technology in management and communication flexible ­ minimal staff turnover - maintains high employee morale - resolves disagreements without being unnecessarily litigious. f. Customer Service - understands and embraces service and program goals - team approach with the customer - satisfaction of end users with the contractor's service positive customer feedback - prompt responses - courteous interactions - effective escalations and referrals initiative and proactive improvements - creative service strategies. 2. Past performance evaluation will be based on information obtained from the awards and references listed in the offeror's proposal, other customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and others who may have useful and relevant information. Information will also be considered regarding any major subcontractors, and key personnel records. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance will be considered. The contracting officer will give greater consideration to information about an offeror's past performance that the contracting officer considers either more reliable or more relevant to the effort required by this solicitation.

PAGE 63 OF 64 ED-IES-12-R-0057

3. Evaluation of past performance may be quite subjective, based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will include consideration of the offeror's commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment. 4. An offeror will be given an opportunity to discuss adverse past performance information, if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to comment on the information. The contracting officer may review recent contracts to ensure that corrective measures raised in discussions have been implemented. Prompt corrective action in an isolated instance might not outweigh an overall negative trend 5. If no relevant information on past performance is available for an offeror, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably credited. IV. EXTENT OF PARTICIPATION OF SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS The Government will assess the offeror's proposed subcontracting goals. The offeror's will receive a pass/fail rating based on the degree of participation and the extent the offeror plans to identify and commit to subcontracting with small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned and service-disabled small business, HUBZone small business, and woman-owned small business including providing subcontracting opportunities for small, small disadvantages, women-owned, disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone small businesses. The offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine the realism of the proposed subcontracting goals and the likelihood of successful accomplishment of the goals. V. COST/PRICE Cost/Price proposals will be evaluated for cost reasonableness in accordance with FAR 15.404. Cost will not be numerically scored but will be taken into account in the selection in accordance with the RFP. Additionally, the offeror's responsibility will be ascertained in accordance with FAR 9.1041.

6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 PROCEEDINGS MS. JOHNSON: Welcome to the United States Department of Education Pre-Solicitation Conference for the two planned procurements within the Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics. The first procurement is titled, "The Postsecondary Education Analysis Resources," also known by the acronym "PEAR," P-E-A-R. And the second procurement is titled, "The Postsecondary Education Data Structure Support," also known by the acronym "PEDSS," P- E-D-S-S. The PEDSS is a small business set-aside. My name is Deila Johnson. I am the contracting officer for these two planned procurements. The purpose of today's conference is to disseminate information to potential offerors about these requirements. Although the PEAR and the PEDSS are two separate contracts, they are parallel contracts which will require collaboration between the winning contractors. This Pre-Solicitation Conference serves as an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 the solicitation when released. There are bathrooms and water fountains located on this floor, and Department of Education staff or security can direct you to them. We thank you for your interest in attending this Pre-Solicitation Conference, and those of you on the conference call line. At this time, I introduce to you Scott Frankel, the Contract Specialist for the PEDSS and the PEAR. Introductions MR. FRANKEL: How is everybody doing? My name is Scott Frankel. I'm going to be the Contract Specialist on both of these procurements. I'm also a contracting officer at Department of Education for the Contracts Acquisition Management Division, along with Deila. We have two representatives in the back actually for our small business liaison, which is Helen Chang. Helen, can you stand up for me one second? (Ms. Chang stands.) 8

7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 integral part of our market research and vendor communication. A decision has not been made on the procurement vehicle, be it full and open or GWAC or Federal Supply Schedule, et cetera. However, we are gathering information from the market to determine the best acquisition strategy for both requirements. Today we will provide you overviews of NCES, the National Center of Education Statistics, and its post-secondary division, as well as overviews of the PEAR and the PEDSS. Questions will be accepted from attendees in written form. Those questions, along with the questions received in advance of the PreSolicitation Conference will be addressed in written form and included with documents accompanying the solicitation when released. There are no cards available to write your questions on, and you should have probably seen them whenever you signed in outside. We ask that you put all cell phones and other electronic devices on vibrate at this time. This PreSolicitation Conference is being recorded, and a written verbatim transcript of this Pre-Solicitation Conference will be included with documents accompanying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 MR.

We are, by budget, the third largest federal statistical agency, after Census and BLS. Alas, we are the eighth in staffing. We fulfill a congressional mandate to collect, analyze, and report data. And these data are provided to the United Congress, other federal agencies, state agencies, educational organizations, news organizations, business organizations, and the general public. The Postsecondary, Adult, and Career Education Division of the National Center for Education Statistics is responsible for the collection and dissemination of data for everything that happens after high school. That's the simple way of putting it. The government's most important collection of data from postsecondary institutions, the integrated postsecondary education data system, which is a universe survey of those institutions participating in the federal student aid programs is one of our core responsibilities as well as three complex sample

22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 surveys that examine how students pay for their education -- the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the progress and completion of beginning students, properly named the "Beginning Postsecondary Students Study," and the post-schooling experiences of bachelor degree graduates, inventively named "Baccalaureate and Beyond" -- are core responsibilities in the area of sample survey data collection. These collections play a central role in the policy work of the United States Department of Education, the Executive Office of the President. They are heavily used by the nation's higher education community and by the nation's press. For example, twothirds of all press inquiries to the National Center for Education Statistics are directed to the Postsecondary, Adult, and Career Education Division about the postsecondary data. In a typical week, that's about 75 inquiries. This means that we have a duty to make our data available. More specifically, we must have data tools that allow all of these audiences to generate their own analysis using our data in a non-restricted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 are key areas of what might be described as joint production. This is especially the case because the publications that we'll be producing require the construction of new variables and a close working relationship between PEAR and PEDSS. Matt and Ted are going to describe for you in detail the workflow that is involved in this area of intersection between these two solicitations. The PEAR-PEDSS Workflow MR. SOLDNER: Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon. My name is Matt Soldner. I'm going to do my best to describe what's on the screen to those of you on the phone. We will make these available hopefully in some form so you'll be able to see these shortly after this. But, as Tom mentioned, really the publication process drives the PEAR-PEDSS overlap, at least as we have currently conceived of it in this PWS for the PreSolicitation Conference. The boxes here that are in blue on the screen correspond to PEAR functions, the boxes that are red involve PEDSS functions, and those that are purple 24

23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 format. We must have publication and static tables that address their analytic needs. At present, in our Table Library, that means about 5,000 static tables. We must be able to respond to their questions about our data and support them as they use our tools, and we must be able to execute for them customized analytic projects of the very highest priority. Meeting these kinds of needs is the role that's been played by the contract now in place and will be met by the successor solicitations PEAR and PEDSS that we'll be discussing today. The key difference from the contract currently in place is that in the future, work will be divided into two vehicles, PEAR and PEDSS, and this will demand of contractors a highly coordinated workflow. Oh, there we are, great. As this first slide on the screen shows, for those of you who are listening by phone, it's a Venn diagram illustrating the relationship between those two areas of activity, PEAR and PEDSS. While some tasks are standalone activities, as the diagram shows, there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 involve both. And I will try to describe the color and the overlap as I walk through these slides. It may not be obvious even to you in the room. I'm giving the projector what color is what. (Laughter.) MR. SOLDNER: So sorry in advance. Next time I'll use better -- I also say that these boxes correspond with subtasks in the contract themselves, so you will hear these repeated as Ted, Tracy, and I talk about the subtasks for each of the two contracts. But generally, as it relates to the overlap, the publication process, as envisioned here, begins when NCES releases a slate of analysis questions we would like to see answered. The PEAR contractor will respond to that slate of contracts with a series of analysis prospectuses, and to execute that analysis prospectus, they will access our data in one of two fashions: either in the top red box, they will use our public facing tool that accesses our restricted data that is currently developed by our prior contractor and will be maintained by PEDSS; or they will use restricted data controlled by this agency, using their

26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 own statistical software. After the analysis prospectus is generated, if NCES is happy with the work, they will order a draft manuscript, which represents the work product the PEAR contractor would like us to eventually publish, and, as described in the PEAR contract, there are varying levels of review that will then ensue. We will provide feedback in review in a draft manuscript, we will forward the draft manuscript, if accepted, to our Statistical Standards Office, as a review quality manuscript, and if it's accepted by them, we will forward it again to our central agency's Standards and Review Office for a publication-quality manuscript. Those are all PEAR tasks. Here is where the overlap becomes a tad more apparent. As Tom mentioned, we are required to make available to users the data that underlies our public reports. Now, generally, these analyses rely upon variables in data we've already made available via our public tool. However, if the PEAR contractor executes an analysis that depends upon a variable not made presently available, that variable needs to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 28 PDF, which we then post to our website. Simultaneously, all tables in the publication are converted to HTML, which have been posted to our Table Library by the PEDSS contractor, which Tom will describe later. Anyone in the NCES, anything that I left off here that's critical to explain to folks? (No audible response.) MR. SOLDNER: So the upshot is this, although the analysis contractor is doing the analytic work, the PEDSS contractor must work with them to get the product of their work online because the variables used in those reports must be made public, as must the tables and contents. And so this shows the kind of currently, as envisioned, rough breakout of labor between the two. As noted in the Venn diagram earlier, there are many tasks that are idiosyncratic to PEAR and PEDSS, wholly unrelated to this. These are places where you will need to collaborate with the other contractor for the life of the contract. All right. With that, we're going to walk through the Performance Work Statements. We will start

27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 released. So, in general, as you will see on the slide, the PEAR contractor makes the variable representing the new construct. The PEDSS contractor makes that variable available. So if a publication-quality manuscript is accepted and will be released by the Center, prior to its release, the PEAR and the PEDSS contractor must work together to ensure the following steps take place. First the PEAR contractor generates the new variable. They send it to the PEDSS contractor for that variable to be posted to public facing tool. The PEDSS contractor posts it, presently to a review server. Both the PEAR and the PEDSS contractor independently conduct quality control and they fix, as needed, to ensure that the variable provided will eventually become public, matches the variable used in the analysis. When QC is complete, we move forward to electronic publishing. That is a PEAR task that we envision having two paths. First, the entire publication is released via the web, via 508-compliant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 with the PEAR contract. I will talk about the first four tasks inside PEAR, and then I'll pass it off to my colleague Tracy Hunt-White. Overview of PEAR Tasks I'm going to kind of give you the overview. Hopefully you all had occasion to review both of these before you came. Task 1 in the PEAR contract is relatively simple, it's our management task, talking about the kind of monthly reporting, schedules, and other kinds of ongoing documentation we require. However, for those of you who have not worked with us, I want to draw special attention to Subtask 1.3, Confidentiality Reports. Generally, data collected by NCES are governed by a series of laws that require the keepers of those data to maintain their Privacy and Confidentiality under penalty of law. You will be required to execute affidavits of nondisclosure or other documents, as required by the Center, as will all of your employees that have access to these systems. It is highly unlikely that in the PEAR contract Task 2 or 4 could not be done without those

29

30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 agreements in place. User public tool does not require the confidentiality statements to be signed, but we suspect work under Task 2 and 4 will require access to restricted-use data, which will require those confidentiality documents to be executed before work can begin. Task 2 is Analysis and Reporting. In the PWS, we reference three types of publication formats, and I want to show examples to you briefly. The first are web tables. This is what web tables currently look like. Web tables have a nice cover page, which describes the contents, and then any number of tables that follow. And by "any number," I mean anything from 10 pages of tables to 300 pages of tables. It simply depends upon what it is that NCES has approved for publication. The second format is known as Statistics in Brief or Trends in Brief. This is an example SIB or TIB. Typically these reports answer focused research questions. They do not exceed 20 pages in length, and have no more than 12 figures or tables. And, finally, not shown here, is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 anticipate these two rounds of feedback from Statistical Standards to ensure that document receives their approval. Assuming that happens, we move forward to Subtask 2.4, where we forward your manuscript on to our Standards and Review Office. At that point, it may or may not be sent to outside academic reviewers for their feedback. Again, we suggest that you anticipate these two rounds of feedback for 2.4. And, ideally, at that stage, if it's approved, the document moves forward to publication. Now, you will note we have two other subtasks under Task 2. The first is Subtask 2.5, which we call Response to Professional Judgment Reviews. As your materials are reviewed, there may be violations of NCES or other standards we note and send back to you for corrections. These are things that we would consider to be an error. However, because these materials are subject to external review, they often receive feedback from reviewers that are reflective of their own particular approach to answering the question. NCES 32

31 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Statistical Analysis Report. Statistical Analysis Reports are essentially long-form stats and research trends in brief that go into much more depth on one or more research questions. Generally, they do not exceed 125 pages and contain no more than 30 figures or tables. The PWS contains links to example publications you all should look at if you're interested. Under Task 2, there are six subtasks, some with sub-subtasks, but generally Subtask 2.1 describes the analysis prospectus I referenced earlier, in which contractors respond to some or all of the slate provided by NCES. Subtask 2.2, the Draft Manuscript. If NCES elects to move forward with the prospectus provided by the contractor, we will ask them to complete a draft manuscript. We will provide you up to two rounds of feedback on what you provided. Subtask 2.3, a Review Quality Manuscript. If we accept the draft manuscript and desire to move forward, we will forward your review quality manuscript to our Statistical Standards Office, and they will provide feedback to you. We suggest that you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 will not consider it wrong; however, it's something that needs to be addressed before it can be fixed. There can be any number of responses to Professional Judgment Reviews as the process moves forward. Ultimately, all must be resolved before the publication can be released. And then, finally, in Subtask 2.6, we have Prerelease Quality Control. This is what I referenced earlier in the diagram, it's kind of going back and forth between the PEAR and the PEDSS contractor. Before the first publication is released, we ask you to get us a QC plan. After that, we simply expect the results of your QC testing for each publication as new variables are added to our system. That's Subtask 2 in a nutshell. Task 3 is Publication Production. Publication Production has three subtasks, which can vary by the level of the intensity of work required: the first subtask is Editing; the second subtask is Layout and Formatting, or Desktopping; and, finally, Subtask 3.3, Electronic Publishing. The last task I want to talk about is Task 4,

34 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Ad-Hoc Analysis. Although NCES endeavors to release its entire list of questions as a slate at the start of the year, questions come up on an ad-hoc basis that NCES may not have the time or capacity to respond to. In that case, we will post questions under Task 4. Typically, the results can be provided back to us in memo or tabular form. These are generally short, although each question may have kind of unique characteristics that drive the length or complexity. These materials are often shared directly with senior leadership of the department, and, therefore, these are expected to be in professional documents ready for review at the Assistant Secretary and above level. And I will turn it over to Tracy to talk about Tasks 5, 6, and 7. MS. HUNT-WHITE: Hi. I'm Tracy Hunt-White. And the tasks that I'll be talking about are really to provide more support to our data users and to us, so it's kind of a twofold target we're trying to reach here. The first is a help desk task, for this we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 our postsecondary studies, and be familiar with our other NCES studies. You should also be able to help them to use our data tools that Ted will talk about, and also our restricted-use data files. So given that, we expect the help desk staff to know some of our major statistical programs like SAS and SPF and Stata. We want not only someone who can respond to these requests, but we also want someone who can track the responses and provide supporting documentation and disseminate them. We want to be able to make some of this available to us internally and maybe even online for our users. And we want to use this mechanism to also provide feedback about our studies, so if there is something we're learning through questions that we're getting, then we want to be able to use that to improve our studies. Maybe it might be creating a new variable or something we need to ask about in our future studies. Let's see. Quality Control This is very important to us. Of course, we don't want data to go out there wrong, so the help desk needs to have a process in place where they check the information that 36

35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 wanted to establish a help desk or a process to respond to ad-hoc requests that we get. Now, Tom told you about the number of requests that we get from our different data users, so it could from reporters, it could be from college students, it could be from faculty members, it could be from the general public. So we have a lot of users out there. And basically we're asking -- it applies to our postsecondary example of longitudinal studies that Tom mentioned, but it can also be related to other NCES studies. So perhaps it might be for other data at NCES, like the IPEDS data, or even some elementary secondary data. It just depends on what the research question is. I expect, we request, many requests per week for the help desk, and that can range from giving a simple response to, "Give us the percent of students who have financial aid," to something more complex, and we anticipate, as we stated in the PWF, that it will be about a 0.25 FTE staff position. And the help desk should be able to answer questions about our study, so you should be able to tell, I guess, requestors about our various studies, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 they provide. For more complex requests, those should be submitted to NCES prior to responding to requests, and also we might seek to see what responses are to other requests before we have you respond to them. The main tasks, subtasks, in this are maintain the help desk system by receive information requests, respond to the information requests, track the information request responses and documentation. And those are the three main tasks, subtasks, of the help desk. For Task 6, we often get requests to provide training definitely locally, and sometimes we provide it at conferences. This Task 6, Training a Conference Presentation, is the way to expand our training out to beyond just the local area. So this involves up to five -- in this PWS, we're saying up to five local, national, or regional conference, in-person conference, training. So it might be telling people more about our studies, or it might be actually hands-on training with our data tools, so learning how to use our data tools. But also having some online presence. We don't have very many tutorials and other support

37

38 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 online, so we really want to enhance that part of NCES. So we're talking webinars, web tutorials, and even possibly teleconferences to get more information to our users. So the training could cover the use of our data tools, but it also can be more information about our studies, and even some other products that we have. For instance, we really have never done anything about our restricted-use data files, so maybe that's some additional training that we want to make available to users. And, as I mentioned, we expect hands-on training, so not all of this is just formal presentations, but want something that would really be engaging to our users, not just, you know, sitting there listening to you trying to learn how to use the PowerStats tool. The contractors shall develop materials for use at these workshops and trainings that will facilitate learning and be of use to the audience members even after the workshop, so it's not just something that we can all use while in training. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 available online for users, you know, all of our presentations online to users, a way to announce these training opportunities, but just do it in a more systematic way than what's currently done, and also making outreach to appropriate organizations to announce our training, so not just something online, but also contacting associations that might be interested in what we're doing. Let's see. One thing I wanted to highlight for that, when training is being provided, we also want to get feedback on the trainings. We want to know if these things work, right? So we want the trainings to be evaluated, and we want feedback from you all about what worked, what didn't work, how we can improve the next training. So I just want to make sure I put that in there because we're always looking for feedback about what we do, we just don't want to keep on keeping on with the same stuff that doesn't work. So quality assurance. This is more support to us. Sometimes we produce tables and reports and data files that we need reviewed. We all review it here internally, but we need an extra set of eyes to 40

39 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 The subtasks for these contracts are develop and update training or conference material. Some of the materials we'll provide to you, and they'll need to be updated. Some of the materials you'll create new. Develop webinar and online training materials, and that's something, like I mentioned, we don't have a lot of that we need to put out there. Provide technical support at training. As a staff member at NCES that's giving some training, we might need support, especially if we're doing hands-on training and we have a lot of folks in the room, we'll need people to help show people how to complete -- use the data tool, for instance. Provide training and presentations. Sometimes we're going to need you to go out and provide the training and presentations. Sometimes we can't get to a certain location, sometimes you're closer, sometimes the schedule doesn't work out, so we need you to go and make the presentation for us. And to track the training and announce the training opportunities. We want some sort of systematic way of tracking all our training, making it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 also look at what we put out. So the activities range from verify estimates in our tables to helping analyze data and report, but also checking our new datasets. So when we do a data collection, we have to get the data out there, and we need to obviously check it before we do, so we need someone who would be able to do that. But it's not just about checking numbers and data, but also about providing recommendations and guidance on how to improve the table or report. If you see that some table or report could be enhanced with another variable or another row split or something like that, then provide some guidance on that. So we're asking a lot of you all here. And the contractor shall develop a process to check these products and update these processes as needed. That's the big key for us. We don't want our data to be wrong, we don't want our tables to be wrong, so there really needs to be some process in place to make sure that what we put out there is correct. We expect turnaround for these reviews, for this particular task, in like 1 to 5 days, and right

42 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 now we anticipate approximately 20 analyses pertaining to tables and reports over the life of the contract and 10 analyses pertaining to our data files, because we have a couple of data collections coming up that we'll need to get the data out. For the review of the tables and reports, so it would things like replicating the SMS (ph), verifying the logic and assumptions, and then reviewing them to see if they meet our NCES standards. And several things, like ease of comprehension. Does this table make sense? Can people read it easily? For our review of data files and data tools, we're looking for completeness and technical accuracy, and again ease of use. Can people find the variables that they're looking for with our datasets? With the data files, it can be anything from reviewing a complete whole new data file that we've just created to reviewing a few variables of a data file that we've already released. So it can really be a very broad activity. And with that, I will turn it over to Ted. Overview of PEDSS Tasks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Task 3 is QuickStats. It's also an existing online tool that allows users to build simple statistical tables on large sample survey datasets, and to do that quickly. It is designed to allow the public access to restricted-use data, just like PowerStats, while maintaining the confidentiality of the individual data. It includes a subset of the tools that are available through PowerStats. And you'll see this screen here, we see where the user is able to select what they want to perform within PowerStats. Either you want to build a table, run a regression, look up tables that are stored offline somewhere and also the recent work that was completed by the user. Now, QuickStats is a subset of these. Here we have it. So QuickStats allows users to build simple tables and to do that quickly, so it's usually a subset of variables that have been created from restricted-use datasets, from our sample survey data collections, and to use those variables in a way to produce a simple two-way table that takes categorical and continuous variables and runs the results in either tabular format 44

43 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 MR. SOCHA: Thank you, Tracy. My name is Ted Socha. I will be speaking today about the Postsecondary Education Data Structure Support Contract, PEDSS. The role of PEDSS is to support and develop our custom-built web piece statistical software products and databases. The scope of the contract tasks relate to the following four domains: management of the contract, maintenance of existing tools, development of new modules and tools, and documentation of the work that's performed. I will go through the individual tasks, and they are as follows: One is Task 1, it's outlined in the PWS, and that's just management of the contract. Sorry if you guys can't hear me back there, I'll speak up. Task 2 is Maintenance of PowerStats. PowerStats is our existing online tool which allows registered users to build complex statistical tables and run basic regressions on a large sample survey datasets. It is designed to allow the public access to restricted-use data while maintaining confidentiality of the individual data. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 or graphical format. The Tables Library -- Matt and Tom talked about this earlier -- the Tables Library is where we store all the tables that have been created for our publications, our electronic publications and also for the Postsecondary Division at least. It takes the specifications that have been developed using PowerStats or QuickStats and also stores the HTML of the output that the PEAR contract has developed for use in publications. So it's where users can go, the public can go, and pull up the tables that were created under PEAR and also use those tables and import them back into PowerStats and QuickStats, two of the tasks that I just spoke of, and either edit or redisplay or get additional information about those tables that weren't displayed in the publication table itself. So this is also something that's existing in our online portal. Something new is TrendStats. We want to take what we learn from PowerStats and be able to produce statistics, the same statistics, over different data collections over time. So right now you could pull up PowerStats, and you could run a two-way table for a

46 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 particular point of data in time. If we're collecting the information over time through different data collections, TrendStats would allow us to take the common variables and produce aggregated statistics for those different data collection points in time. And the PWS explains briefly how that would operate and how we see that going forward. WebVTS is an existing tool also. It's a central repository of our postsecondary sample survey data and metadata. It's the backend system from which PowerStats, QuickStats, and our restricted-use datasets are created. The restricted-use datasets are the datasets that are provided by our data collection contractors, so this isn't something that would be done under PEAR. We have other contractors that support our existing data collections that produce large datasets and then provide them to us so that we could redistribute that in the form of PowerStats, QuickStats, and in the future, TrendStats datasets through our online portal. It features a web GUI that allows NCES and its authorized contractors to upload data and define 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 48 perspective. Task 9 is the Publication of Data Structures. And that's relating to the pushing of NCES-approved DataLab and WebVTS files from the review server, on the contractor's server, to NCES's development servers. Those servers act as an intermediary between what's live on the web and the contractor's review server, so that would could do internal control testing there. The contractor shall quality-check both the review, the development review, and also the live servers, for accuracy and to make sure that estimates produced in each one of those environments are consistent. In addition to that, contractor is expected to comply with all IES Web Publishing Guidelines, Standards and Procedures, and once the development server quality- checking is complete, the contractor will inform us and the IT department of its availability to move to the production server, which is our live server. And the final task is Documentation. In accordance with our Web Publishing Guidelines, the

47 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 the metadata to be overlaid. Task 7 is the backup of data. The contractor shall maintain a copy of all DataLab -- DataLab is our suite of public tools -- the suite of public tools again is PowerStats, QuickStats, and the Tables Library, and also WebVTS, on a non-NCES server. The server/web environment shall comply with NIST-moderate security standards. This server shall act as a review environment from which NCES will monitor the contractor's progress on current projects and approve proposed upgrades/changes to be moved to NCES' servers. Task 8 is Quality Assurance. We briefly spoke about quality assurance earlier with our explanation of PEAR, but quality assurance in this respect is going through and making sure that what the online tools, statistical tools, are providing users match what we expect and what we expected to provide them, and also making sure that the estimates which it produces also match up to our published tables. So there is a bit of overlap there with PEAR, but it's much more detailed from a technical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 contractor must document the work that is completed for the rest of the contract, and that will be made available to us annually for our review and to make sure that everything is being documented appropriately and fully. There are two options listed after the tasks. The first option is to derive WebVTS-compliant -- so WebVTS was that backend system that controls the data that our public interfaces run off of -- and on an-hoc basis, we would ask the contractor to derive WebVTScompliant datasets from external data sources. So if we start a new initiative somewhere else and we had this data that wasn't necessarily in the format that QuickStats and PowerStats run off of, we could exercise the option to have the contractor get it in that compliant format and to move that data and push it live on our servers and all the steps in between obviously. Option 2 is on an ad-hoc basis, the contractor shall develop or provide in-person and/or online training to external audiences on the abovementioned data products. So this could be a web conference, this could be going in person and providing

50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 training on our data products, but this could also be training provided in-house to NCES employees, Department of Education employees. So thank you for your time. Now the questions. Questions MS. JOHNSON: All right. So we heard -thank you for the overview. Now we will get to the questions. Now, my understanding is that you all received questions from the contractors. At this particular time what we're going to do is we're getting the questions in writing, and it's going to be published with the solicitation. Now, does anybody have any questions on their cards? MALE SPEAKER: I have two small ones here. MS. JOHNSON: Do we want to have them just stand up and state their question? MALE SPEAKER: Sure. Yeah. Yeah. MS. JOHNSON: Whenever you stand up, state your question, give your name and your company's name just so we can make sure that our recorder gets it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 52 MR. KUAI: All right. So I just state a question. MR. FRANKEL: Yeah. Yeah. It's important that we clarify that. Thank you. MR. KUAI: All right. All right. Okay. For the tools, PowerStats and QuickStats -MALE SPEAKER: What was the previous question that you asked? MR. FRANKEL: Oh, I'm sorry. MR. KUAI: The previous question is -- my question was WebVTS, whether this is a -- it's a backend tool that has web interface, so this is more like an admin tool for the people to use. That's my question, whether that is true or not. The second question is the PowerStats and then QuickStats, what tools are they viewed on? Is that like they're viewed on a third-party tool or is that a custom-view tools? And if it's custom-view tool, which platform that was viewed on and which languages you used, which proven languages you use to view on? Another question is how soon you're going to

And the answers will be delivered with the solicitation. MALE SPEAKER: Why don't we give you the cards, in that case, and we will -MALE SPEAKER: This way everybody gets to hear the question. MALE SPEAKER: Oh, okay. MALE SPEAKER: In addition to the questions you submitted already, which will also be -- the answers will be disseminated at the same time. MALE SPEAKER: Okay. MR. KUAI: Wenming Kuai, from GBTI. A question about WebVTS. So you mentioned that is backend tool, but it also has web interface, right? This is more like an admin tool for the contractors and then the project people to use to approve data and then to create a report and then write (inaudible) use. Is that -MR. FRANKEL: We'll provide written answers. Yes, we should now respond. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 release this solicitation. (Laughter.) MR. KUAI: And when we expect this to be awarded? Is that going to be before the end of this year? MS. JOHNSON: We expect the contract award prior to September 30th. MR. KUAI: All right. Okay. Yeah. We know that everybody is going to be really, really busy. (Laughter.) MR. KUAI: All right. That's for now. (Laughter.) MR. SOCHA: Thank you. MS. JOHNSON: Who is next? MR. TAYLOR: Again, Keith Taylor, from 2ndWave. I think I heard that there is an existing contract that's being split into two separate contracts, so I was just curious as to the rationale behind that. That's the first question. And the second one is: Who is the incumbent on the existing contract? MS. JOHNSON: The current contract is held by

WEST: I'm Jerry West, from Mathematica. You mentioned that the PEDSS was a small business setaside? MS. JOHNSON: Yes. MR. WEST: That decision has been made, right? MS. JOHNSON: Yes. MR. WEST: Is the decision then for PEAR to be an open competition or something other than a small business set-aside? MS. JOHNSON: Okay, as of now, we have not determined that to be a small business set-aside, but as you know, with market research, depending on what that turns up at that particular time, the contracting officer will make the determination if it's a small business set-aside, but as of now, it is open. MALE SPEAKER: Hi. I'm on the phone. I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 MR. SAKR: Okay. Ted mentioned about the NIST security level, which there are separate levels over there. Are you talking about moderate or what? The second question is: When the data comes to the VTS, brought over to the VTS, in what format does it come from RTI (ph) in the contract? The third question on that, on the same subject, the data that comes to the VTS, does it go through a -- does the data go through a QC process? I mean, I know that lots is -- but does it go through a QC, a new QC process, or the contractor of the one VTS has to do that? Who's got to do the QC from the time it comes from the collection contractor to the time that it is in the VTS? MR. SOCHA: Do those questions need to be repeated for the phone? FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes. (Laughter.) MR. SAKR: Oh, I said something different than I wrote. (Laughter.) MR. SOCHA: Question one was NIST security 56

55 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 a quick question. Could you repeat the questions that the audience members are asking? Because it's kind of hard to hear folks on the phone. We can hear you, you answer very clearly, but the questions are kind of difficult to hear. MS. JOHNSON: Okay. Yeah. I believe he's writing them on the note card, and whenever we get them written out, I'll repeat them. So let me see, did you hear the last question that was asked? FEMALE SPEAKER: No. MS. JOHNSON: Okay. MALE SPEAKER: No. MS. JOHNSON: The last question that was asked -MALE SPEAKER: No, I didn't ask yet. MS. JOHNSON: Oh, you didn't go yet. It was by Keith Taylor, from 2ndWave. He asked: Who is the incumbent? That's the first question. The second question: Why is the existing contract being split into two separate contracts? All right. Another question that we have -do you want to read it? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 level? MS. JOHNSON: Which level of -MR. SOCHA: NIST security level. MS. JOHNSON: And then the second question is: What format does the data come in when loaded into WebVTS? MR. SOCHA: The third question was about -MR. SAKR: The third was about -MR. SOCHA: Quality assurance. MR. SAKR: -- quality assurance. MR. SOCHA: So as data comes in from the data collection contractors or other contractors into WebVTS, who is responsible and at what level is that quality-checking going on? MALE SPEAKER: Right. MS. JOHNSON: And let me repeat the first set of questions. The first question that you heard was WebVTS is a web-based administration tool for backend functions. Please confirm. Question number two: When will the solicitation be released? And I answered that question.

58 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 When will the contract be expected to be awarded? Question three: Are the tools developed third- party, a COTS tool, or custom-developed? Number four: If custom-built, which platform is it developed on and which programming languages are used? Okay, we have another question: Is PEDSS a small business set-aside? Yes. What about the PEAR? Is it full and open? And I answered that question. Are there any more questions on cards? FEMALE SPEAKER: Given the number of information requests that can occur on a weekly or a monthly basis under the PEAR contract, I wondering if there will be priorities for doing those analyses. For example, will a student's set of questions for analyses, because they were the first request, take precedence over, for example, questions from university researchers or -MR. WEKO: Or the White House. Yeah, we'll answer that. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 60 MR. WEKO: Okay. Oh, you asked another question, and that was: Is there an expectation that the contractor will have direct contact with external sources, like news reporters, or would that be instead handled by the National Center for Education Statistics? Thank you, helpful clarifying question. MALE SPEAKER: What was her name, for the record? MR. WEKO: Your name? MS. BRAUEN: Oh, Marsha Brauen, from Westat. MS. JOHNSON: Are there any other questions? MS. HOM: Fortune IT Services. My first question is: What level of tech support that we expecting? Like 8:00 to 5:00, 9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday or go beyond that? MALE SPEAKER: The tech support for the PEDSS for us? MS. HOM: The company will provide the services support Department of Education. MALE SPEAKER: Gotcha. Yeah. Okay. MS. HOM: Is that Monday through Friday 8:00 to 5:00, or 9:00 to 5:00?

Also, is it the understanding that the contractor will deal directly with reporters or what will the process be for the -MS. BRAUEN: I'm sorry, I can't hear what's going on. MR. WEKO: There were two questions just asked. One is about setting priority among user requests because they come from a variety of different sources. What will be the priorities for information requests? Will it be done on a "first come, first served" basis? If not, what system of priorities will be established? Did you hear that? MS. BRAUEN: Yes, thank you. MR. WEKO: Okay. And the second question, which is not actually -MS. JOHNSON: I don't think he actually asked a second question. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 MS. JOHNSON: The question on the conference line is: What level of support is going to be required for the help desk? Is it going to be Monday through Friday 9:00 to 5:00? Am I summarizing the question well? MR. SOCHA: Yeah. Point of clarification. The help desk, it's not the help desk task that's in the PEAR. She's referring to supporting us here as contracting officers, contract representatives, in working with the PEDSS contract and what hours of operation we expect you to be available to support us. MS. HOM: So just the normal like Monday through Friday 8:00, 9:00 to 5:00. MR. SOCHA: For example, Monday through Friday 9:00 to 5:00. MS. HOM: Okay. And my second question: What is the current staffing and the budget? We're a small business, we have some idea what is the staffing required. MR. SOCHA: So the question was: What's the current staffing and budget? And I will defer to -MS. JOHNSON: Whenever the solicitation is

62 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 released, at that particular time, there may be level of effort provided to give you an idea of estimated hours. Also, based on this particular Pre-Solicitation Conference, there may actually be some changes to the draft Performance Work Statement, so some of these things may be clarified within that. So hopefully during the solicitation process, you might get some answers to that. MS. HOM: Okay. MS. JOHNSON: But at this particular point in time, we don't have that particular information on hand. MS. HOM: All right. And my third question is: Under the Task 10, we would like to know, what is the full program documentation you expect? It would be nice to provide a list of things you expect, and that will be helpful for us, if you can. MS. JOHNSON: Thank you. MR. SOCHA: And the question was: What is the full documentation detail -- what are the requirements for that in respect to what was outlined for Task 10? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 now. Did I answer your question? FEMALE SPEAKER: Uh-huh. MR. GLASS: J.R. Glass, QSSI. Is hosting of the website portal part of the PEDSS contract? It doesn't appear that it would be, but if not, could you please describe the interaction between the vendor that's responsible for hosting of actual portal and website and the PEDSS contract? MR. SOCHA: So the question was: Is hosting of the website that supports the PEDSS contract part of the contract or not? MR. GLASS: And can you describe the interaction, if it's not, with the contractor who is responsible? MR. SOCHA: Okay. And if it's not part of the contract, describe the interaction between who is hosting and the contractor for PEDSS. MS. JOHNSON: Additional questions from the floor or the conference line? MS. BRUNSON: When will the responses to the questions be posted? Because I'm having a problem 64

63 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 which is documentation? MS. JOHNSON: Are there any more questions? MR. PETERSON: Ron Peterson, with CC Pace. Will the software development that's involved in the tasks for PEDSS be done at the government site or the contractor's site? MR. SOCHA: The question was: On the PEDSS contract, will the software development be completed on the contractor's servers or the Department -MR. PETERSON: Contractor's site. MR. SOCHA: Contractor's site or the government's site? FEMALE SPEAKER: Early on, you mentioned that before you decide on the vehicle for the PEAR, that you will be conducting market research, and I'm wondering what you meant by that. MS. JOHNSON: Well, all of this is market research, marketing communications, asking for your questions and your comments on the statement of work, you all being here today seeing who's in the field, who does this particular type of work. This is all part of acquisition planning. So that's what we're doing right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

65 hearing all of the responses. Will they be posted somewhere? MS. JOHNSON: Yes. They will be posted on FedBizOpps. MALE SPEAKER: Did you hear that? MS. JOHNSON: Along with the transcripts and everything that's going on today, a verbatim copy will be posted on FedBizOpps, the same place where you found out about this Pre-Solicitation Conference. MS. BRUNSON: Thank you. MS. JOHNSON: Could you please state your name and company? MS. BRUNSON: Yes. My name is Lucinda Brunson. Louis Call's Complete Computer Solutions. MR. KUAI: GBTI again. A few questions. One is the help desk. The Department of Education has a help desk, I suppose, right? So what's the relationship between this help desk and the Department of Education help desk? Is the Department of Education is a third-tier support and then this here provides second and third-tier support? That's the question. MR. SOCHA: And just for clarification, the

(866) 448 - DEPO www.CapitalReportingCompany.com Š 2012

Capital Reporting Company Pre-Solicitation Conference for PEAR and PEDSS 05-14-2012
66 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 question was: What's the prioritization of support -MR. KUAI: What's the relationship -MR. SOCHA: What's the relationship between this help desk and help desks? And are you speaking about the PEAR contract? MR. KUAI: I'm speaking about the PEAR contract, yeah, because it has something -MR. SOCHA: Yeah, okay. Good. MR. KUAI: Yeah. It has a help desk in it, so I wanted to make sure what's the relationship between the two, and then, you know, whether it provide third or second or third-tier support. So the second question is that before the data get published, it's actually put on a reviewer's server. So the reviewer's server, I suppose, is going to be provided by the PEAR's contractor. That's my assumption. Now, what about PEDSS contractor? Will the PEDSS contractor also provide a reviewer's server in addition to the development server? So the data is going to be pushed from the reviewer's server to the development server. So I suppose that the PEDSS contractor will just take care 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 (Laughter.) MR. SOCHA: So Tables Library, yes, it's a look-up database. And it doesn't perform any additional functions than what's already programmed in. MR. KUAI: Right. That was my understanding, but I'm just trying to clarify. Yeah. Okay. For the training for the PEDSS side of it, how many users need to be trained? What type of users need to be trained? And are these users including the system administrators from Department of Education? MR. SOCHA: And the final question was: How many users would need training? And that relates to the second option, I believe, in the PEDSS. MR. WEKO: So how many users of what type of training. MR. KUAI: Right. And then you talk about there could be face-to-face training. That means the locations are very important. How many locations do we have to perform, to provide the training? MR. KOPAN: Marty Kopan, with Technik, Incorporated. Just a quick question. Will a list of the participants in the Pre-Solicitation Conference be 68

67 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 of the development server, not the reviewer's server. So please clarify. And the third one is the PEDSS contract talk about backup of data. So where the data will be backed up to? Will that be backed up to a server provided by the Department of Education or it's going to be provided by the contractor? The next one is DataLab. The DataLab talk about it's a suite of tools, but you also mention that the Tables Library is also part of the DataLab. But my understanding is that the Tables Library is not a tool, it's data, right? So it is not part of the DataLab? Or maybe it's just a data tier for the DataLab. MR. SOCHA: Perhaps I can clarify that now. Is that okay? MALE SPEAKER: Yeah. MR. SOCHA: So the DataLab is just a term that we use that incorporates all of our publicly facing tools. MR. KUAI: All right. Fine. MALE SPEAKER: It has nothing to do with Google lab. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

69 made available? MS. JOHNSON: Yes. MALE SPEAKER: Everything that's happening here will be made available at the same spot on FedBizOpps. MR. KOPAN: Do you have an idea of when they'll be available? MS. JOHNSON: Well, it's going to take a few days to get all this together, but definitely we will post it in a timely manner. So just please continue to look on FedBizOpps for updates and postings. MR. KOPAN: Okay, thank you. MR. KEARSLEY: Steven Kearsley with Composite Apps. We seem to be in a new era of data management, and with Obama's big data initiative, getting this data out to the public and the end consumer. Could you talk just a little bit about getting new ideas on public outreach? What are your biggest challenges or your biggest user community, and if you have any plans to socialize the statistics in a way that goes beyond the current website? If you had just a few minutes to talk right now, that would be great, just if there is

KEARSLEY: Okay. MALE SPEAKER: Yeah. Good question. MS. BRAUEN: I have one more. Marsha Brauen, from Westat. Depending on the contract vehicle that you end up deciding will be used for the PEAR, might there be a statement of capabilities that we would be requested to respond to? MS. JOHNSON: We asked for corporate capabilities this time, so we'll be using that. I mean, if we decide to go requesting any more further information, preliminary information, we'll ask for that, but that was the whole point, because a lot of times what we do, if you notice, many of you who have done business with the Department of Education and have seen our postings, a lot of times we just ask for the request for information, and a lot of times we don't hold a lot of pre-solicitation conferences, but part of our communication plan is more collaboration and more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 something that would be available, or would you encourage them to find a partner? Say, for instance, if a small company had higher education subject matter expertise and data management tools I wanted to partner with somebody? (Laughter.) MS. JOHNSON: There are two separate contracts. There will be a prime for each of those contracts. There is a prime contractor, somebody that's responsible doing the majority of the work, a certain percentage, but what we do encourage is we do encourage teaming. We encourage you to have subcontractors. That's why you have subcontractors and consultants, if there are pieces, technical pieces, that you might not have the expertise in, so we just ask that you -- you know, that's what this is for, to leverage your opportunities that you have and to collaborate and to partner and to team, but ultimately the prime contractor is responsible for carrying out the contract requirements. MR. PARISH: So it sounds like you would not be open to just picking out a part of that. 72

71 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 outreach with the public. So we're just trying to marry all of these together and get as much information as we can. So we do have each company's corporate capability statement, and we're looking at that. So, again, be on the look out on FedBizOpps if there is any other information requested. MR. PARISH: Hi. Brian Parish, IData. Two questions. In terms of the support -- I guess it's on the PEAR -- most of the questions you get from the help desk, are they related to using the tools or using the data, like data-specific questions, or are they more like analysis kind of questions, like, you know, affect the resources? And then on the PEDSS one, in terms of new features or new tools or enhancements, is everything basically enhancements to the existing set of customdeveloped applications that you have, or would you be open to new or existing technologies rather than enhancing the existing base? And then, lastly, hypothetically, if there are components of either proposal that a vendor wants to bid, but not the whole, is that going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 MS. JOHNSON: Would you say that again? MR. PARISH: That you would not be open to someone replying to only a portion of the -MS. JOHNSON: Only if -- no, no, not a portion. You have to take that responsibility, that subcontractor -- let's say, for instance, you can only do a portion, what I encourage you to do is to team with somebody, to partner, find you some subcontractors, some consultants who have that base. MR. PARISH: I'm aware of that. Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, if I may. So can you say a word about this small business set-aside and what that means? I understand it from a state level, but a federal level, what the rules are on that. MS. JOHNSON: Could we have our small business specialist? MR. WEKO: Helen or Marcella? MS. JOHNSON: Marcella? MR. WEKO: Or Helen, either one. MR. PARISH: Could you speak for a minute on what the small business set-aside, what the rules are on that?

For those of you on the phone, just to repeat, there have been four questions now. One has to do with the user support, is the user support chiefly about using the tools themselves, using the data, and how much statistical advice is being provided? So some clarification there. The second question was around, are you describing enhancement to existing tools or the development of new tools, with new technologies? The third question was about whether someone could bid part of the contract or has to bid whole in collaboration with partners? That was answered in the affirmative to the second half of that bid whole in collaboration with partners. And now the question is: Could you describe briefly how the small business procedures work? MS. JOHNSON: Small business set aside. MR. WEKO: Small business set aside. MS. CHANG: Hi. I'm Helen Chang. I'm in the contracts office, and I'm a small business liaison. Part 19 in FAR describes all the socioeconomic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 it was also stated in the draft statement of work as well, the performance work statement. Any questions from the floor or the conference call line? (No audible response.) MS. JOHNSON: Going once, going twice -MALE SPEAKER: Done! Dismissal MS. JOHNSON: Well, we thank you so much for attending this conference, and we would just encourage you to meet some of your colleagues in the room. Have a great day. Thank you. (Whereupon, at 2:27 p.m., the PreSolicitation Conference was concluded.) 76

75 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 programs, both that have been passed by law and how we're implementing them as contractors. Part 19 says if a contracting officer has expectation that two or more small businesses can do a procurement, they must set it aside for small business. So the rules on small business on found in Part 19, and our contracting officer, Deila, believes that two or more can do the PEDSS, and therefore she has made an initial decision to set it aside, and will at this point in time only be honoring proposals from a small business. MALE SPEAKER: What was your name again? MS. CHANG: Helen Chang. MS. JOHNSON: Are there any more questions from the floor or the conference call line? MALE SPEAKER: "Small" is defined by a NAICS Code. MS. JOHNSON: Right. And also on the presolicitation announcement that you received, there was a NAICS Code that was associated with each procurement. So based on that, your company may be a small business based on that NAICS Code, or it may not be, so make sure you look at the announcement again.
