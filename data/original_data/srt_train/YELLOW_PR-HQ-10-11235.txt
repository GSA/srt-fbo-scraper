   (a) Facilities capital cost of money will be an allowable cost under the contemplated contract, if the criteria for allowability in FAR
31.205-10(b) are met. One of the allowability criteria requires the prospective Contractor to propose facilities capital cost of money in its

   (b) If the prospective Contractor does not propose this cost, the resulting contract will include the clause Waiver of Facilities Capital
Cost of Money.

L.2   TYPE OF CONTRACT (FAR 52.216-1) (APR 1984) DEVIATION

L.3   SERVICE OF PROTEST (FAR 52.233-2) (SEP 2006)

  (a) Protests, as defined in Section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any
protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by
obtaining written and dated acknowledgement of receipt from:

  (b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.


L.4   IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME (FAR 52.237-10) (OCT 1997)

  (a) Definitions.  As used in the provision--

  Uncompensated overtime means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge
employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be
included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.

  Uncompensated overtime rate is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the
proposed hours per week.  For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated
overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 x40 divided by 45=$17.78).

  (b) For any proposed hours against which an uncompensated overtime rate is applied, the offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in
excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by labor category at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime
rate per hour, whether at the prime or subcontract level.  This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for
personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct.

  (c) The offeror’s accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting practices used to
accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours.

  (d) Proposals that include unrealistically low labor rates, or that do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a risk
assessment and will be evaluaterd for award in accordance with that assessment.

  (e) The offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime with its proposal.

subcontractor) may have a potential organizational conflict of
interest.

  (b) Prospective Contractors should refer to FAR Subpart 9.5 and
EPAAR Part 1509 for policies and procedures for avoiding,
neutralizing, or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest.

  (c) If the Contracting Officer determines that a potential
conflict exists, the prospective Contractor shall not receive an
award unless the conflict can be avoided or otherwise resolved
through the inclusion of a special contract clause or other
appropriate means.  The terms of any special clause are subject
to negotiation.

L.7   PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (EPAAR 1552.215-75) (OCT 2000)

   (a) Offerors shall submit the information requested below as part of their proposal for both the offeror and any proposed subcontractors for
subcontracts expected to exceed $1,000,000. The information may be submitted prior to other parts of the proposal in order to assist the
Government in reducing the evaluation period.

   (b) Offerors shall submit a list of all or at least five (5) contracts and subcontracts completed in the last three (3) years, and all
contracts and subcontracts currently in process, which are similar in nature to this requirement.

following information for each contract and subcontract listed:


         (a) Name of contracting activity.
         (b) Contract number.
         (c) Contract title.

      (1) Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and corrective actions taken on the identified contracts and subcontracts.

      (2) References that may be contacted by the Government include the contracting officer, program manager/project officer, or the
administrative contracting officer identified above.

      (3) If no response is received from a reference, the Government will make an attempt to contact another reference identified by the
offeror, to contact a reference not identified by the offeror, or to complete the evaluation with those references who responded. The Government
shall consider the information provided by the references, and may also consider information obtained from other sources, when evaluating an
offeror's past performance.

      (4) Attempts to obtain responses from references will generally not go beyond two telephonic messages and/or written requests from the
Government, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. The Government is not obligated to contact all of the references identified by the
offeror.

   (d) If negative feedback is received from an offeror's reference, the Government will compare the negative response to the responses from the
offeror's other references to note differences. A score will be assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The offeror will
be given the opportunity to address adverse past performance information obtained from references on which the offeror has not had a previous
opportunity to comment, if that information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include the offeror in or exclude the offeror
from the competitive range. Any past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed with offerors in the competitive range
during discussions.

   (e) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (see Attachment 5 of the solicitation for a sample) to each reference listed in their
proposal to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation.  Offerors are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever
possible (i.e., if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may
send Client Authorization Letters electronically to references with copies forwarded to the contracting officer.

      (1) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an offeror must affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past
performance history.

      (2) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or E-mailed to individual references no later than five (5) working days after proposal
submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with mailing to
references.

and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other
Government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications.

      (1) Identify the segment of the company (one division or the entire company) which received the award or certification.

      (2) Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence that the
qualifications still apply.

   (g) Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor for award.  The Past
Performance Questionnaire identified in section J will be used to collect information on an offeror's performance under existing and prior
contracts/subcontracts for products or services similar in scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to evaluate
offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation factor set forth in section M. References other than those identified by the offeror
may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.

   (h) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file.

   (i) In accordance with FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv), offerors with no relevant past performance history, or for whom information on past
performance is not available, will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably on past performance.

other than authorized EPA employees without the prior written approval of the Assistant General Counsel responsible for information law matters;
and shall return all copies of proposals, as well as any abstracts, to the Government upon completion of the audit.  The non-Government auditor

chargeable man-hours for these personnel.  If this type of effort is normally included in your indirect cost allocations, no estimate is
required.  However, direct charging of indirect costs on any resulting contract will not be allowed.  Additionally, the hours below are the
workable hours required by the Government and do not include release time (i.e., holiday, vacation, etc.).

  (b) Distribution of level of effort.  Submit your proposal utilizing the labor categories and distribution of the level of effort specified
below:

                   Period               Level of Effort


                 Base Period            13,377 hours
                 Option Period I        13,377 hours
                 Option Period II       6,689 hours


  (c) When identifying individuals assigned to the project, specify in which of the above categories the identified individual belongs. If your
company proposes an average rate for a company classification, identify the professional or technical level within which each company category
falls.

  (d) You should also submit Standard Forms 1411 for each of the following:

      1) A summary proposal for the total contract period

      2) For each contract period:
         i) a Summary Proposal
        ii) a Proposal for the basic quantity
       iii) a Proposal of 13,377 hours for Option Period I, and 6,689 hours for Option Period II.
        iv) a Proposal for the optional quantities; 13,380 hours for Base Period, 13,380 hours for Option Period I, and 6,690 hours for Option
           Period II.

L.11  PROCEDURES FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE EPA MENTOR-PROTEGE PROGRAM (EPAAR 1552.219-71) (OCT 2000)

   (a) This provision sets forth the procedures for participation in the EPA Mentor-Protege Program (hereafter referred to as the Program). The
purpose of the Program is to increase the participation of concerns owned and/or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals as subcontractors, suppliers, and ultimately as prime contractors; to establish a mutually beneficial relationship between these
concerns and EPA's large business prime contractors (although small businesses may participate as Mentors); to develop the technical and
corporate administrative expertise of these concerns, which will ultimately lead to greater success in competition for contract opportunities;
to promote the economic stability of these concerns; and to aid in the achievement of goals for the use of these concerns in subcontracting
activities under EPA contracts. If the successful offeror is accepted into the Program they shall serve as a Mentor to a Protege firm(s),
providing developmental assistance in accordance with an agreement with the Protege firm(s).

   (b) To participate as a Mentor, the offeror must receive approval in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.

   (c) A Protege must be a concern owned and/or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals within the meaning of section
8(a)(5) and (6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 673(a)(5) and (6)), including historically black colleges and universities. Further, in
accordance with Public Law 102-389 (the 1993 Appropriation Act), for EPA's contracting purposes, economically and socially disadvantaged
individuals shall be deemed to include women.

   (d) Where there may be a concern regarding the Protege firm's eligibility to participate in the program, the protege's eligibility will be
determined by the contracting officer after the SBA has completed any formal determinations.

   (e) The offeror shall submit an application in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section as part of its proposal which shall include as a
minimum the following information.

      (1) A statement and supporting documentation that the offeror is currently performing under at least one active Federal contract with an
approved subcontracting plan and is eligible for the award of Federal contracts;

      (2) A summary of the offeror's historical and recent activities and accomplishments under any disadvantaged subcontracting programs.  The
offeror is encouraged to include any initiatives or outreach information believed pertinent to approval as a Mentor firm;

      (3) The total dollar amount (including the value of all option periods or quantities) of EPA contracts and subcontracts received by the
offeror during its two preceding fiscal years. (Show prime contracts and subcontracts separately per year);

      (4) The total dollar amount and percentage of subcontract awards made to all concerns owned and/or controlled by disadvantaged individuals
under EPA contracts during its two preceding fiscal years. If recently required to submit a SF 295, provide copies of the two preceding year's
reports;


      (5) The number and total dollar amount of subcontract awards made to the identified Protege firm(s) during the two preceding fiscal years
(if any).

   (f) In addition to the information required by paragraph (e) of this section, the offeror shall submit as a part of the application the
following information for each proposed Mentor-Protege relationship:

      (1) Information on the offeror's ability to provide developmental assistance to the identified Protege firm and how the assistance will
potentially increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for the Protege firm.

      (2) A letter of intent indicating that both the Mentor firm and the Protege firm intend to enter into a contractual relationship under
which the Protege will perform as a subcontractor under the contract resulting from this solicitation and that the firms will negotiate a Mentor-
Protege agreement. The letter of intent must be signed by both parties and contain the following information:

         (i) The name, address and phone number of both parties;

         (ii) The Protege firm's business classification, based upon the NAICS code(s) which represents the contemplated supplies or services to
be provided by the Protege firm to the Mentor firm;

         (iii) A statement that the Protege firm meets the eligibility criteria;

         (iv) A preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the Protege firm and the proposed developmental assistance the Mentor firm
envisions providing the Protege. The offeror shall address those needs and how their assistance will enhance the Protege. The offeror shall
develop a schedule to assess the needs of the Protege and establish criteria to evaluate the success in the Program;

         (v) A statement that if the offeror or Protege firm is suspended or debarred while performing under an approved Mentor-Protege agreement
the offeror shall promptly give notice of the suspension or debarment to the EPA Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) and
the contracting officer. The statement shall require the Protege firm to notify the Contractor if it is suspended or debarred.

   (g) The application will be evaluated on the extent to which the offeror's proposal addresses the items listed in paragraphs (e) and (f) of
this section. To the maximum extent possible, the application should be limited to not more than 10 single pages, double spaced.  The offeror
may identify more than one Protege in its application.

   (h) If the offeror is determined to be in the competitive range, or is awarded a contract without discussions, the offeror will be advised by
the contracting officer whether their application is approved or rejected. The contracting officer, if necessary, may request additional
information in connection with the offeror's submission of its revised or best and final offer. If the successful offeror has submitted an
approved application, they shall comply with the clause titled “Mentor-Protege Program.”

   (i) Subcontracts of $1,000,000 or less awarded to firms approved as Proteges under the Program are exempt from the requirements for
competition set forth in FAR 44.202-2(a)(5), and 52.244-5(b).  However, price reasonableness must still be determined and the requirements in
FAR 44.202-2(a)(8) for cost and price analysis continue to apply.

    (j) Costs incurred by the offeror in fulfilling their agreement(s) with a Protege firm(s) are not reimbursable as a direct cost under the
contract. Unless EPA is the responsible audit agency under FAR 42.703-1, offerors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their
responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining indirect cost rates. Where EPA is the responsible audit agency, these
costs will be considered in
determining indirect cost rates.

L.15  ADDITIONAL BID/PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS (EP-S 99-2) (AUG 2004)

   a. General Instructions

           These instructions are in addition to the applicable requirements and clauses set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation
      regarding bid/proposal submission and late bids/proposals.   Please note that there are distinct addresses designated for bid/proposal
      submission on the SF 33.  Block 7 designates the location specified for delivery of hand carried/courier/overnight delivery service
      bids/proposals while Block 8 indicates the address specified for receipt of bids/proposals sent by U.S. Mail.  Bidders/Offerors are
      responsible for ensuring that their bids/proposals (and any amendments, modifications, withdrawals, or revisions thereto) are submitted so
      as to reach the Government office designated on the SF 33 prior to the designated date and time established for receipt.  Bidders and
      offerors are also responsible for allowing sufficient time for the bid/proposal to be processed through EPA’s internal mail distribution
      system described below so as to reach the designated location for bid/proposal receipt on time.  Failure to timely deliver a bid/proposal
      to the EPA Bid & Proposal Room on the 6th floor of the Ronald Reagan Building, which is the location designated for bid/proposal receipt in
      blocks 7 and 8 of the SF 33,  will render the bid/proposal “late” in accordance with FAR 14.304 and/or 15.208 and disposition of the
      bid/proposal will be handled in accordance with FAR 14.304 and 52.214-7 for bids and FAR 15.208 and 52.215-1 for proposals.
      Bidders/Offerors are cautioned that receipt of a bid/proposal by the Agency’s mail room or other central receiving facility does not
      constitute receipt by the office designated in the solicitation/invitation for bids.

   b. U.S. Mail Delivery-SF 33 Block 8

           Block 8 on the SF 33 indicates that bids/proposals sent by U.S. Mail must be timely received by the Bid & Proposal Room, Mail Code
      3802R.  Because EPA adheres to a centralized mail delivery system, any bid/proposal submitted via U.S. Mail to the address specified in
      block 8 of the SF 33 is initially routed to EPA’s mail handling facility at another location in S.W. Washington, DC, and then subsequently
      routed to EPA’s Bid & Proposal Room (Mail Code 3802R) located on the 6th floor of the Ronald Reagan Building.  The Bid and Proposal Room on
      the 6th floor of the Ronald Reagan Building is geographically distinct and is not co-located with the mail handling facility.
      Bids/proposals sent by U.S. Mail, therefore, will not be considered “received” until such time as they are physically delivered via EPA’s
      mail distribution system to the EPA Bid & Proposal Room in the Ronald Reagan Building.  Bidders/Offerors electing to utilize the U.S. Mail
      for bid/proposal delivery should therefore allow sufficient time prior to the designated time and date for bid/proposal receipt as
      specified in Block 9 of the SF 33 to allow for the internal routing of their bid/proposal to the EPA Bid & Proposal Room.

           All bids/proposals submitted other than by U.S. Mail should utilize the Hand Carried/Courier/Overnight Delivery Service address
           specified in Block 7 of the SF 33.

   c. Hand Carried/Courier Delivery- SF 33 Block 7

           EPA’s Bid & Proposal Room that is designated for receipt of hand delivered bids/proposals is located on the 6th floor of the Ronald
      Reagan Building (Room 61107), 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W., Washington, D.C.  The Bid and Proposal Room hours of operation are 8:00AM -
      4:30PM weekdays, except Federal holidays.  Because this is a secure area, EPA bidders/offerors/contractors and/or their couriers/delivery
      personnel must check in at the EPA visitor guard desk, located to the left of the 13 ½ street entrance, prior to gaining access to the Bid
      & Proposal Room.  A properly addressed bid/proposal, as described below, will be required for admittance to the Bid & Proposal Room.
      Bids/proposals not properly addressed will be collected by the guard, and routed to the Bid & Proposal Room through EPA’s internal mail
      distribution system, which will delay receipt of the bid/proposal in the Bid & Proposal Room.

   d. Overnight Delivery Services- SF 33 Block 7

           Bid/Proposal deliveries via overnight delivery services (e.g., Federal Express, Airborne Express) must utilize the address specified
      in block 7 of the SF 33.  Due to the large volume of overnight packages delivered to EPA at one time, all overnight delivery services
      deliver only to EPA’s loading dock at the Ronald Reagan Building, and not directly to the Bid & Proposal Room designated for receipt of
      bids/proposals in block 7 of the SF 33.  From the dock, packages are routed to EPA’s mail room in the Ronald Reagan Building for internal
      distribution, including distribution to the Bid & Proposal Room.  It is important to recognize that regardless of whether the Bid &
      Proposal Room is noted on the address label as required by block 7 of the SF 33, overnight delivery service packages are NOT regularly
      delivered directly to the Bid & Proposal Room.  Because bids and proposals must be physically received at the Bid & Proposal Room to be
      considered officially received, bidders/offerors should not rely upon guaranteed delivery times from overnight delivery services as
      guarantees that their bids/proposals will be officially received on time.  Bidders/offerors remain responsible for the timely delivery of
      their bids/proposals to the Bid & Proposal Room.

L.16  LC-19-06 EPA'S GOALS FOR SUBCONTRACTING WITH SMALL BUSINESSES (LOCAL CPOD 19-01) (MAR 2005) DEVIATION

   In accordance with FAR 52.219-9, Alternate II, the Contracting Officer is requesting all Large Businesses which submit an offer under a
negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) that is expected to result in a contract which will exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction)and have
subcontracting possibilities provide a subcontracting plan with their initial proposal.

   In reviewing offerors' subcontracting plans submitted in accordance with the provision entitled, "Utilization of Small Business Concerns,"
(FAR 52.219-8)and "Small Business Subcontracting Plan," (FAR 52.219-9) EPA will use its own goals as negotiated with SBA as an Agency guideline.
 EPA's Socio-Economic subcontracting goal currently totals 53.3%
of available subcontract dollars.  These goals currently breakout as follows:

                                          Percent of Subcontract
                                              Dollars Awarded


      Awards to Small Businesses                   53.3%
      Awards to Small Disadvantaged Businesses           20.0%
      Awards to Women-Owned Businesses              7.5%
      Awards to HUB Zone Businesses                       3.0%
      Awards to Service Disabled Veteran                  3.0%
      Small Businesses

   These goals are not intended to be mandatory; however, offerors (or apparent low bidder) are encouraged to keep these goals in mind when
developing their subcontracting plan.  Please note that goals must be proposed as a percentage of total dollars being subcontracted.

   A sample subcontracting plan format can be found on the Internet at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/ under the heading “Forms” and is titled
“  Model Subcontracting Plan Outline.”  This sample is available as a guide to assist offerors in preparation of subcontracting plans and is not
designated as mandatory.


L.17  Disclosure of Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest

(a) In addition to any other conflict of interest provisions described in this solicitation that may affect an offeror’s eligibility for award,
the RFP provision entitled, “Organizational Conflict of Interest Certification (EPAAR 1552.209-72),”  requires the offeror to certify whether it
is or it is not aware of a conflict, then the provision entitled “Organizational Conflicts of Interest Notification (EPAAR 1552.209-70),”
requires the offeror to provide a disclosure statement in its proposal describing all relevant information concerning any past, present or
planned interests bearing on whether it  (including its chief executives and any directors, or any proposed consultant or subcontractors) may
have a potential organizational conflict of interest.

(b) The proposal should include disclosure of activities involving or business relationships with (1) owners or operators of facilities which
may be regulated parties under the Clean Air Act (CAA); Clean Water Act (CWA); Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA);
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA);
Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuary Act (MPSRA);  Oil Pollution Act (OPA); and/or the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA); or (2) a firm
that is otherwise a stakeholder in some aspect of the OC programs.

(c)  Offerors responding to this solicitation are required to disclose any such business relationships or activities that could create an actual
or potential conflict of interest for the offeror in performing the work under the solicitation.  The disclosure statement must address actual,
potential, or organizational conflicts of interest within the offeror’s entire corporate umbrella, including parent company, sister companies,
affiliates, subsidiaries, and other interests held by the offeror.  In addition to identifying actual, potential or apparent organizational
conflicts of interest, the disclosure statement shall describe how any such conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated.  The EPA
Contracting Officer will determine an offeror’s eligibility for award based on the information provided in the disclosure statement.
(d) The purpose of requiring the information covered by the paragraphs above is to provide the Agency with an opportunity to assess its
vulnerabilities relative to organizational conflicts of interest of individual offerors prior to award.  The Agency recognizes that there exists
a need for firms to gain the requisite technical expertise necessary to fulfill the requirements of the proposed contract and that such
experience is often gained through provision of consulting or related technical services to firms in the hazardous waste industry.  Accordingly,
the fact that a firm has worked, is working, or plans to work for members of the hazardous waste community will not necessarily disqualify the
firm from consideration for award on the basis of actual, potential or apparent conflicts of interest (COI).  The more dependent a firm is on
commercial work with members of the hazardous waste community, the greater the risk to the Agency that there will arise during contract
performance a significant number of COI situations which would preclude the Agency from using the contractor’s support.  There is no set formula
for determining how much corporate business or activity with members of the hazardous waste community would result in a determination by the
Contracting Officer that award to a particular firm would not be in the best interest of the Government due to organizational conflict of
interest concerns.  Each offeror will be evaluated individually on the basis of the information disclosed pursuant to the requirements of this
solicitation and upon the adequacy of the offeror’s plan for avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating such conflicts.  In summary, the Agency is
seeking a technically qualified firm which can demonstrate that its corporate base of activities will not impact its ability to provide unbiased
work products to the Agency under the proposed contract.


L.18  CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN (LOCAL LC-09-04) (DEC 2001) DEVIATION

   As part of the initial offer, offerors shall submit an Organizational Conflict of Interest (COI) Plan which outlines the procedures in place
to identify and report conflicts of interest, whether actual or potential, throughout the period of contract performance.  The plan shall
address step by step the checks and balances in place to detect potential or actual conflict of interests, organizationally and with personnel,
that could result from activities covered by the Statement of Work.  The COI plan shall be incorporated into any resulting contract.

   The COI plan shall be evaluated in accordance with the provision in Section M.7 entitled, “EVALUATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN”.

   Additional information about the Agency’s minimum standards for Organizational Conflict of Interest Plans is provided in Section M.7,
“MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EPA CONTRACTOR’S CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN”.

L.19  Quality Management Plan

Each offeror, as a separate and identifiable part of its technical proposal, shall submit a Quality Management Plan setting forth the offeror’s
capability for quality assurance.  The plan shall address the following:

(a) A statement of policy concerning the organization’s commitment to implement a Quality Control/Quality Assurance(QA) program to assure
generation of measurement data of adequate quality to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work.
(b) An organizational chart showing the position of a QA function or person within the organization.  It is highly desirable that the QA
function or person be independent of the functional group which generate measurement data.

(c) A delineation of the authority and responsibilities of the QA function or person and the related data quality responsibilities of other
functional groups of the organization.

(d) The type and degree of experience in developing and applying Quality Control/Quality Assurance procedures to the proposed sampling and
measurement methods needed for performance of the Statement of Work.

(e) The background and experience of the proposed personnel relevant to accomplish the QA specifications in the Statement of Work.

(f) The offeror’s general approach for accomplishing the QA specifications in the Statement of Work.











L.20  Instructions for the Preparation of Technical Proposals

6. Small Disadvantaged Business Participation

   (a) Section M of this solicitation contains a source selection
factor or subfactor related to the participation of small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns in the performance of the contract. The nature
of the evaluation of an SDB offeror under this evaluation factor or subfactor is dependent upon whether the SDB concern qualifies for the price
evaluation adjustment under the clause at FAR 52.219-23, Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns and
whether the SDB concern specifically waives this price evaluation adjustment.

   (b) In order to be evaluated under the source selection factor or subfactor, an offeror must provide, with its offer, the following
information:

      (1) The extent of participation of SDB concerns in the performance of the contract in terms of the value of the total acquisition.
Specifically, offerors must provide targets, expressed as dollars and percentages of the total contract value, for SDB participation in the
applicable and authorized North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsectors as determined by the Department of Commerce.
Total dollar and percentage targets must be provided for SDB participation by the prime contractor, including team members and joint venture
partners. In addition, total dollar and percentage targets for SDB participation by subcontractors must be provided and listed separately;

      (2) The specific identification of SDB concerns to be involved in the performance of the contract;

      (3) The extent of commitment to use SDB concerns in the performance of the contract:

      (4) The complexity and variety of the work the SDB concerns are
to perform; and

      (5) The realism of the proposal to use SDB concerns in the performance of the contract.

   (c) An SDB offeror who waives the price evaluation adjustment provided in FAR 52.219-23 shall provide, with their offer, targets, expressed
as dollars and percentages of the total contract value, for the work that it intends to perform as the prime contractor in the applicable and
authorized North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsectors as determined by the Department of Commerce. All of the
offeror's identified targets described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause will be incorporated into and made part of any resulting
contract.












L.21  Instructions for the Preparation of Cost Proposals

The offeror shall prepare and submit cost or pricing information data and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408. In
addition to a hard copy of the information, to expedite review of the  proposal, submit a CD-rom containing the financial data required, if this
information is available using a commercial spreadsheet program on a personal computer. Submit this information using Microsoft Excel, if
possible. If the offeror used another spreadsheet program, indicate the software program used to create this information. Offerors should
include the formulas and factors used in calculating the financial data. Although submission of a computer disk will expedite review, failure to
submit a disk will not affect consideration of the proposal.

      (1) Clearly identify separate cost or pricing information associated with:

           (A) Options to extend the term of the contract;

           (B) Options for the Government to order incremental quantities;
               and

           (C) Major tasks, if required by the special instructions.



         (i) If other divisions, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated companies will perform work, provide the name and location of such
affiliate and offeror's intercompany pricing policy. Separately identify costs and supporting data for each entity proposed.

         (ii) The realism of costs, including personnel compensation rates (including effective hourly rates due to uncompensated overtime) will
be part of the proposal evaluation. Any reductions to proposed costs or differences between proposed and known EPA/DCAA  recommended rates must
be fully explained. If an offeror makes a reduction which makes its offer or portions of its offer below anticipated costs, the offeror shall
identify where (i.e., which elements of costs) the proposed reductions will be made. Unsubstantiated rates may result in an upward or downward
adjustment of the cost proposals to reflect more realistic costs. Based on this analysis, a projected cost for
the offeror will be calculated to reflect the Government's estimate of the offeror's probable costs. Any inconsistency, whether real or
apparent, between the promised performance and cost or price should be explained. The burden of proof for cost credibility rests with the
offeror.

      (2) Direct Labor.

         (i) The direct technical labor hours (level-of-effort) appearing in the solicitation are for professional and technical labor only.
These hours do not include management at a level higher than project management, e.g., corporate and day-to-day management, nor do they include
clerical and support staff at a level lower than technician. If it is the offeror's normal practice to charge these types of costs as direct
costs, include these costs along with an estimate of the directly chargeable labor-hours for these personnel. These
direct charges are to be shown separately from the technical (level-of-effort) effort. If this type of effort is normally included in the
offeror's indirect cost allocations, no estimate is required. However, direct charging of these on any resulting contract will not be allowed.
Additionally the direct technical labor hours are the workable hours required by the Government and do not include release time (i.e., holidays,
vacation, etc.) Submit the proposal utilizing the labor categories and distribution of the level-of-effort
specified in the solicitation. These are approximate distribution levels and do not necessarily represent the actual levels which may be
experienced
during contract performance.

         (ii) Explain the basis of the proposed labor rates, including a complete justification for all judgmental factors used to develop
weights applied to company's category or individual rates that comprise the rates for labor categories specified in the solicitation. This
explanation should describe how technical approach coincides with the proposed costs. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an average
of the individuals proposed to work on the contract, provide a list of the individuals proposed and the hours associated with each individual in
deriving the rates. If the proposed direct labor rates are based on an average of company category rates, identify and describe the labor
categories and the percentages associated with each category in deriving the rates, explaining in detail the basis for the percentages assigned.

         (iii) Describe for each labor category proposed, the company's qualifications and experience requirements. If individual rates are used,
provide the employee's name. If specific individuals are identified in the technical proposal, correlate these individuals with the labor
categories specified in the solicitation.

         (iv) Provide a matrix summarizing the effort proposed, including the subcontracts, by professional and technical level specified in the
solicitation.

         (v) Indicate whether current rates or escalated rates are used. If escalation is included, state the degree (percent) and methodology.
The methodology shall include the effective date of the base rates and the policy on salary reviews (e.g. anniversary date of employee or salary
reviews for all employees on a specific date).

         (vi) State whether any additional direct labor (new hire or temporary hires) will be required during the performance period of this
acquisition. If so, state the number required, the professional  or technical level and the methodology used to estimate proposed labor rates.


         (vii) With respect to educational institutions, include the following information for those professional staff members whose salary is
expected to be covered by a stipulated salary support agreement pursuant to OMB Circular A-21.
           (A) Individual's name;

           (B) Annual salary and the period for which the salary is applicable;

           (C) List of other research Projects or proposals for which salaries are allocated, and the proportionate time charged to each; and

           (D) Other duties, such as teaching assignments, administrative assignments, and other institutional activities. Show the
proportionate time charged to each. (Show proportionate time charges as a percentage of 100% of time for the entire academic year, exclusive of
vacation or sabbatical leave.)

         (viii) Uncompensated overtime. The decision to propose uncompensated overtime is the offeror's decision. Should the offeror, however,
elect to propose uncompensated overtime, the offeror must propose a methodology that is consistent with their cost accounting practices and
company policy. If proposed, provide an estimate of any uncompensated overtime proposed for exempt personnel working at the offeror's
facilities. This estimate should identify the number of uncompensated labor hours and the percentage of compensated labor. Uncompensated labor
hours are defined as hours for exempt personnel in excess of regular hours for a pay period which are actually worked and recorded in accordance
with company policy. Provide a copy of the company policy on uncompensated overtime. Provide historical percentages of uncompensated overtime
for the past three years. If proposed for subcontractors, provide separately with subcontractor information.

         (ix) For labor rate contracts, for each fixed labor rate, offerors shall identify the basis for for the loaded fixed hourly rate for
each contract period for example, the rate might consist of the following cost elements: raw wage or salary rate, plus fringe benefits (if
applicable), plus overhead rate (if applicable), plus G&amp;A expense rate (if applicable), plus profit.  When determining the composite raw
wage for a labor category,
the offeror shall:

           (A) provide in narrative form the basis for the raw wage for each labor category. If actual wages of current employees are used, the
basis for the projections should be explained.

           (B) If employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis Bacon Act, they must be compensated at least at the minimum wage
rate required by the applicable Wage Determination.

      (3) Indirect costs (fringe, overhead, general, and administrative expenses).

         (i) If the rates have been recently approved, include a copy of the rate agreement. If the agreement does not cover the projected
performance period of the proposed effort, provide the rationale and any estimated rate calculations for the proposed performance period.

        (ii) Submit supporting documentation for rates which have not been approved or audited. Indicate whether computations are based upon
historical or projected data.

       (iii) Provide actual pool expenses, base dollars, or hours (as applicable for the past five years). Include the actual indirect
rates for the past five years including the indirect rates proposed, the actual indirect rates experienced and, if available, the final
negotiated rate. Indicate the amount of unallowable costs included in the historical data.

       (iv) Offerors who propose indirect rates for new or substantially reorganized cost centers should consider offering to accept ceilings on
the indirect rates at the proposed rates. Similarly, offerors whose subcontractors propose indirect rates for new or substantially reorganized
cost centers should likewise consider offering to accept ceilings on the subcontractors' indirect rates at the proposed rates.

         Note to paragraph (b)(3)(iv): The Government reserves the right to adjust an offeror's or its subcontractor's estimated indirect costs
for evaluation purposes based on the Agency's judgment of the most probable costs up to the amount of any stated ceiling.

         (v) If the employees are subject to the Service Contract Act or Davis Bacon Act, employees must receive the minimum level of benefits
stated in the applicable Wage Determination.

      (4) Travel expense.

         (i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of travel costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect costs and fee.

         (ii) If the solicitation does not specify the amount of travel costs, attach a schedule illustrating how travel was computed. Include a
breakdown indicating number of trips, number of travelers, destinations from and to, purpose and cost, e.g., mileage, transportation costs,
subsistence rates.

      (5) Equipment, facilities and special equipment, including tooling.

         (i) If direct charges for use of existing contractor equipment are proposed, provide a description of these items, including estimated
usage hours, rates, and total costs.

         (ii) If equipment purchases are proposed, provide a description of these items, and a justification as to why the Government should
furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds. (Unless specified elsewhere in this solicitation, FAR 45.302-1 requires
contractors to furnish all facilities in performance of contracts with certain limited exceptions.)

         (iii) Identify Government-owned property in the possession of the offeror or proposed to be used in the performance of the contract, and
the Government Agency which has cognizance over the property.

         (iv) Submit proposed rates or use charges for equipment, along with documentation to support those rates.

      (v) If special purposes facilities or equipment are being proposed, provide a description of these items, details for the proposed costs
including competitive prices, and justification as to why the Government should furnish the equipment or allow its purchase with contract funds.
      (vi) If fabrication by the prime contractor is contemplated, include details of material, labor, and overhead.

      (6) Other Direct Costs (ODC).

         (i) If the solicitation specifies the amount of other direct costs, this amount is exclusive of any applicable indirect cost and fee.

         (ii) If the amount is not specified in the solicitation, attach a schedule detailing how other direct costs were computed.  Identify the
major ODC items that under the accounting system would be a direct charge on any resulting contract.

         (iii) If any of the cost elements identified as part of the specified other direct costs are recovered as an indirect cost, in
accordance with the offeror's accounting system, those costs should not be included as a direct cost. Complete explanation of this adjustment
and the contractor's practice should be provided.

         (iv) Provide historical other direct costs dollars per level of effort hour on similar contracts or work assignments.

      (7) Team Subcontracts. When the cost of a subcontract is substantial (more than 5 percent of the total estimated contract dollar value or
$100,000, whichever is less), the offeror shall include the following subcontractor information:

         (i) Provide details of subcontract costs in the same format as
the prime contractor's costs. This detailed information may be provided separately to the EPA if the subcontractor does not wish to provide this
data to the prime contractor. Cost data provided separately by a contractor must be received by the time, date and at the location specified for
the receipt of proposals. The subcontractor's package should be clearly marked with the RFP number, the name of the prime offeror, and a
statement that the package is subcontractor data relevant to the proposal from the prime offeror. If submitted with the prime contractor's
proposal, identify the subcontractors. State the amount of service estimated to be required and the quoted daily or hourly rate. Offerors are
encouraged to provide letters of intent, signed by subcontractors, agreeing to a specified rate for life of the contract. Include a cost or
price analysis of the subcontractor cost showing the reasons why the costs are considered reasonable;

         (ii) Describe how the prospective team subcontractors were chosen as part of the offeror's proposed team; and rationale for selection;

CNF and show calculation of the proposed amount. FCCM will be an allowable cost under the contemplated contract, if the criteria for
allowability at FAR 31.205-10(a)(2) are met.

Special Cost Proposal Instructions:

The period of performance for this contract includes a two-year Base period, a two-year option period, and a one-year option period.

The Government anticipates making award on initial offers, without discussions.  Therefore, the cost proposal should be prepared in sufficient
detail to permit thorough and complete evaluation by the Government without additional correspondence or communication.  During its evaluation,
the Government may request clarifications, answers to questions that assist in the Government’s understanding of information contained in the
cost proposal, or the correction of minor omissions or errors that do not alter the offer.  Consequently, failure to provide sufficient cost
details, supporting documentation, and the required schedules, may result in the rejection of the offer if the Government awards on initial
proposals.

If the Contracting Officer determines that an Offeror’s initially proposed costs do not reflect what it would reasonably cost that Offeror to
perform the requirements, then the Contracting Officer may make adjustments to the proposed costs in accordance with FAR 15.404 (d)(2)(ii) to
determine cost realism.

           2. Total Summary of each period of the Contract
                 (See Schedule 2)
           3. Total Summary of each Base Quantity for each year of the Contract (See Schedule 3)
           4. Total Summary of each Optional Quantity for each year of the Contract (See Schedule 4)

NOTE: Included Cost Schedules may be used by the offeror; however, offerors should tailor the model to their own standard accounting practices.

All costs, rates, factors, and calculations must be shown and supporting rationale and documentation included.

Financial Information- The offeror shall submit financial statements, including a balance sheet, a statement of profit and loss, and cash flow,
for the last completed fiscal year and current year-to-date.  Specify resources available to perform the Contract without assistance from any
outside source.  If sufficient resources are not available, indicate in your proposal the amount required and the anticipated source (ie. bank
loans, letter or lines of credit, etc.).

If other divisions, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated companies will perform work or furnish materials under this proposed contract, please
provide the name and location of such affiliates and your inter-company pricing policy.  Separately identify costs and supporting data for each
entity proposed.

Whenever subcontractor effort is included in the proposed costs, the prime contractor shall include an additional supporting cost summary
consolidating all costs (both prime and subcontractor) by element for each contract period.

II. Direct Labor

A. Provide the proposed hourly labor rates for all labor categories utilized in the proposal.  Clearly indicate any algorithm or calculations
used to compute the proposed direct labor rates and show how the proposed rates compare to current employees’ or category average rates.
Provide the rationale and basis for the labor rates proposed; for example, company-wide bidding rates, current salary data for named
individuals, survey data, anticipated new hires, etc.

Provide the current labor rates from payroll records and, also those labor rates escalated to the cost proposal performance period TBD through
TBD.

B. For the purpose of evaluation offerors shall propose the following level-of-effort (LOE) hours for each period of the contract (Base Period
and Options I and II).  These labor hours represent the Government’s best estimate of the level of effort to be ordered under the contract to be
awarded.

                            Base Quantity                Option Increment

      Base Year              13,377 hours                13,380 hours
      Option Period I        13,377 hours                13,380 hours
      Option Period II       6,689 hours                        6,690 hours


The hours identified above do not include management at a level higher than the project management, or the clerical support staff.  If it is
your normal practice to charge these types of personnel as a direct cost, your proposal must include them along with an estimate of the directly
chargeable labor hours for these personnel.  If this type of effort is normally included in your indirect cost allocations, no estimate is
required.  However, any charging of indirect costs on any resulting contract will not be allowed if not originally included in the offeror’s
proposal.

For proposal purposes, offerors can assume an equal distribution of hours annually within the specified ordering periods of the contract.  The
actual distribution of hours utilized during the contract performance may vary significantly from that which is depicted above.

When identifying individuals assigned to the project, specify which of the professional categories the individual belongs. In addition, the
direct labor hour mix and personnel proposed as part of the cost proposal shall be the same as proposed in the technical proposal.

III. Escalation

develop the cost proposal.  Also, provide actual expense pool amounts, allocation bases, and rates which have been submitted to the Defense
Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) or other cognizant Government audit office, in your overhead rate proposal for establishing final indirect rates.

Cost ceilings may be required under this contract for the prime or one or more subcontractors.  Offerors should review the situations described
in FAR 42.707(b)(1) to determine whether or not ceilings should be utilized, and when appropriate propose ceilings.

NOTE: The Government reserves the right to adjust an offeror’s, or its subcontractor’s estimated indirect costs for evaluation purposes based on
the agency’s judgement of the most probable costs up to the amount of the stated ceiling.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



M.1   EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (FAR 52.217-5) (JUL 1990)

   Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate
offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirements. Evaluation of options will
not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

M.2   EPA SOURCE EVALUATION AND SELECTION PROCEDURES--NEGOTIATED PROCUREMENTS (EPAAR 1552.215-70) (AUG 1999)

   (a) The Government will perform source selection in accordance with FAR Part 15 and the EPA Source Evaluation and Selection Procedures in

      (1)   The Government will perform either cost analysis or price analysis of the offeror’s cost/business proposal in accordance with FAR
           Parts 15 and 31, as appropriate.  In addition, the Government will also evaluate proposals to determine contract cost or price
           realism.  Cost or price realism relates to an offeror’s demonstrating that the proposed cost or price provides an adequate reflection
           of the offeror’s understanding of the requirements of this solicitation, i.e., that the cost or price is not unrealistically low or
           unreasonably high.

      (2)   The Government will evaluate technical proposals as specified in 1552.215-71, Evaluation Factors for Award.

   (b) In addition to evaluation of the previously discussed elements, the Government will consider in any award decision the responsibility
factors set forth in FAR Part 9.



M.3   EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD (EPAAR 1552.215-71) (AUG 1999)

   (a) The Government will make award to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the

M.4   MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EPA CONTRACTOR'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLANS (LOCAL LRT-09-08) (DEC 2001)

   1. PURPOSE

      The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified a need to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate actual and potential contractor conflicts
of interest (COI).  To accomplish this, contractors are required to have a COI plan for identifying and reporting actual and potential COI.  The
purpose of this document is to set forth the minimum standards for a contractor's COI plan.

   2. COI PLAN

      The contractor's COI Plan is a document which describes the procedures a company uses to identify and report COI.  Generally, a
contractor's corporate COI plan will describe how a company, in its entirety, addresses conflicts, and will not be contract or program specific.
 The plan may also describe the options a company will consider proposing to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate a COI whenever a conflict is
identified.  The plan will be evaluated and approved by the applicable EPA Contracting Officer (CO) if the COI Plan meets the EPA's minimum
requirements for detecting and reporting conflicts of interest.  Contractor's COI Plans should be identified by a version number, date, and
applicable CO for any previously approved COI Plan.

   3. MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR CONTRACTORS' COI PLANS


      A. Corporate Structure

      The COI Plan shall describe any parent relationship and list all affiliates, subsidiaries, and sister companies, etc.  Generally this need
not exceed three corporate tiers, unless a relationship exists beyond three tiers that would potentially create a conflict.  In such a case,
relationships beyond three tiers should also be included in the COI Plan.  Contractors should report changes in its corporate structure to the
Agency throughout contract performance.

      Contractors are invited to include under this section a company profile.  The profile should discuss all pertinent information relevant to
COI including a summary of a contractor's primary and/or environmental business functions and activities.  This background information will be
very useful to COS when evaluating whether or not a contractor has a COI.

      B. Searching and Identifying COI

      The COI Plan shall include a requirement describing when a COI search must be performed by company personnel and clearly identify the
procedures to be followed.  The searching requirement shall encompass all work related to all clients for whom work was performed over the last
three years, all current work, all sites (if applicable) and any future work reflected in marketing proposals.  Contractors must search their
records over the past 36 months, or through all available records for a new company until 36 months of records are accumulated, from the time of
receipt of the work from EPA.  However, contractors are encouraged to search back as far as a company's records cover.

      C. Data Base

      The COI Plan shall require a data base that includes all necessary information for a contractor to review its past work (at a minimum over
the past 36 months or through all available records for a new company until 36 months of records are accumulated), work in progress, and work
the company may be pursuing under any marketing proposals.  This requirement does not establish any particular type or kind of retrieval system,
however, the data base shall contain, at a minimum, the following information and capabilities.

         (1) a list of the company's past and public clients;
         (2) a description of the type(s) of work that was performed and any
             other pertinent information;
         (3) a list of the past sites (when applicable) a contractor
             has worked on;
         (4) a list of site name(s) (when applicable) related to any
             work performed;
         (5) the ability to search and retrieve the information in
             the data base; and
         (6) dollar value of work performed.

      If applicable, the COI Plan shall include provisions for supplemental searches of parent, affiliate, subsidiary, or sister company records.
 The COI Plan shall also describe any cross-checks used by the company when searching COI issues.

      D. Personal Certification

      At a minimum, the COI Plan shall require ALL employees of the company performing work under an EPA Superfund and/or Non-Superfund contract,
including work on a site, work relating to a site, work pertaining to a CERCLA/RCRA action, or work that may endanger a CERCLA enforcement
action, to sign a personal certification.  EPA recommends a policy whereby all company employees are required to sign such a certification
rather than only those employees working under an EPA contract.  The certification shall require at a minimum, that the individual agrees to
report to the proper company authority any personal COI and that the individual has read and understands the company's COI Plan and procedures.
Employee certifications shall be retained by the company.

      E. Work Assignment (WA), Technical Direction Document (TDD), or
Delivery Order (DO) Notification and Certification

         The COI Plan shall describe the process the company requires for notifying the Agency prior to beginning work, and for submission of its
WA/TDD/DO certification within 20 days of receipt of the work from EPA.

         NOTE:  WA/TDD/DO certifications are NOT required if the contract contains an annual certification requirement.  Nevertheless, the
contractor's COI Plan should address the procedures to be followed for WA/TDD/DO certifications.

      F. Annual Certification

         The COI Plan shall describe the process the company requires for submission of its annual certification.

         NOTE:  Annual certification is NOT required if the contract contains a WA/TDD/DO certification requirement.  Nevertheless, the
contractor's COI Plan should address the procedures to be followed for annual certifications.

      G. Notification and Documentation

         The COI Plan shall clearly delineate the official within the company responsible for making COI determinations.  Generally, this would
be someone at a middle to upper level of management.  The responsible official shall be free of any personal conflicts for the purpose of making
COI determination, e.g., a program manager who receives bonuses based on the total amount of sales may not be free of conflicts.

         The plan shall clearly identify the process that is required when notifying the EPA of any actual or potential COI and the actions that
the company has taken or will take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the conflict.  In addition, the contractor shall document all COI searches
related to EPA work, whether or not an actual or potential COI has been identified.

      H. Training

         The COI Plan shall require all employees of the company to receive basic COI training and that each employee receive COI awareness
training at least annually.  The company's COI Plan shall be available for all employees to review.  Annual awareness training shall include, at
a minimum, a review of the certification language and any changes that may have occurred in the company's COI Plan.  In addition, companies are
encouraged to routinely disseminate to their employees current COI information.

      I. Subcontractor's COI Plans


         The COI Plan shall describe the process and mechanism by which the company will monitor its subcontractors to ensure all subcontractors
are complying with the COI provisions in their contracts.  It is important that subcontractors identify and report COI as well as submit
Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) requests for approval.

      Indirect Cost Rates - identify by cost center, the indirect cost rate, the period, and the cost base to which it is applied.

      Subcontracts - identify the major cost elements for each subcontract.

      Other Direct Costs - when the cost for an individual cost (e.g., photocopying, material and supplies, telephone usage) exceeds $1,000 per
      the invoice period, provide a detailed explanation for that cost category.

      Contractor Acquired Equipment (if authorized by the contract) - identify by item the quantities, unit prices, and total dollars billed.

of the date of the invoice.  The amount under (2) shall include costs originally suspended and later disallowed.  Also include an explanation of
the changes in cumulative costs suspended or disallowed by addressing each adjustment in terms of:  voucher number, date, dollar amount, source,
and reason for the adjustment.  Disallowed costs should be identified in unallowable accounts in the contractor's accounting system.


      SUPPORTING SCHEDULES FOR FIXED-RATE CONTRACTS

      Direct Labor - identify by labor category the number of hours, fixed hourly rate, and the total dollars billed for the period of the
      invoice.

      Subcontracts - identify the major cost elements for each subcontract.

      Other Direct Costs - when the cost for an individual cost (e.g., photocopying, material and supplies, telephone usage) exceeds $1,000 per
      the invoice period, provide a detailed explanation for that cost category.

      Indirect Cost Rates - identify by cost center, the indirect cost rate, the period, and the cost base to which it is applied.

      of origin, destination, purpose of trip, transportation by unit price, per diem rates on daily basis and total dollars billed.  Detailed
      reporting is not required for local travel.

      The manner of breakdown, e.g., work assignment/delivery order basis with/without separate program management, contract period will be
      specified in the contract instructions.

NOTE:  Any costs requiring advance consent by the Contracting Officer will be considered improper and will be suspended, if claimed prior to
receipt of Contracting Officer consent.  Include the total cost claimed for the current and cumulative-to-date periods.  After the total amount
claimed, provide summary dollar amounts of cumulative costs:  (1) suspended as of the date of the invoice; and (2) disallowed on the contract as
of the date of the invoice.  The amount under (2) shall include costs originally suspended and later disallowed.  Also include an explanation of
the changes in cumulative costs suspended or disallowed by addressing each adjustment in terms of:  voucher number, date, dollar amount, source,
and reason for the djustment.  Disallowed costs should be identified in unallowable accounts in the contractor's accounting system.

RESUBMISSIONS

      When an original voucher was submitted, but not paid in full because of suspended costs and after receipt of a letter of removal of
      suspension, resubmissions of any previously claimed amounts which were suspended should be submitted in a separate invoice showing the
      original voucher number and designated with the letter "R" with the copy of the removal of suspension notice.  The amounts should be shown
      under the appropriate cost category and include all appropriate supplemental schedules.  NOTE:  All disallowances must be identified as
      such in the accounting system through journal entries.

      Voucher resubmittals may also occur as a result of:  (1) a new indirect cost rate agreement; or (2) adjustments to previously billed direct
      cost rates due to audit resolution.  Such claims should be submitted in a separate invoice or request for contractor financing payment
      number.  They should include supplemental schedules showing the previously adjusted amounts by contract period.  If the resubmission is
      based on a new rate agreement, a copy of the agreement should be attached.  Costs must be identified by delivery order or work assignment
      where appropriate.  If the contract is Superfund-related, voucher resubmittals shall also identify the amount claimed against each
      Superfund site and non-site-specific activity.

COMPLETION VOUCHERS

      Submit a completion voucher when all performance provisions of the contract are physically complete, when the final report (if required) is
      accepted, and when all direct costs have been incurred and booked.  Indirect costs may be claimed at the provisional rates, if final rates
      are not yet available.  Contractors must identify these vouchers by typing "Completion Voucher" next to the voucher number.  For contracts
      separately invoiced by delivery order, provide a schedule showing total costs claimed by delivery order and in total for the contract.

      In addition to the completion voucher, the contractor must submit an original and two copies of EPA Form 1900-10, Contractor's Cumulative
      Claim and Reconciliation showing the total cumulative costs claimed under the contract.

      The information which a contractor is required to submit in its EPA Form 1900-10 is set forth as follows:

      (1)   Contractor's Name and Address - show the name of the contractor exactly as it appears in the contract and its correct address, except
           when an assignment has been made by the contractor, or the right to receive payment has been restricted, as in the case of an advance
           account.  When the right to receive payment is restricted, the type of information to be shown in this space shall be furnished by
           the Contracting Officer.

      (2)   Contract Number - insert the number of the contract under which reimbursement is claimed.

      (3)   First voucher number and completion voucher number.

      (4)   Total amount of cost claimed for each cost element category through the completion voucher.

      (5)   Total Fee awarded.

      (6)   Amount of indirect costs calculated using negotiated final indirect cost rate(s) and/or provisional rate(s) as specified in the
           contract, if final rate(s) are not yet negotiated for any fiscal period.

      (7)   Fiscal year.

      (8)   Indirect cost center.

      (9)   Appropriate basis for allocation.

      (10)  Negotiated final indirect cost rate(s) or provisional indirect cost rate(s).

      (11)  Signature.

      (12)  Official title.

      (13)  Date.

FINAL VOUCHER AND CLOSING DOCUMENTS

      After completion of the final audit and all suspensions and/or audit exceptions have been resolved as to the final allowable costs and fee,
      including establishment of final indirect cost rate(s) for all periods the contractor shall prepare a final voucher including any
      adjustments to vouchered costs necessitated by the final settlement of the contract price.  Contractors must identify these vouchers by
      typing "Final Voucher" next to the voucher number.  For contracts separately invoiced by delivery order, provide a schedule showing final
      total costs claimed by delivery order and in total for the contract.  The contractor shall also provide an original and two copies of an
      updated EPA Form 1900-10, Contractors Cumulative Claim and Reconciliation, showing the total negotiated, cumulative costs for the contract.
       Indirect costs shall be included at the final negotiated rates.


      In addition to the final voucher, the contractor must submit an original and two copies of the Contractor's Release; Assignee's Release, if
      applicable; the Contractor's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, Credits and other Amounts; the Assignee's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates,
      Credits and other Amounts, if applicable; and the Contractor's Affidavit of Waiver of Lien, when required by the contract.

N/A - Not Applicable

5 - Exceptional- Performance meets contract requirements and significantly exceeds contract requirements to the Government’s benefit.  For
example, the contractor implemented innovative or business process reengineering techniques, which resulted in added value to the Government.
The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions
taken by the contractor were highly effective.

4 - Very Good- Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the
element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were
effective.

3 - Satisfactory- Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor
problems for which proposed corrective actions taken by the contractor appear satisfactory, or completed corrective actions were satisfactory.

2 - Marginal- Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed
reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has submitted minimal corrective actions, if any.  The contractor’s proposed actions appear
only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.

1 - Unsatisfactory- Performance does not meet contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely or cost effective manner.  The
contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were
ineffective.

0 - Incompetent- Performance never meets contractual requirements and damages have resulted from performance.  The contractual performance of
the element or sub-element is totally insufficient and without merit.

      REPORTS OF WORK

                                                       REPORT DESCRIPTION (REPORT OF WORK)

GENERAL

      All reports and data prepared under this contract must be compatible for personal computers, e.g. Microsoft Word, WordPerfect 8.0. or
Excel.  Individual work assignments may require the delivery of study results in both hard copy and on disks compatible with EPA’s mainframe
computers.

WORK PLAN

1. Original Work Plan

      The Contractor shall submit one copy of the work plan/cost estimates to the Contracting Officer for approval no-later than twenty-five(25)
calendar days after the effective date of each work assignment order unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer.  A copy of the plan
shall also be submitted to the Project Officer. The work plan shall consist of the following:

      a. A brief narrative statement reflecting the methods and technical approach to be used by the Contractor in achieving the requirements set
      forth in the work assignment. This narrative shall include an introduction along with the planned project approach, schedule of work and
      staffing.

      b. The program schedule in sufficient detail to access each work assignment.

      c. An estimated cost budget breakdown for the work assignment with costs by each labor category, overhead, any special testing, travel,
      consultants and/or subcontractors, other direct costs, and estimated fee. Cost rates and extended totals for all direct cost elements
      should be included.

2. Revision to Work Plan

      The Contractor shall submit revisions to the work plan described above (a) when the original work assignment is not approved by the
Contracting Officer; (b) when directed by the Project Officer pursuant to the clause entitled “Technical Direction;" (c) whenever the contract
requirements are changed by appropriate work assignment amendments; (d) as soon as it appears that actual costs expended plus projected costs to
complete the work assignment may exceed the original approval work plan budget estimate; and/or when 75% of the estimated hours to complete the
assignment have been expended and an adjustment in the approved budget cost estimate would be required to complete the work. The Contractor may
submit recommended revisions deemed desirable for optimum achievement of contract objectives. Every revision to the work plan shall be approved
by the Contracting Officer prior to implementation by the Contractor.


3. Work Plan Approval

      Approval of each work plan by the Government is contingent upon the proposed performance approach, schedule, staffing adequacy, estimated
level of effort, and relative budget for accomplishing the assignment. Work plan approval does NOT constitute authorization to exceed the
contract funded cost, not to perform outside the contract scope of work, nor does it constitute subcontractor consent. Also, the approval does
not constitute a determination of the reasonableness of cost or allow ability, nor an agreement on the fee for the respective work assignment
since the fee for providing the contract level of effort is set forth in the contract itself.


                                                                 REPORTS OF WORK


                                                                 Report By E-mail

   During the period of performance of this contract, the Contractor shall immediately inform the Project Officer, Work Assignment Manager, and
  Contracting Officer by e-mail of any problems that may impede performance along with any corrective actions needed by the Contractor or EPA to
                                                                solve the problem.

                                                                 SUMMARY REPORTS

      At the completion of each work assignment, the Contractor shall submit one copy of its proposed summary report to the Project Officer and
the Work Assignment Manager for review, with a copy to the Contracting Officer.

      The proposed report shall document in detail all of the work performed under the work assignment including data, analyses, and
interpretations, as well as recommendations and conclusions based upon results obtained. The report shall include tables, graph, diagrams,
sketches, curves, photographs and drawings in sufficient detail to comprehensively explain the results achieved under the work assignment. The
report shall be complete in itself and contain no reference, directly or indirectly, to the periodic reports. For the work assignments requiring
quality assurance, the report shall describe the quality assurance procedures used and the validity and accuracy of the results.

      After receipt of the Contractor's proposed summary report, the Contracting Officer, Project Officer, and Work Assignment Manager may
require the Contractor to present, at a site chosen by the requester, an informal briefing and review of all work performed under-the work
assignment.

      Approval or disapproval (in part or in total) of the summary report will be accomplished by the Project Officer within 30 calendar days
after receipt.  The Contractor shall correct disapproved reports and revised summary reports and resubmit them for review by the Contracting
Officer and Project Officer within fifteen(15)calendar days following notification of the cited deficiency(ies) unless otherwise directed by the
Contracting Officer, or Project Officer.

      Within thirty (30) calendar days after notification of approval of the proposed report by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall
distribute the specified number of copies, including a reproducible master copy, of the approved report to the people indicated below.

                                                               REPORT DISTRIBUTION
