52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous (provide the best value) to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used
to evaluate the offers: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  The order of importance of these factors is: Technical, Past Performance and
Price.  When combined Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  Specifically, the Government is using
Simplified Acquisition Procedures with Best Value Basis and Trade-Off Procedures for this procurement.


   Evaluation Factors:
    Factor 1:  Technical Capability/Quality of Products and Services.  Vendors will be evaluated on how well they demonstrate their ability to
   perform the requirement as set forth in the Statement of Work as well as on the general quality of the proposed products and services.
    Factor 2:  Past Performance: Vendor’s Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the vendor’s likelihood of success on the present
   requirement.
    Factor 3:  Price:  Price will be evaluated to ensure price reasonableness.  Price will be considered by the Government when determining the
   best value offer.

(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement.  This evaluation will include an option to extend services for 6 months (as allowed by FAR 52.217-8) to run after the completion of
the last annual option period. The Government will extrapolate the vendor’s pricing of the last annual option period to arrive at a price for
the potential six (6) month extension of services option. The Government may determine that a offer is unacceptable if the option prices are
significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice
of withdrawal is received before award.

Addendum to Provision:

(d) If the subject solicitation has been issued as a Request for Quotation, all references to offer and offeror are hereby changed to offer and
vendor respectively, except for in paragraph (c), which stands as written.    If a quote is provided, the Government may make an offer based on
all or part of a vendor’s quote, as originally presented or as subsequently modified.

(e) If any component of the contractor’s offer is not acceptable to the Government, then the Government may reject the offer without further
evaluation.

(f) Section 508.  Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the quote adequately
addresses the requirements for Section 508.

(End of provision)

2.0  BACKGROUND

2.1  DoDEA provides French language coursework in selected middle schools and high schools (grades 7-12).  French courses are based on national
foreign language standards as defined by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) and on the DoDEA World Language (WL)
Standards & Proficiency Expectations. French courses deliver the understanding, knowledge and communication skills needed for students to
communicate in French.  Specific information on DoDEA WL Standards & Proficiency Expectations, which may be found at:
http://www.dodea.edu/curriculum/foreignLanguage/index.cfm.

2.2 The Advanced Placement (AP) French Language and Culture courses are based on the College Board’s course description and reflect the current
assessed themes and subthemes: http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/descriptions/index.html.

|Section 508 (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=policies) requires that federal agencies electronic and information technology is   |
|accessible to people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and |
|information technology.                                                                                                                     |

|(http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=1998Amend) are determined as applicable to this acquisition based on the following technical    |
|provisions: To understand the technical standards that apply to each provision, the respondent should refer to http://Section 508.gov at    |
|http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsdoc.                                                                                         |

|This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated|
|with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation |
|respondents as a part of their quote to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements.             |
|                                                                                                                                            |
|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard.        |
|Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT          |
|requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition |
|have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics          |
|corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement  |
|applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.                                                                       |

|The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding |
|to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as     |
|defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information  |
|content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.                                                                                         |
