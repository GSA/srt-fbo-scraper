Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 Treasury's USSGL iTRAK is a joint effort between the Office of Budget, Finance and Administration (BFA) and the Office of Information Resources Management (OIRM). The BFA includes the Chief Financial Officer's office and the OIRM includes the Chief Information Officer's office.

2.0 Background
The NSF mission is "To promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense." To fulfill this mission, NSF has an annual budget of over $6 billion and is the premier Federal agency supporting research across all fields of nonmedical science and engineering education. NSF funds more than 40 percent of the Federal support for nonmedical basic research at America's colleges and universities, and in 2008 alone, provided funding to 1,900 colleges, universities, and other institutions. With the creation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2009, NSF's budget increased to $9 billion. In addition, since 1952, the Foundation has supported approximately 44,000 students through Graduate Research Fellowships and annually provides direct support to researchers, postdoctoral fellows, trainees, and teachers as well as students. Through its investment in people--their education and the research they conduct--NSF helps keep America at the leading edge of science, engineering, and technology.

3.0 Current Environment
Underlying the Foundation's investment in people are the financial management system and programs that enable funding for education and research initiatives to be received, allocated, and managed within budget and according to Federal laws and regulations. NSF's legacy financial management system, the Financial Accounting System (FAS), is the Division of Financial Management's (DFM) primary vehicle for managing funding allocated to the National Science Foundation. Central transaction management represents the core of the system, handling transaction processing, accounts maintenance, transaction history, and rules processing. The system includes extensive reporting capabilities to assist DFM and Administrative Officers in verifying funds throughout the fiscal year. The system support extensive editing for transactions input through the FAS as well as from other systems that interface with the FAS system. This system went into production in the client-server environment on April 23, 2001. Technical Description: The FAS was written and currently maintained using the following environments: Application Software: Database Engine: Database Server: C++, Sybase PowerBuilder V10.x with NSF PFC Framework Sybase SQL Server System 12.5.0.3 Sun E5500 Unix Server Running Solaris (Development) SunFire 6800 Unix Server/Solaris (Production) SunFire 6800 Unix Server/Solaris (User Acceptance) SunOS 5.8 Sybase Open Connect Windows 9X, Windows NT, Windows XP

3.1 Limitations of As-Is Environment
FAS requires increasing time, effort, and funding to operate, maintain, and remain in compliance with Federal financial management regulations. While FAS has served the Foundation well for more than 20 years, the antiquated technology on which FAS is built makes continued compliance with Federal financial management requirements increasingly difficult and costly. It also severely limits NSF's ability to respond to emerging internal business needs and goals. More specifically, FAS poses the following performance gaps: Inadequate automated processing support and controls. The system has many manual processes, with a high potential for human error and duplication of effort. These manual processes increase both the level of effort to develop and test system change requests and the risk of reduced financial information integrity, effectiveness, and timeliness. This was an audit finding during the 2008 and 2009 financial statement audits. Lack of standard business processes and key functionality. As an in-house, legacy financial system, FAS has evolved based on immediate needs rather than strategic goals over the past two decades. FAS is expensive to operate and maintain, relies on outdated architecture and technologies, and offers very limited management and decision support functionality-- it does not meet NSF's mission requirements. Transparency. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) established new award reporting requirements and procedures in an effort to increase the transparency of federally funded awards. In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) also created new, separate reporting requirements necessitating increased transparency, accuracy, and frequency of financial data. To meet FFATA and ARRA requirements, FAS requires difficult and costly modifications, which can be better met by a COTS financial shared services solution. Non-Compliance Risk. The system is at risk of not meeting Federal standards, such as OMB Circular A-127, FFMIA, FMFIA, and Treasury mandates. OMB Circular A-127. A-127 requires agencies to record financial events at the transaction level consistent with applicable definitions, attributes, and processing rules of the USSGL. FAS has a number of transaction codes non-compliant with the U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) and established Treasury standards. Federal Core Financial System Requirements. A growing number of variances exist between current FAS functionality and Federal Core Financial systems requirements. Examples include the following:
5

FAS lacks the capability to produce Financial Statements. As a result, NSF must maintain statements in Excel spreadsheets, which requires extensive manual operations and data manipulation. FAS does not have the functionality to track the details of receivables. This information is stored and tracked in Excel spreadsheets, increasing the risk of miscalculations or human errors due to lack of automation and adequate controls. Costly Maintenance. FAS is at the end of its lifecycle, with a greater share of its maintenance budget spent on fixes rather than value-added enhancements. (In FY 2007, 95% of the FAS budget was spent on daily operations and preventive activities with only 5% of the budget focused on closing compliance gaps.)

4.0 Objectives and Goals
The objectives of the iTRAK solution are to provide robust functionality and financial information that will facilitate management decision making and create operating efficiencies in supporting NSF's mission. iTRAK will position NSF to provide accurate and reliable financial information to the Science Directorates and the grantee community without the substantial manual processes; address growing financial reporting requirements; maintain clean audit opinions; and provide continued financial management excellence to NSF. The objective of iTRAK is the successful implementation of a COTS Core Financial management system and key interfaces. Specific iTRAK goals are as follows: Goal I. Increase capabilities for more informed operational and programmatic decision-making. 1. Improve financial data accuracy and consistency. 2. Improve enterprise-level financial data access, transparency, and reporting. 3. Make timely and accurate financial data available for NSF Program Managers to track and monitor program progress. Goal II. Improve effectiveness and efficiency of financial and business processes. 1. Implement standard business processes and operating procedures. 2. Reduce manual processes. 3. Integrate data to reduce redundancy and reconciliation issues. Goal III. Enhance financial and business accountability, integrity, and compliance. 1. Automate controls and reconciliation points where appropriate 2. Improve traceability of transactions where appropriate 3. Provide for system flexibility and agility to meet current and future mandated Federal requirements.

1 Background
The Financial Accounting System (FAS) is NSFs primary vehicle for managing funding. Central transaction management represents the core of the system, handling transaction processing, accounts maintenance, transaction history, and rules processing. The system includes reporting capabilities to assist NSF in verifying funds throughout the fiscal year. The system supports extensive editing for transactions input through the FAS as well as through other systems that interface with FAS. The iTRAK solution will replace FAS and should be a fully integrated financial management system. It shall use commercial off the shelf (COTS) products to leverage financial management system best practices.

2 FAS Interfaces
FAS is integrated with several grants management as well as administrative systems at NSF mainly for posting financial and non financial transactions; and utilizing FAS data as reference data for look ups, validations, and reporting. The following Table 1: FAS Interfaces provides a summary of the systems interfacing with FAS.
Table 1: FAS Interfaces

Institution System

Non-financial transactions

Institution system is a custom built application for maintaining vendors and grantees data and is used for the NSF Grants Management Systems. Grant systems require specific information for reporting, audit and compliance. In the future state, new grantee and vendor header records are updated in Institution and sent to the financial system. A future interface, as a replacement and enhancement of Federal Financial Reporting functionality in FastLane and Research.gov systems, to be implemented before the iTRAK implementation. It will allow grantees to request payments at the individual grant level in near/real time. Expected frequencies of payment transactions are between 2,000 and 25,000 daily, with an average expected frequency of 11,000 daily. A future interface that will store current and historic financial data providing end user reporting for financial and operational information across the enterprise. Interfaces with the FedTraveler system hosted by HP with FAS. \

3 iTRAK Interface Requirements
NSF is in the process of changing the FAS interfaces to operate on "Open Standards" such as Web Services and Data Services. This transition is planned to be completed in time for the iTRAK implementation. With this being the assumption the iTRAK system integrator is expected to integrate the COTS system with NSFs legacy systems as listed in section 2.0 using a standards based open architecture APIs as listed below. 3.1

Proposed Integration Architecture:

For transactional interfaces NSF plans on Web Services architecture using SOAP, HTTPs, WSDL, XML and JMS. The security on the interface must be FIPS complaint. The solution should support both synchronous (real-time) and a-synchronous (near real-time) transactions as well as processing transactions in batch. For the data integration platform NSF plans on using data services that would periodically push the data from iTRAK to the NSFs Enterprise Data Warehouse. NSFs Enterprise Data Warehouse is hosted on Oracle 10g database platform as outlined in Figure 1: iTRAK Integration Landscape. 3.2 Interfacing with Business Services Layer: NSF will work with the iTRAK integrator to establish the contract that includes the schema definitions and WSDL signatures for processing a business transaction. A list of sample input and output parameters are identified in Appendix B. The integrator is expected to plug-in the respective COTS based APIs with in the business layer built by NSF as outlined in Figure 1: iTRAK Integration Landscape.

Description Post a financial transaction such as a commitment, obligation, payment, journal entry; as well as perform a funds check against the accounting system Get a new Bill ID for processing receivables Get a new Disbursement ID for processing payments Insert Disbursement information for processing payments Insert information related to a travel obligation

Data Extraction

As identified in Figure:1 iTRAK Integration Landscape, the iTRAK solution should have capability to extract data such as reference data and transactional data, from the Core Financial system and load it into NSF staging area for it to be available for other systems and reporting/analytics. The iTRAK system integrator would be responsible for extracting the data from the new system and loading it to the staging area as specified. The frequency of data load would be on a daily basis.

6

The new solution should have a capability to extract data into the Data Warehouse. NSF would work with the iTRAK system integrator to identify data objects to be loaded in the staging area. A list of sample reference data objects is mentioned below: Appropriation Organization Program Object Class Code Individual data Grantee and Vendor data Custom Reference Codes (to be identified during implementation) 3.5

Integration with NSF's Enterprise Identity Management System

For the Identity integration NSF plans on using identity services to consume Authentication information to log into the application. iTRAK should have the capability to consume SAML (Secured Assertion Markup Language) OR Web Services for user authentication to the system. 3.6

COTS Integration Capability

As identified under the COTS integration block in Figure: 1 iTRAK Integration Landscape, it is desired that the offered solution includes built-in interfaces with standard Federal interfaces that are used at NSF. A list of the standard Federal interfaces are identified in Table 3: Standard Federal Interfaces below. Currently these products are integrated using custom interfaces and NSF plans to retire them once the new iTRAK solution is implemented.

Bank Information Validation Service

4 System Requirements
Each business transaction should be processed in iTRAK and sent back to the NSF systems with 2 seconds on a near real-time scenario. In a near real-time scenario, upon failure to communicate the response to NSF systems, the system should make 5 consecutive tries within a duration of 60 seconds before throwing any exceptions. iTRAK should provide proper reconciliation reports for all business transaction through the interface. The interfaces should be available 24x7x365 except on planned outages. The interfaces should be able to support 50 concurrent transactions without performance degradation. Any planned outages should be notified to NSF at least 6 weeks in advance. All changes to the interfaces endpoints should be documented and communicated to NSF at least 8 weeks in advance. All production incidents should be responded with 2 hours. The incidents should be documented and communicated to NSF via proper communication channels and escalated to the IT Help Center. The data load from iTRAK to NSF staging area should happen on a daily basis (every 24 hours) or near/real time or on demand basis, Supporting documentation (data dictionary, data model) on the data should be provided to NSF. The data transport mechanism should be secured per FIPS 140-2.

FPPS Interface

File Formats - FTP Files that are provided: Labor Cost File (COSTFILE), Combined Data File (COMBFILE), Banking Info File (IFIL0131 ­ Incremental & IFIL0079 ­ Full), IPA Extract File (IPAEXT) Transmission : The data files are FTPd from DOI using a UNIX shell script The data files are parsed by FPPS application programs and stored in FPPSDB. Employee Biweekly and daily banking information is consolidated and updated through an interface. Flow of logic for Normalized loading: ˇ ControlM invokes a script that calls an executable java class that runs the Bank Info Normalized Loading interface. ˇ Retrieves all the records whose process status code is ,,01 from Labor Cost Staging table based on the batch Id. ˇ Validates the data and convert to the appropriate data type picking the data type from an xml file. ˇ Retrieves the existing record of the employees Bank Info with the SSN from Bank Info Normalized table. 11

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

Compares the existing record with the new record. If there is no change in the profile, the system ignores the record. If any change, the record is made expired and inserted with the new account particulars. Job start time, Job end time, Job result written to the Job process log table Error logs written to the Record error log table.

All the data files are parsed by FPPS application programs and stored in FPPSDB. Labor Cost data would be consolidated, and merged with NSF translations rules to form accounting transactions and would be posted into FAS system. Payroll accruals are posted manually using payroll transaction codes (TC 652, 654) by appropriation, program element and object class. The accrual is based on the pay period that will post immediately before the end of the quarter. At year end, additional amounts are accrued for terminal leave, intermittent consultants and overtime, as well as Presidential Rank awards (if signed by the President on or before 09/30).

DIS SDLC Guide

1. Overview
The SDLC defined here is the system development methodology of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Information Systems (DIS). It is based on a waterfall engineering process that describes who does what, when, and how in a system development and deployment project. It defines the SDLC in terms of phases, deliverables and artifacts. The SDLC is based on guidance from the NSF DIS Deputy Division Director and Branch Chiefs. The purpose of an SDLC methodology is to provide IT Project Managers with the tools to help ensure successful implementation of systems that satisfy NSF strategic and business objectives. The documentation provides a mechanism to ensure that executive leadership, functional managers and users sign-off on the requirements and implementation of the system. The process provides NSF managers and the Project Manager with the visibility of design, development, and implementation status needed to ensure delivery on time and within budget. 1.1 Introduction to This Guide This guide intends to help you understand the NSF DIS SDLC Process to follow when initiating and deploying systems/software at the NSF. This guide contains an overview of the SDLC process, high level activities and deliverables in each lifecycle phase, and instructions for how to tailor the SDLC process to fit your project's needs. After reading this guide, you will be able to:    Understand NSF DIS' SDLC process, Tailor the SDLC process to fit your project's needs, Find and download SDLC templates and procedures.

1.2 Background The National Science Foundation spends millions of dollars each year on the acquisition, design, development, implementation, and maintenance of systems vital to mission programs and administrative functions. The need to plan for and develop safe, secure, and reliable system solutions is heightened by an increasing dependence on technology to provide services, develop products, administer programs, and perform management functions. There is also a need to ensure privacy and security when developing information systems, to establish uniform privacy and protection practices, and to develop acceptable implementation strategies for these practices. The SDLC methodology is designed to satisfy these needs by establishing procedures, and practices governing the initiation, requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, operation, maintenance, enhancement, and eventual retirement of automated information systems. This SDLC methodology shall be used for all Major Development Projects which have been defined as meeting one or more of the following criteria: (1) The estimated total cost of full lifecycle activities equals or exceeds $500K; (2) The project is undertaken to support a critical business function associated with the grants management lifecycle or legislative mandates; or (3) The DIS Deputy Division Director determines that the project requires the special attention and consideration given to a major information technology development project. For upgrades or enhancements not designated as Major Development Projects, project teams are strongly encouraged to tailor and use the planning, requirements analysis, design, development, and testing documentation tools provided by the SDLC to support sound project management practices. 1.3 SDLC Phases The NSF SDLC describes important elements of software development in a common and consistent way. This process is broken down into seven phases. The NSF DIS SDLC provides a standard approach that results in the production of well documented, quality software.

DIS SDLC Guide

1.3.1 Tailoring the SDLC The concept of roadmaps was introduced to help projects tailor the SDLC to meet their requirements. The type of roadmap adopted will depend on the type of change being implemented. Major Enhancements, Enhancements for example, will require more assets and more planning for risk mitigation than a release made up of defects only. The DIS SDLC has defined five roadmaps for projects to select fr from om during the development life cycle. c The five roadmaps are: 1. New Development 2. Major Enhancements 3. Enhancements and Defects 4. Defects 5. Emergency The roadmaps listed above are to be used with the Roadmap Matrix. This matrix shows which assets should be created or updated for each phase se of the SDLC. The Roadmap Matrix also shows whom is responsible for creating/updating the assets, the review type that should be conducted for the asset, organizations that may participate in some of the reviews (QA, TaSS and NSF Release Engineers) and i if f a procedure or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) exists to provide guidance in developing the required asset for the selected Roadmap. A roadmap may be tailored to meet the needs of a project. If a required artifact is not needed for a particular
Page 2

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION

DIS SDLC Guide

project, justification must be provided in the Project Charter or Release Summary Document (RSD). The justification for not creating or updating an asset must be provided in the beginning of the project or after the project starts. If in the middle of the development life cycle a project determines that it will not be able to develop a required artifact for the roadmap selected, the Project Charter or RSD must be updated to reflect this change and approved. A more detailed description of the roadmaps can be found in the following sections. 1.3.1.1 New Development A New Development project is defined as being a brand new project that has never released its code to production. The purpose of a new development project is to create/deliver a new Information Technology (IT) solution to the production environment, for the first time, to meet a business need or solve a business problem. An example of a New Development project is launching a system for the first time. 1.3.1.2 Major Enhancements The Major Enhancements roadmap typically consists of enhancement Change Requests (CRs) only and it is for Operations and Maintenance (O&M) projects. The Enhancements roadmap is for projects that already have code in production. An Enhancement may be implemented to modernize, enhance or maintain an existing application. Major Enhancements may also include adding new modules to an existing application. An example of a Major Enhancement is the enhancement of the eJacket application to provide program staff with the ability to process a proposal from end-to-end in one application and in a paperless process (eJacket DD Concur). 1.3.1.3 Enhancements and Defects The Enhancements and Defects roadmap is geared towards releases consisting of CRs that are minor enhancements and defect fixes. This roadmap differs from the Enhancements only roadmap because it also includes defects and the enhancements are on a smaller scale. Major Enhancements should not follow this roadmap. Examples of minor enhancements include improvements to the user interface, adding security related features to online applications, adding functionality to calculate stipends, etc. 1.3.1.4 Defects The Defects roadmap is made up of defects only. A defect is defined as anything that adversely impacts the expected functionality of an application to the user, differs from the requirements, does not function as designed, or otherwise reduces the quality of an application that is in production. Defects fall under Corrective Maintenance which means the repair of identified faults or defects due to design, logic, or coding errors. 1.3.1.5 Emergencies The objective of the Emergencies roadmap is to address critical outages or loss of major functionality in an application within a short timeframe. This loss of major functionality in an application is caused by a defect and the highest priority becomes restoring the application to a fully operational state in as short of time possible. Any new functionality is not considered an emergency; therefore, all emergency requests are defects and not enhancements. An expedited CR process is used to address emergency defects. A request to fix an emergency must be approved. The fix to address the defect will be put into production as soon as it is properly tested. An update of the assets related to fixing the defect is performed after the fix has been implemented in the production environment. Approved emergency change requests allow a production deployment before all the supporting documentation is completed in order to minimize downtime and reduce impacts to application users. For example, the business analyst may update the requirements documentation after the production release. 1.3.2 Certification & Accreditation Criteria OMB A-130 defines a major application as an application that requires special attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. NSF categorizes its major applications as Low and Moderate. Currently, NSF does not have High Impact applications in its system inventory. This categorization is defined in FIPS-199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.
Page 3

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION

DIS SDLC Guide

The following criteria are used as guidance to determine if an application is a major application subject to management review:    The application performs financial transactions. The application functions in direct support of the NSF mission. The impact of the loss of system information to the NSF would be: - Moderate if the application's confidentiality, availability and integrity were compromised. Moderate Impact means the data's unauthorized disclosure would have a serious adverse effect on the NSF's reputation or interest. A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant degradation in mission capability; (ii) result in significant damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life threatening injuries. - Low if the application data's confidentiality, availability and integrity were compromised. In this situation, a Low Impact means the loss of the data's confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect on NSF. A limited adverse effect means (i) a degradation in mission capability; (ii) result in minor damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in minor financial loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals. The application could continue to operate at a remote location should the application's processing environment at NSF become inoperable. NSF major applications are part of the NSF annual Service Recovery testing.



NIST Special Publication 800-37 defines a minor application as an application, other than a major application, that requires attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application. NSF's minor applications inherit the security controls and protection measures of the NSF Network and Central Computer Facility (CCF). The NSF Network and CCF is certified and accredited every three years using NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, security controls. NSF reviews the applications technical security controls during the years a C&A is not required.

2. Reviews
2.1 Artifact Reviews Each artifact should go through a review process prior to being approved. Reviews include project team peer reviews, quality assurance reviews, and reviews with various NSF stakeholders. Peer reviews are an important part of the SDLC process and can save a significant amount of effort and cost when deficiencies are caught early in the lifecycle when they are the least expensive to fix. Appendix A lists the reviews required for each artifact by lifecycle phase prior to the management gate reviews. 2.2 Management Gate Reviews Management Gate Reviews are held at various points throughout the SDLC to ensure compliance with the NSF DIS SDLC policies and procedures and to ensure that the project is on time, within scope, and within budget. The figure below outlines the major management gate reviews, the contents to be reviewed, and the approvals required in order to proceed to the next phase. The project teams will determine in the initiation phase and agree with DIS leadership which gate reviews are required for the project. Figure 2: NSF DIS Management Gate Reviews

4. Appendix A: SDLC Artifacts by Phase and Required Reviews
Artifacts are the tools or "vehicle" used to support the needed work. Each phase of the process has artifacts that are associated with it (i.e. the Project Concept Briefing, Test Plan, etc.). These artifacts should not be viewed as sequential stepping stones in the development process, but rather, living documents that are open to modification throughout the entire life cycle. For example, the Project Concept document is among the first artifacts to be produced and reviewed by the project stakeholders, but it may need to be updated later in the Design phase when certain changes in direction may become necessary. The content provided in the SDLC artifacts is essential to the success of the project. As such, these project artifacts may be subjected to the Quality Assurance process. Individual sections should not be removed from the artifacts; however, additional data may be added based on the needs of the project. Each artifact should go through a review process prior to being approved. The table below lists the reviews required for each artifact by lifecycle phase prior to the management gate reviews.

Contractor personnel may be required to participate in NSF' Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) process. The CIRT is a very important part of security. If there is a serious security incident involving malicious software, a virus or hack into a system that results in the loss of availability, integrity or confidentiality of NSF data, a team consisting of NSF's IT Security Officer (and others) and the vendor's security or operations team must meet to remediate and report the issue. This is called the Computer Incident Response Team and is essential for system security. NSF needs to be informed of any "incident" that potentially affects NSF data. NSF must work closely with the vendor to resolve the issue.

NSF Requirement

SLA-08-01-07

The contractor shall provide assurance that the proper security practices are in place. NSF will periodically scan the applicable systems for vulnerabilities. NSF will provide two weeks' notice prior to any scans, and will supply the Contractor with the results. Should the scan identify unremediated vulnerabilities, the Contractor will treat the remediation activities as an urgent change, however no additional charge to NSF will apply, as routine remediation falls under standard system maintenance.

C.8 NSF 020 AUTHORITY OF GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL (OCT 2011) Contracting Officer The Contracting Officer (CO) is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract. Notwithstanding any clause contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the CO. In the event the Contractor effects any change at the direction of any person other than the CO, including any change beyond the scope of authority given to the duly authorized Contracting Officer's Technical Representative identified in the contract, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in charges incurred as a result thereof. The CO has the authority to perform any and all post-award functions in administering and enforcing this contract in accordance with its terms and conditions. Contracting Officer's Technical Representative The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), is responsible for administering the performance of work under this contract. IN NO EVENT, however, will any understanding, agreement, modification, change order, or other matter deviating from the terms of this contract be effective or binding upon the Government unless formalized by proper contractual documents executed by the CO prior to initiation of changed work. The COTR may give technical direction to the Contractor that fills in details, requires pursuit of certain lines of inquiry, or otherwise serves to facilitate the Contractor's compliance with the contract. To be valid, technical direction by the COTR must be consistent with the general scope of work set forth in this contract; may not constitute new assignment of work nor change be expressed terms, conditions or specifications of this
Page 11

contract; and shall not constitute a basis for any increase in the contract estimated cost, or extension to the contract delivery schedule. In the event any Government technical direction is considered by the Contractor to fall within the clause of this Contract entitled "Changes", the Contractor shall not implement such direction, but shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of such interpretation immediately after the Contractor's receipt of such direction and prior to the initiation of what the Contractor interprets to be changed work. Such notice shall: - include the reasons upon which the Contractor bases its belief that the technical direction falls within the purview of the "Changes" clause; and - include the Contractor's best estimate as to the revision of the current estimated cost, fee, performance time, delivery schedules or any other contractual provision that would result from implementing the changed work.

Page 12

2. The Contractor is responsible for its employees' conduct and establishing in - and out-processing procedures that ensure accomplishment of the actions identified in this clause. 3. Contractor personnel assigned to work at NSF facilities may be issued a Federal identity card and/or NSF building access card that permits their entrance to NSF facilities without going through visitor access processes. Contractor personnel may also be granted certain other privileges such as NSF e-mail accounts and/or access to NSF information systems. This access shall be provided solely at the discretion of the NSF, and may be revoked or withdrawn at any time, without notice or cause, by the Contracting Officer. 4. Contractor personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to systems operated by a Contractor for the NSF or interconnected to a NSF network shall be investigated at an appropriate level. Contractor personnel requiring routine physical access to NSF facilities for more than six months require a Federal identity card and NSF building access card and shall be investigated (i.e., a National Agency Check with Inquiries or higher level investigation). The FBI National Criminal History Check must be completed, and the investigation must be scheduled by OPM, before the cards are issued. NSF shall submit the National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) (or higher level) investigation to OPM using the standard personnel investigation forms listed in this clause. Contractors are required to report to the NSF Human Resource Management (HRM) Security Office during business hours to be electronically fingerprinted, inputted into the online Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (eQIP) system and provide other required documents to begin the investigations process. The Contractor shall submit the required forms to the NSF HRM Security Office within five (5) days after award or assignment of an individual to a position requiring investigation. a. Guidance for selecting the appropriate level of investigation is based on the risk of adverse impact to the NSF. The levels of risk for which investigation is required is as follows (IT-1 has the highest level of risk): i. IT-1 -- Individuals having privileged access or limited privileged access to systems whose misuse can cause very serious adverse impact to NSF programs. ii. IT-2 -- Individuals having privileged access or limited privileged access to systems whose misuse can cause significant adverse impact to NSF programs. These systems include, for example, those that interconnect with a NSF network in a way that exceeds access by the general public, such as bypassing firewalls; and systems operated by a Contractor for the NSF whose function or data has substantial cost to replace, even if these systems are not interconnected with a NSF network. b. Investigation for individuals shall employ forms appropriate for the level of risk as follows: i. IT-1: Electronic fingerprints, online Standard Form (SF) 85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, Federal Employment and resume. ii. IT-2: Electronic and Standard Form (SF) 85P Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Official Form (OF) 306 Declaration for Federal Employment, Credit Report Notice Form and resume. c. Investigation of Contractor personnel may be waived by the HRM Security Office for individuals in cases where proof of prior investigation at the NACI or higher level within the last two years can be obtained.

Page 13

d. Until favorable results are received from the FBI National Criminal History Check and OPM has scheduled an investigation, NSF will not issue a Federal identity card and NSF building access card. Contractors will use the temporary visitor badge. 5. The Contractor shall ensure that its employees, in performance of the contract, receive initial IT Security Awareness Training before being granted access to NSF systems and networks, and receive refresher IT Security Awareness Training annually. The Contractor may use web-based training available from the NSF to meet this requirement. 6. The Contractor shall ensure that its employees, in performance of the contract, sign and submit the "National Science Foundation (NSF) Information System Access Rules of Behavior" before being granted access to NSF systems and networks. 7. The Contractor shall be responsible for Information Technology security for all systems used in performance of this contract, or those which are connected to a NSF network. This clause is applicable to all or any part of the contract that includes information technology resources or services in which the Contractor must have physical or electronic access to NSF's information, including sensitive information and personally identifiable information, contained in unclassified systems that directly support the mission of the Agency. This includes information technology, hardware, software, and the management, operation, maintenance, programming, and system administration of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications systems. 8. The provider of information technology shall certify applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC). The FDCC common security configurations are available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Web site at http://checklists.nist.gov . a. The standard installation, operation, maintenance, update, and/or patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the approved FDCC configuration. b. Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges. 9. In the course of performing official duties, Contractors may have the need to access sensitive information or personally identifiable information (PII). Sensitive information includes personally identifiable information and sensitive NSF information such as proposal review, reviewer identity tied to reviews, unfunded proposals, proprietary parts of funded proposal; and other similar information. The majority of sensitive information maintained by NSF is in systems of records protected under the Privacy Act sensitive data. Sensitive information may also exist in other types of records, such as databases, log files, e-mail, and correspondence files. All Contractor personnel are responsible for recognizing sensitive information and avoiding inappropriate or accidental access, use, or disclosure in accordance with NSF IT policies. a. Personally identifiable information (PII) refers to information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc., alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, etc. All Contractor personnel are responsible for recognizing personally identifiable information and avoiding inappropriate or accidental access, use, or disclosure in accordance with NSF IT policies.
Page 14

10. The Contractor must not use or redistribute any NSF information processed, stored, or transmitted by the Contractor except as specified in the Contract. 11. For Information Systems NSF has identified as Major Applications or General Support Systems (GSS) that are not connected to a NSF network, but for which the Contractor has operational responsibility on behalf of NSF, the Contractor must provide, implement and maintain an IT System Security Plan (SSP). The IT SSP must provide an overview of the security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements to ensure appropriate security of the information system resources and data that are developed, processed, or used under this Contract. The IT SSP must comply with OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and recommendations in the NIST Special Publication 800-18. a. Within 30 days after Contract award, the Contractor must submit the IT SSP to the NSF Contracting Officer for acceptance. b. Within 60 days after Contract award, the Contractor must submit written proof of IT Security accreditation to the NSF Contracting Officer. Accreditation must be in accordance with NSF policies, procedures and guidance. In accordance with NIST SP 800-37, this accreditation package must include a final IT SSP, security assessment report and a plan of action and milestones and a disaster recovery/contingency plan. c. On an annual basis, the Contractor must submit verification to the Contracting Officer that the IT SSP remains valid. 12. The Contractor shall afford the NSF, including the Office of Inspector General, access to the Contractor's and subcontractors' facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases and personnel used in performance of the contract. Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection, investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of NSF data or to the function of computer systems operated on behalf of the NSF, and to preserve evidence of computer crime. 13. At any time during the term of this contract or task orders issued hereunder, Contractor personnel issued a Federal identity card and NSF building access card, or granted access to NSF e-mail or any other NSF information system, that do not require any further access, and/or at completion, expiration or termination of any such contract or task order where access has been granted, SHALL; a. Complete and submit the online Contractor/Guest Exit Form, which will result in termination of all access to any NSF e-mail accounts and information systems. b. Report to the second floor guard station (located outside Room 225), identify themselves to the personnel present, and surrender their Federal identity card and NSF building access card. c. Notify the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and appropriate Property Custodian of any NSF equipment to be surrendered to NSF. 14. Contractor personnel will be considered not to require access to NSF facilities for work performance upon expiration of this contract or task orders issued hereunder. 15. The Contractor shall incorporate the substance of this clause in all subcontracts.

Page 20

the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. NSF may, however, terminate the contract for convenience if it deems such termination to be in the best interest of the Government. (2) In the event that the contractor was aware of facts required to be disclosed or the existence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and did not disclose such facts or such conflict of interest to the Contracting Officer, NSF may terminate this contract for default. (d) Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, including the existence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest at the time of or after award, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify the contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Waiver. Requests for waiver under this clause shall be directed in writing to the NSF Office of General Counsel and a copy provided to the Contracting Officer, and shall include a full description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support of the request. If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the Contracting Officer may grant such a waiver in writing. (f) Subcontracts. (1) The contractor shall include a clause, substantially similar to this clause, including this paragraph (f), in subcontracts expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold in FAR Part 13. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (2) Prior to the award under this contract of any such subcontracts for advisory and assistance services, the contractor shall obtain from the proposed subcontractor or consultant a disclosure of all existing or potential organizational conflicts of interest and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present a significant potential for an organizational conflict of interest. Where an actual or significant potential organizational conflict of interest is identified, the contractor shall take actions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the organizational conflict to the satisfaction of the contractor. If the conflict cannot be avoided or neutralized, the contractor must obtain the approval of the NSF Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine the realism of the proposed subcontracting goals and the likelihood of successful accomplishment of the goals.

Page 50

The Extent of Participation of Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns Factor shall be evaluated using the "meets/fails to meet" criteria. E.10 SOURCE SELECTION The source selection decision will be based on a Best Value tradeoff determination. Contractors are required to submit all technical and business proposals to the NSF Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) by the specified time and date as indicated in the RFP to be considered for an award. NSF intends to evaluate proposals and make an award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. NSF will make an award to the responsible contractor or Federal entity whose offer conforms to the RFP, has no deficiencies, and is most advantageous to the Government, with price and other factors considered. For this procurement, proposed pricing will be considered in an award determination. However, factors such as Technical, Management Approach, and Past Performance when considered together are significantly more important than cost or price. The Contracting Officer will determine whether the difference in technical quality and past performance is worth the difference price. E.11 NSF 140 NSF ACQUISITION OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2011) (a) An NSF Acquisition Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the contracting officer, selection official, or contracting officer's technical representative. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with the NSF Acquisition Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the NSF Acquisition Ombudsman. The contact information for the NSF Acquisition Ombudsman may be found at http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/DACS/ombud.jsp. (d) The NSF Acquisition Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the NSF Acquisition Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

(f) The Office of the National Ombudsman of the U.S. Small Business Administration has asked all Federal agencies to make clear that, if a small business entity requests Ombudsman assistance on a matter or otherwise questions or complains about a Federal agency action, the agency will not retaliate in response. The National Science Foundation is committed to maintaining an environment in which small businesses and others are free to question or complain about NSF actions or policies without fear of retaliation. One of the statutory responsibilities of the NSF, through its Office of Small Business Research and Development, is to "assure the expeditious processing of proposals by small business concerns based on scientific and technical merit" [42 U.S.C. 1883(3)]. Any allegations of retaliation will be investigated and appropriate action taken to correct the situation and ensure it is not repeated. In addition, small business entities may comment to the National Ombudsman's office. Information about the National Ombudsman is available by visiting www.sba.gov/ombudsman.

4.0 System Acceptance
The system shall be accepted with no severity 1 & 2 issues. Negligible Severity 3 issues (below 2% of total system transactions) and severity 4 &5 (below 5%). Explanation on each severity level: Severity 1 - Catastrophic defect that causes total failure of the software or unrecoverable data loss. There is no work around. In general, a severity 1 defect would prevent the product from being released. Example: defects that cause the system to crash, corrupt data files, or completely disrupt service. Severity 2 - Defect results in severely impaired functionality. A work around may exist but its use is unsatisfactory. In general, you would not release the product with such a defect. Examples: with certain steps, we may generate a Windows error/message that you can click Ok on and continue with whatever you were doing with no harmful effects. Severity 3 - Defect causes failure of non-critical aspects of the system. There is a reasonably satisfactory work around. The product may be released if the defect is documented, but the existence of the defect may cause customer dissatisfaction. Example: a non Client Financial Report is not recognizing an option correctly, but if a filter is set, the report can be generated with the proper output. Severity 4 - Defect of minor significance. A work around exists or, if not, the impairment is slight. Generally, the product could be released and most customers would be unaware of the defect's existence or only slightly dissatisfied. Example: A button or button set is slightly off center on a data screen, or the problem is purely cosmetic and not easily recognizable. Severity 5 - Enhancement request or design issue. These should probably be coded as Suggestions or brought to the Design Team by the originating person's DT representative.
