STATEMENT OF WORK

U.S. Department of Labor Office of the Chief Information Officer Request for Proposal Department of Labor Enterprise Architecture Program Office Program Support

Dated October 28, 2009

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Background With the passage of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, Congress required Federal Agency Chief Information Officers to develop, maintain, and facilitate integrated systems architectures. Additionally, OMB has issued guidance that requires agency information systems investments to be consistent with Federal, Agency and bureau architectures. Similarly, the Chief Information Officer Council, the Department of the Treasury, the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST), and the General Accountability Office (GAO), have developed architecture frameworks or models that define the content of enterprise architectures. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Chief Information Officer (CIO) position was established by the Secretary of Labor in 2000 as a result of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. The mission of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is to provide leadership, policy, guidance and assistance to Departmental agencies in all aspects of using information technology (IT) to implement and manage programs within the Department. The Departmental Labor Management Series Volume 9, Chapter 500 (Enterprise Architecture) establishes authorities and responsibilities for the DOL Chief Architect and EA Program Office. The DOL Chief Architect is responsible for: 1. Departmental EA Management through the EA Program Office, which includes: a. Developing EA processes, procedures and standards based on guidance issued by the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (FEA-PMO) and other guidance issued by the Federal CIO Council, OMB, and GAO; b. Developing and implementing the DOL-wide baseline and target architectures that align with and/or incorporate solutions from the FEA; and, c. Establishing and implementing EA Governance that integrates with the Performance Improvement Lifecycle, Budget Planning and Execution, IT Capital Planning and Investment Control Process (CPIC), IT Security, and the Department's System Development Life Cycle Methodology (SDLCM). 2. Providing a forum for agencies to exchange information about what practices are and are not effective for developing and maintaining a sound EA. 3. Ensuring that quality assurance, risk management, and configuration management, as defined in DOL management practices, are applied to DOL EA artifacts, models and documents. 4. Conducting selected evaluations of DOL's EA, including models, diagrams, definitions, products, schemas, process mappings, methods, policies, handbooks, tools, metrics or assessments. 5. Assisting agencies with aligning their EA targets with the DOL Segments and FEA reference models and framework. 6. Consulting with appropriate DOL offices on statutory responsibilities to review, approve, or certify elements of the EA. For example, provide guidance to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer on assuring compliance of all financial systems and related interfaces. 7. Issuing additional policies, procedures, and guidance through other documents such as, but not limited to, the DOL Enterprise Architecture Handbook. The EA Program Office seeks to improve and mature the Agency-wide roadmap to achieve an Agency's mission through optimal performance of its core business processes within an efficient information technology (IT) environment. The 14

primary goal of the EA is to inform, guide, and constrain the decisions for the enterprise, especially those related to IT investments. The EA program within the OCIO focuses on business transformation based on strategic planning through the Enterprise Architecture. The EA Program Office will also enhance its integration with other governance areas such as IT Capital Planning and Investment, Budget Formulation and Execution, Performance Management and Information Security. The Enterprise Architecture process within the U.S. Department of Labor adheres to Performance Improvement Lifecycle of "Architect" ­ Invest ­ Implement. Each lifecycle phase is comprised of tightly integrated processes that combine to transform the agency's top-down strategic goals and bottom-up system needs into a logical series of work products designed to help the agency achieve strategic results. Through practice area integration, the Performance Improvement Lifecycle provides the foundation for sound information and IT management practices, end-to-end governance of IT investments, and alignment of IT investments with an agency's strategic goals. Architect focuses mainly on the quality of DOL's organization's products, services, and business processes, and on the agility of the enterprise in implementing changing business, IT, and organizational strategies. This phase of the performance improvement life-cycle will leverage the Federal Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM) and DOL Governance processes to maximize business value and align technology and IT strategies.. DOL's Enterprise Architecture describes the current (baseline) and future (target) states of the agency, and the plan to transition from the current to the future state, with a focus on agency strategy, program performance improvements and information technology investments. Agency EAs are organized by segments and/or core mission areas (e.g., Worker Safety), business service (e.g., financial management, human resources), and enterprise services (e.g., Information Technology Infrastructure). Segments are defined using the Federal Segment Architecture Methodology and DOL Governance models. The DOL Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP) identifies a desired set of business and IT capabilities needed to reach the target enterprise architecture. It also defines risk, constraints and logical dependencies between transition activities (programs and investments) and helps to define the relative priority and sequencing of these activities. To achieve the target performance improvements, the DOL EA Program must enhance it EA to support Segment-based Architectures and tighter integration with the DOL's performance, budget, acquisition, and capital planning and investment control (CPIC) processes as well as the (solution) that is managed through the DOL System Development Life-Cycle (SDLC). OMB Circular A-130 states, "Agencies must establish and maintain a capital planning and investment control process that links mission needs, information, and information technology in an effective and efficient manner. The process will guide both strategic and operational IRM, IT planning, and the enterprise architecture by integrating the agency's IRM plans, strategic and performance plans, financial management plans and the agency's budget formulation and execution processes. Invest: Performance improvement opportunities identified during the "Architect" process are addressed through DOL's portfolio of IT investments. This step defines the implementation and funding strategy for individual initiatives identified in the Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP) and described in the segment architectures. During this step of the Performance Improvement Lifecycle, DOL initiates its select and evaluation phase of the IT Capital Planning process to ensure its investments are aligned, via high priority segments, to agency strategic goals and objectives. The prioritization is further refined to reflect additional opportunities for cost savings and avoidance, as well as other approaches to agency performance improvement. Implement: Projects are executed and tracked throughout the system development life cycle (SDLC). Achievement of the program / project plan within acceptable variance for schedule and budget is measured and reported through the Earned Value Management (EVM) process. Performance is measured to determine how well the implemented solutions achieve the desired (process) outputs and mission outcomes, and provide feedback into the enterprise and segment architecture development processes as well as the cyclical strategic planning process. Measure, Assess and Improve The Architect, Invest and Implement activities are a major component of DOL's Enterprise Architecture Program to implement effective controls and oversight, which is critical for ensuring EA program success. Through this process, information is gathered for accountable decision makers to permit awareness of whether effective EA development, 15

implementation, and maintenance activities are being performed and the EA program goals are being met on schedule and within budgets. The "Architect" phase must be adopted by DOL Agencies as the first phase of the Performance Improvement Life-cycle rather than the last phase. The DOL EA Program continuously measures and assesses programs in the context of agency missions and outcomeoriented results defined in the enterprise-wide performance architecture. To achieve this objective, agency performance improvement plans and priorities, including the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) and Performance Assessment Report (PAR) must be reflected in the DOL EA and ETP. PAR metrics and measures provide specific measures on agency mission performance, and often monitor and regulate agency strategy in support the PART evaluation process so it is a critical component of the EA Performance Framework. Control activities focus on "Quarterly Control Reviews" and biannual Enterprise Architecture Assessments that leverage the DOL EA Framework and latest releases of the OMB Enterprise Architecture Assessment Framework and the General Accountability's Enterprise Architecture Maturity Model Framework. The DOL EA Program participates in CPIC Select, Control and Evaluate processes with evaluation of over 130 major and non-major IT investment totaling about $600 million in FY 2009 and included in DOL's IT portfolio. The DOL EA Program manages over 40 Segments comprised of 160+ projects some that are still in the "Notional" or "Planned" phase. The DOL EA Program must move towards a shared target vision for its key segments that include 1) Core Mission (focus on interoperability, and information sharing); 2) Business Services (shared segment architectures and service reuse); 3) Enterprise Services (focus on standards, policies, service reuse or via Cloud Computing). Quarterly Reporting OMB collects a significant amount of IT investment data and other related data from executive agencies during each phase of Performance Improvement Lifecycle. OMB officials use this information to guide the development of an efficient and effective IT investment portfolio as a part of the President's budget request to Congress. Within OMB, the Office of E-Government and Information Technology considers a variety of different data sources and inputs in the analysis of proposed IT investments. One of these sources is the Agency EA submission, plans and milestones. Recently, OMB has modified the EA reporting and assessment cycle for better alignment with Agency strategic planning and mission performance improvement, capital planning and investment control (CPIC), and results reporting. As a result, Starting in the FY 09 cycle, OMB will assess Agency EA Completion in the 3rd fiscal quarter; assess Use in the 4th fiscal quarter, and assess Results in the 1st fiscal quarter. OMB will continue to provide feedback with each submission and assessment, and will increase our emphasis on identifying and communicating opportunities for agencies to collaborate on developing and reusing core mission (i.e., Federal Information Sharing), business service (i.e., Financial Management, IT Infrastructure), or enterprise service (i.e., Identity Management) segment architectures. The Enterprise Architecture Segment Report is integral to the OMB EA Assessment process. Therefore agencies are directed to submit a segment report for each of the segments registered with OMB, even if the segments are identified as "notional". These segment reports are required to be updated on a quarterly basis, as the segment develops and matures. Completeness of the report will depend on the maturity of the segment. Completed segments will have more thoroughly populated EASR, while notional segments will only contain descriptive information. DOL will provide updated segment reports on a quarterly basis or as directed by OMB. These updates will reflect the additional information available as segment maturity progresses (e.g., from Planned to In-Progress). The DOL EASR should include any new transition milestones demonstrating progress in segment maturity along with any new information (such as performance metrics). The DOL EASR provides a template for reporting on several aspects of a segment's maturity that are in compliance with the four segment maturity levels as defined by OMB:

16

ˇ Notional ­ Notional segments are the lowest level of maturity, denoting a conceptual view and require only limited information. ˇ Planned ­ Planned segments have additional information on the segment mappings, but may not include extensive performance milestones, or reusable objects. ˇ In-Progress ­ In-Progress segments are in the process of being architected and should complete a majority of the segment report, but may not have information on Collaboration and Reuse within the segment. ˇ Complete ­ Completed segments are approved by the mission or business owner and agencies are required to complete all worksheets and associated attributes of the segment report, in addition to a signature page. DOL anticipates that this guidance will be updated on a quarterly basis. 1.1 Scope

The scope of this program encompasses all areas of interaction with the DOL EA. This includes, but is not limited to: Capital Planning & Investment Control (CPIC), System Development Life-Cycle (SDLC), Portfolio Management, Strategic and Transition Planning, Security, Data and Technology Standards and Program Management and Governance.

Task 3: EA Transition and Strategic Planning Description The Contractor shall analyze and implement enhancements to the DOL Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP) Framework to identify and articulate the resources, timelines, and approach necessary to successfully achieve the Department's vision and strategic goals as defined in the DOL Consolidated Target Enterprise Architectures based on legislative guidance. This framework shall focus on demonstrating the results of analyses of DOL processes, identifying areas needing improvement, and determining how these needs are being addressed. The three component areas used to carry out this plan include: 1) Current Architecture 2) Target Vision and Direction, and 3) Performance Gap Analysis. The framework shall further demonstrate how business needs drive the Information Technology (IT) direction at the Department. Further development and use of this framework shall provide the Department with a map for discovering and resolving the following issues: Effective identification and use of resources available to the Department (or those that will be available in the future) including federal employees, hardware, software (COTS/GOTS), data, and related resources and how to account for them financially; Critical issues/risk factors that need to be addressed before transition can be contemplated, planned, and executed (i.e., operating deficiencies, governance, stakeholder involvement, leadership, performance measures, communications, financial management, resource development, etc); and Developing an actionable transition plan to identify activities, tasks, milestones and/or other performance measures, necessary to achieve business objectives in an efficient and timely manner.

40

In addition to this framework, the Contractor shall develop guidance to assist agencies in development of individual Enterprise Transition Plans through the Departmental Enterprise Architecture Management System and providing standardized products and reports. The individual plans shall address all aspects of transition activities for each DOL component agency's business functions. Each plan includes a business function description, a target architecture summary detailing what functionality and goals will be met in the target state, a transition plan summary, an alternative analysis summary, a gap analysis, assumptions and constraints, performance goals and measures, and risk mitigation strategies. The DOL Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office (DOL-EAPMO) will use these plans to measure performance against project milestones and deliverables for meeting business objectives during Quarterly Quality Program Reviews and to meet OMB and/or GAO reporting requirements.

Desired Outcomes, Performance Standards and Surveillance Plans Desired Outcome DOL and Agency Enterprise Transition Plans Define the detailed process by which each agency/Initiative will achieve transition to its target state Performance Standard / Acceptable Quality Level 90% of project milestones align with the DOL SDLCM, define each step in the evolution of the system/Initiative, setting the business, technological, or organizational goals. 100% of Agency ETPs identify options and coordinate dependencies. Changes are analyzed to determine those that are natural prerequisites for each other. This identifies what will have to be done first or at least in parallel, regardless of the transition path chosen. Some of these options may be identified and/or analyzed through workshops to obtain stakeholder buy-in. A key part of orchestrating the dependencies is to identify and prioritize benefits and retain as much flexibility as possible. D.I.R.T Analysis: Decommission Interface, Integrate, Re-engineer, and Transition (D.I.R.T) analysis is used for determining the final disposition of baseline applications that have functionality similar to the target application, and are affected by its Transition.

53

(1) Services accepted. Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-- (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-- 54

(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. (1) Other direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert `None'."] (2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert `None'."]

(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):

55

(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-- (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-- (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall-- (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-- (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6) (i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-- (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or 56

(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-- (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.

(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. 57

(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (j) Risk of loss. Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon: (1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or (2) Delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, if transportation is f.o.b. destination. (k) Taxes. The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties. (l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 59

52.232-7 PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS (FEB 2007) The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative: (a) Hourly rate. (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are-- (i) Performed by the Contractor; (ii) Performed by the Subcontractors; or (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliated of the Contractor under a common control. (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor hours performed. (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (5) Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting Officer or authorized representative. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by-- (i) Individual daily job timekeeping records; (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer. 67

(6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative. (7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a), but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause. (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (b) Materials. (1) For the purposes of this clause-- (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. (ii) Materials means-- (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); and (D) Applicable indirect costs. (2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (i) Quantities being acquired; and (ii) Actual cost of any modification necessary because of contract requirements. (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials provided the Contractor-- (i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract. (5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are-- (i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate; (ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and 68

(iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates. (6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-(i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government. (7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials. (c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at the sole discretion of the Government. (d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the invoices or vouchers and supporting documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the "completion voucher" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms of paragraph (g) of this section), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the 69

Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. (g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions: (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor. (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. (h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services. (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act. (2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due date. (i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (j) The terms of this clause that govern reimbursement for materials furnished are considered to have been deleted. (End of Clause)

52.232-19 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR (APR 1984)
Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond January 31, 2011. The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond January 31, 2011, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

52.239-1 PRIVACY OR SECURITY SAFEGUARDS (Aug. 1996)

(a) The Contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the Contracting Officer's written consent, the details of any safeguards either designed or developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise provided by the Government. (b) To the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to safeguard against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government data, the Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor's facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases. (c) If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the Government or the Contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party.

Each offeror shall provide the past performance questionnaire located in Section D ­ Attachment 1 to all commercial and government agencies, which they will be submitting as references for past performance history. Offerors shall have each commercial or Government agency submit the completed questionnaire to the individual and address listed on the questionnaire to arrive no later than 15 calendar days before the solicitation closing date. The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the CO reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. The Government intends to evaluate the proposals and award a contract, without discussions with the offerors, unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The offeror shall electronically complete the Representations, Certifications and other Statements of Offeror's via the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov)

52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) Technical Capability; (ii) Past Performance; (iii) Price. Technical Capability and Past Performance are of equal importance and, when combined, are significantly more important than price when being evaluated. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The total price offered (base year, option period(s), and optional services offered, will be used as the overall evaluated price). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision) ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) Basis for Award: The Government will award a single Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the three evaluation factors: {Technical, Past Performance, and Price}. Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance. All sub-factors under Factor I, Technical are of equal importance. The Contracting Officer shall also conduct a price analysis in accordance with the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Factor III, Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, and its associated sub-factors (Understanding of Requirement, Key Personnel, Corporate Experience, Start-up and Phase-out Plan, and Quality Control Plan). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers: The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to 77

Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. Correction Potential of Proposals: The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency or uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an Offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range Pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for reasons of efficiency. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f) (4), the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Offerors will be required to submit a technical and price proposal and will be evaluated against three evaluation factors. To determine which firm represents the best value, the offers will be evaluated as outlined below. FACTOR I-TECHNICAL: Sub-factor 1- UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT ­ The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated. Sub-factor 2- PERSONNEL - The Government will evaluate the experience and qualifications of all contractor personnel, to include resumes for key personnel identified in paragraphs 1.17 of the SOW and also provide a matrix to include the background/experience of the company's proposed personnel mapped to the appropriate SOW tasking that supports the proposed labor category and level. Sub-factor 3 ­ CORPORATE EXPERIENCE - The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience with work of a similar nature, scope, complexity, and difficulty to that which will be performed under the prospective contract contemplated by this solicitation. Sub-factor 4 ­ START-UP AND PHASE OUT PLAN - The Government will evaluate the Start-Up Plan which should contain a reasonable, realistic approach for assuming full contractual responsibility without disruption or degradation of performance. The plan shall identify risk, propose appropriate mitigation strategies, proposes a realistic, achievable and affordable start-up schedule and staffing plan. The plan shall ensure sufficient resources are on hand and available to begin work under this requirement. It shall include a statement that the personnel proposed are available, trained, and qualified to perform the work under this effort. In addition the government will evaluate the Phase-Out Plan submitted by the offeror based on how it demonstrates the offeror's ability to enable a smooth transition to replacement services when the contract period of performance ends. The plan shall provide phase-in support for up to 90 days to the selected contractor if the incumbent contractor is not selected herein. Contractors are required to submit their staffing plan with their proposal or their proposal will be considered nonresponsive. Sub-factor 5: QUALITY CONTROL PLAN - The Government will evaluate how the offeror intends to monitor, inspect, and correct deficiencies for the requirements of the SOW. The Government shall incorporate the QCP in the contract that will result from this solicitation. The QCP will no longer be considered proprietary and will be considered releasable under FOIA. FACTOR II - PAST PERFORMANCE: Each Past Performance questionnaire received will be scored as described in the questionnaire. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's past performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation, in terms of scope, size and magnitude. 78



The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and government personnel knowledge of offeror's past performance, to assess past performance. Offeror shall provide a list of no more than three (3) of the most relevant contracts performed for the Federal government within the last 3 years. The evaluation of past performance information may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, offeror shall provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contracts. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.





Past Performance on Similar Programs The offeror will provide a list of at least three references from recent programs/projects which are the same or similar, in nature and complexity, to the work described in the SOW. Past performance on contracts that are the same or similar to the work described within this SOW will be given more weight than those that are dissimilar to the statement of work. The Government reserves the right to contact offeror's references and shall at its discretion contact other sources to make inquiries related to past performance. For past performance references, the offeror must include: Names and Addresses of the government Agency A summary of the performance illustrating clear linkages with the SOW Period of performance Name and valid telephone number and email address of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. e. Quality of product or service f. Timeliness of performance g. Cost control h. Business practices i. Customer (end user) satisfaction; and j. Key Personnel past performance. The past performance evaluation will be accomplished through assignment of a confidence assessment rating on a combination of recency, relevancy, reliability and quality of performance. Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the Technical Ability/Approach sub factors, the resulting Performance Confidence Assessment is made at the factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an Offeror's present and past work record to assess the Government's confidence in the Offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services that meet the user's needs, including but not limited to, controlling costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspects of performance), and performance (reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customer). As a result of an analysis, each Offeror will receive an integrated Performance Confidence Assessment rating, which is the rating for the Past Performance factor. Proposals with no past performance information will not be rated favorably or unfavorably. See FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv). In performing the past performance evaluation, each Offeror will be assigned one of the following ratings described below in Table 2-1. a. b. c. d.

79

Table 2-1 - PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT RATINGS
RATING HIGH CONFIDENCE SIGNIFICANT CONFIDENCE

DESCRIPTION
Based on the Offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

SATISFACTORY Based on the Offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. CONFIDENCE Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE LITTLE CONFIDENCE NO CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable. Based on the Offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

This factor will be evaluated on the basis of information obtained concerning the Offerors' performance on contracts consistent in scope and complexity with the project that were performed during the last three years. Past performance information will be obtained through questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of this acquisition. The Offeror will send out a Past Performance Questionnaire (see Attachment L-4). Their selected references must return it to the Contracting Officer via fax or email as instructed on the questionnaire. Offerors are to note that, in conducting this assessment, the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by the Offeror and data obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to: Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or similar systems of other Government departments and agencies; Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA); interviews with program managers and Contracting Officers, and other sources known to the Government, including commercial sources. This information may include data on efforts performed by other divisions, critical subcontractors, or teaming contractors, if such resources will be brought to bear or significantly influence the performance of the proposed effort. The Government may consider as relevant efforts performed for agencies of the federal, state, or local governments and commercial customers. Offerors shall provide information about five (5) of their previous/current contracts or task orders that are most relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Past performance information to be evaluated will include the Offerors' records of providing high-quality services; standards of good technical and analytic workmanship; adherence to contract schedules; administrative aspects of contract performance; quality, availability and stability of personnel and commitment to customer's mission/goals. The evaluation will be constrained to the most recent and relevant contracts for a comprehensive review. Recent: In order to be considered recent, the services must have been provided within the last three (3) years from the date of solicitation release. Relevant: The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the Offeror's past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors' or teaming partners' involvement) based on data 80

provided or obtained. The Government may not necessarily agree with the Offeror's opinion of relevancy. Each previous/current contract provided in the proposal will receive one of the relevancy ratings listed below in Table 2-2: Table 2-2 - PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY ASSESSMENT RATING VERY RELEVANT RELEVANT DESCRIPTION Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same scope, qualifications, number of personnel, range of labor categories and complexity the solicitation requires Past/present performance effort involved much of the scope, qualifications, number of personnel, range of labor categories and complexity the solicitation requires Past/present performance effort involved some of the scope, qualifications, number of personnel, range of labor categories and complexity the solicitation requires Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the scope, qualifications, number of personnel, range of labor categories and complexity the solicitation requires

SOMEWHAT RELEVANT NOT RELEVANT

Current performance will have greater impact in the performance confidence assessment than less recent performance. More relevant performance will have greater impact in the Performance Confidence Assessment than less relevant effort. In determining relevancy, consideration will be given, but not limited to, such things as project similarity, project complexity, contract type, contract environment, and subcontractor interaction. Past performance that is technically relevant to the requirements of the SOW will be given greater consideration than non-relevant past performance. A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating. Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance. If an Offeror has no single project that encompasses all types of the required experience, the Offeror may: (i) Show relevant experience through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the SOW; (ii) Show relevant experience through personnel who are proposed to work on the contract that have had the required experience with another company. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor. For Offerors with no relevant performance record, the Government may consider relevant performance information regarding key personnel. Adverse past performance is considered any rating below Satisfactory on any questionnaire, survey or Government evaluation referenced in paragraph 2.1.3.2. Offerors with adverse past performance will be afforded an opportunity to address alleged deficiencies, if the Offeror has not already been provided an opportunity to comment on the deficiencies in accordance with FAR 15.306(a)(2) and FAR 15.306(b)(4). Where relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any implemented corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.

81

Quality of Performance: Assesses how well the Offeror performed. This will be assessed based on the ratings received in the Past Performance Questionnaires.

FACTOR III - PRICE: The Government will evaluate price for this procurement will be pursuant to a best value concept. The objective is to select the proposal that offers the best value for the Government, not necessarily the lowest price. However, as the performance confidence assessments of the Offerors become more equal in past performance ratings; cost may become a determining factor in award selection. Although the Price is least in importance, it will contribute to the source selection decision. While price will not be rated, as are Volumes 1 and 2, it will be evaluated in terms of completeness, balanced pricing and reasonableness. After an evaluation of Volume 1 and 2 has been completed and rankings have been established, the price to the Government will be compared against these rankings to determine the combination most advantageous to the Government. The Offeror's submission for Volume 3, Price, will be evaluated as follows: The Government will review the Pricing submissions for completeness and accuracy. Price reasonableness will be conducted for all Offerors. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price. Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation.

Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance, which when combined, the Non-Price Factors are significantly more important than Factor III "Price". However, as offerors ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor III "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision. Duration of Business Arrangement: The period of performance of this contract will be five years. There will be a twelve (12) month base period with four (4) 12-month option periods. This contract is not considered to be for advisory or assistance services in accordance with FAR Part 37.2. (b) Options.

95

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does

106

not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials

107

are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

108

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
