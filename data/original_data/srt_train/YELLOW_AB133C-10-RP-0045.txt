B.1

1352.216-70

CONTRACT TYPE (MAR 2000)

This is a firm-fixed price type contract for services. It consists of a base period from May 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 and four (4) one-year options. (End of clause) B.2 SCHEDULE OF ITEMS

Contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, materials, supplies, and equipment unless stated otherwise in the solicitation, to accomplish on-site network infrastructure maintenance, automated resource protection administration, and help-desk support services in accordance with the Statement of Work (Section C) and all other terms and conditions of the contract. B.3 CALCULATING COSTS

When calculating total cost, offeror shall include all known costs related to the performance of the Basic and Option Year periods. These costs shall include accrued vacation, fringe benefits, overtime and salaries; reference Section J, Attachment J.1.1 for the applicable wage determination. FAR 52.222-43 May 1989, Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act ­ Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts), only allows for adjustment in the contract price resultant from REVISIONS to the attached Wage Determination. Hence, any increase in an individual employee's benefits due to length of service should be given consideration in the price bid for the year in which the benefit is to be paid, as these increases are not considered to fall within the scope of the adjustment provisions. B.4 EXEMPTIONS FROM THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT COVERAGE

The Department of Labor Wage Determination attached to this solicitation establishes the minimum wages/fringe benefits to be paid to all covered service employees. The term "service employee", as defined in Section 8 (b) of the Service Contract Act, does not include persons employed in a bona fide executive, administrative or professional capacity as those terms are defined in 29 CFR Part 541. The bona fide executive set forth in the specified section of 29 CFR 541 lists 6 criteria, which are summarized below. To qualify for this exemption, an individual must: (1) Compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week (or $380 per week, if employed in American Samoa by employers other than the Federal Government), exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities; (2) Whose primary duty is management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof; (3) Who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees; and (4) Who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.

AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 5

SECTION B

Please note that ALL of these conditions must be met before exemption to Service Contract Act coverage can be claimed and utilized. Hence, any person, other than one clearly meeting all of the above requirements, who performs work called for under the contract, is considered to be a service employee and is subject to all terms and conditions of the Act and the applicable wage determination.

"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the CCR database" means that-(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five (5) years and six (6) months.

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts-(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. (c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/. (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it /_/ is, /_/ is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 541519 assigned to contract number ______________.

(a) "Definitions." As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) "Amendments to solicitations." If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) "Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals." (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (2) The first page of the proposal must show-(i) The solicitation number; (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available); (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal. Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of that agent's authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office. (3) "Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals." (i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 44

SECTION L INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS (1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation. (6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award. (7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. (8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (d) "Offer expiration date." Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) "Restriction on disclosure and use of data." Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection with-the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 45

SECTION L INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) "Contract award." (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

Due to heightened security, visitors to NOAA's Western Regional Center (WRC) will be required to produce picture ID, receive a visitor's pass, and be met by a NOAA employee at the building entry. When hand-delivering proposals, please allow adequate time for the security process. The guard on duty may call Crystina Elkins at extension 6036 or Leigh Baer at 4499 for notification purposes and pick-up of a proposal package at the security desk within Building 1's Lobby. The guard on duty in not authorized to take possession of any proposal package nor responsible to provide any kind of receipt or acknowledgement of a submission. Delivery is required to be made to Acquisition personnel, upon which it will be date-stamped in the Acquisition office, and will constitute the delivery time and receipt of the package. No paper receipt of the proposal package will be provided by the Acquisition office, so the allocation of sufficient time in proposal delivery is critical to ensure timely receipt. L.8 FACSIMILE PROPOSALS

Electronic proposals are not authorized. However, should the Government need to conduct "limited communications with offerors" or open discussions/negotiations, electronic e.g., facsimile and/or email, transmissions may be submitted as responses to communications, discussion/negotiations. Facsimile responses must contain all the information requested to be determined to be a complete response. If an electronic response is requested to be provided by the offeror, the Government will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or receipt of the electronic information, including the missing of any deadlines that may be established by the process. It is the Offerors responsibility to confirm receipt of any transmitted information. L.9 SET-ASIDE INFORMATION

a. This is a best value, competitive requirement. Award will be made to the offeror(s): whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements; who is determined responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the contract; and whose proposal is judged, by an integrated assessment of price and other evaluation factor(s) listed in SECTION M, to be the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will use the best value trade-off process in determining which offer is in the best interest of the Government, in accordance with FAR 15.101-1. b. The Government intends to award one (1) contract(s) from this solicitation. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted and the availability of funds. (1) Evaluation of Proposals A. Initial Evaluation of Proposals An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth in the Evaluation Criteria stated below, and all offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the established evaluation plan. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussion based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, Offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed. The Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement. B. Discussion/Final Proposal Revisions The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of the discussions, a final common cut-off date which allows a reasonable opportunity for submission of written final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors selected to remain in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions. C. Final Evaluation of Offers A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions. (End of clause) M.2 1352.215-76 EVALUATION CRITERIA (MAR 2000)

The cumulative weight of the technical evaluation factors will be considered more important than price in the evaluation process. Evaluation of technical proposals will be based on the factors listed below. Factors A, B, and C are in descending order of importance. FACTOR A: Technical Approach and Understanding of Requirements Offerors shall clearly and concisely demonstrate their understanding and knowledge of the tasks required to perform the work described in Section C, and their ability to perform the work in an efficient manner. Offerors shall submit their technical approach/staffing plan which shows the appropriate personnel quality, number, time commitment, skill level, and skill-mix to perform the work successfully. Offerors shall also demonstrate its concept/approach for maintaining and updating skill levels of proposed personnel. AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 53

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

FACTOR B: Technical Experience/Expertise/Qualifications Offerors will be evaluated on the experience, expertise, and qualifications of the personnel proposed in the staffing plan submitted above by providing resume(s) for each of its key and non-key personnel proposed to be assigned to this work. Resume(s) shall be evaluated to ensure that they demonstrate their ability to perform the work required under this contract, i.e., information on education, training, background, recent work experience as relating to this solicitation. FACTOR C: Past Performance

The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality of the past performance of the Contractor on similar contracts as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. Information utilized will be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, other customers known to the Government, and others who may have useful and relevant information. Information may also be considered regarding key personnel. Past performance provided will be assigned a risk rating as outlined below: Unsatisfactory/Very High Performance Risk Based on the offeror's poor performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the requirement effort. Marginal/High Performance Risk Based on the offeror's marginal performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory/Moderate Performance Risk Based on the offeror's satisfactory but not otherwise exemplary performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Very Good/Low Performance Risk Based on the offeror's very good performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Exceptional/Very Low Performance Risk Based on the offeror's exceptional performance record, no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Unknown Performance Risk The offeror has no experience relevant to the present requirements, or, after all reasonable efforts, the contracting officer was unable to obtain past performance information for relevant prior contracts. In this situation, an offeror shall not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably for past performance. Note: If an offeror's experience is a separate factor or subfactor, then the evaluation for that factor/subfactor shall take into account the offeror's lack of relevant experience. **If an offeror does not have any past performance history relevant to this effort, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor, i.e. a neutral rating will be assigned.

AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 54

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.3 EVALUATION RATINGS

Technical Proposals will be evaluated and rated using the descriptive scale as outlined below: 1. Outstanding. The proposal fully exceeds all minimum performance; capability or qualifications standards required by the RFP and exceed many of the requirements. Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards. The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated. The offer denotes the firm has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the RFP requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under the contract. VERY HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS. 2. Above Average. The proposal meets all of the minimum requirements; capability or qualifications standards required by the RFP and exceed some of the requirements. The offer denotes the firm has one or more strengths that will benefit the Government. Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed some performance or capability standards. The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality. The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government. Response exceeds a "Satisfactory" rating. HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS. 3. Satisfactory (Neutral). The proposal meets all of the minimum requirements, capability or qualifications standards required by the RFP with few or no advantages or strengths. Equates to Neutral. Acceptable solution. rating of "Satisfactory" indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, the offeror may satisfactorily complete the proposed tasks. Good probability of success as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved. Response exceeds a "Marginal" rating. No significant advantages or disadvantages.

A

4. Marginal. The proposal meets most of the minimum requirements, capability or qualifications standards required by the RFP. The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific factor(s) (or subfactor(s). The offeror's interpretation of the Government's requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect. The assignment of a rating within the bounds of "Marginal" indicates that the evaluator feels that mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project. Low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable. Response exceeds an "unsatisfactory" rating. Significant disadvantages. 5. Unsatisfactory. Fails to meet minimum requirements or capability standards. Requirements can only be met with major changes to the proposal. There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved. Offeror's response has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; failure to meet many of the minimum requirements. The offeror's proposal is so unacceptable that it would have to be completely revised in order to attempt to make it other than unacceptable. VERY SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGES.

AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 55

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.4 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JUL 1990)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (End of Provision) M.5 PRICE EVALUATION

Price proposals will be evaluated separately. Proposals will be evaluated based on the total (aggregate) price of all items listed in the Schedule in Section B. It is expected that competition will establish price reasonableness and that comparison of the proposed prices will satisfy the requirement to perform a price analysis. However, the Government reserves the right to examine proposed prices for completeness and reasonableness to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. Although price is considered to be less important than the cumulative weight of non-price factors, it will not be ignored. The degree of importance of the proposed price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based. M.6 BASIS FOR AWARD

Award will be made to the offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements; who is determined responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the contract; and whose proposal is judged to be most advantageous to the Government, considering all evaluation factors other than price. The Government will use the best value trade-off process in determining which offer is in the best interest of the Government, in accordance with FAR 15.101-1. Therefore, award may not be made to the offeror providing the highest technical capabilities or to the lowest priced offer, if determined that to do so would result in the best value to the Government for it is the overall value of these combined efforts which determine the best offer. The degree of importance of the proposed price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the factors listed above. In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors--Competitive Acquisition, the Government retains the right to award a contract on the basis of the original submissions. Offerors are urged to review their proposal packages for compliance of the solicitation's submission requirements prior to submitting their best offer with their original proposal.

SECTION J.2 ATTACHMENT #2 PART 2: EVALUATION (INFORMATION TO BE COMPLETED BY THE EVAULATOR RESPONDING FOR THE OFFEROR):
For each performance element identified below, references should evaluate performance of the firm or individual identified in Part 1 of this form. Where the reference lacks sufficient information to provide an evaluation for a particular performance element, this should be noted. Where any deficiency or unfavorable information is identified, the reference should identify any mitigating factors that may weigh in favor for the person/firm on whose behalf the reference is provided (i.e., problems due to causes outside the contractor's control). An individual within your organization that is knowledgeable of the contractor's day-to-day operations and overall performance should complete this questionnaire. However, that individual is encouraged to supplement their own knowledge of the contractor's (offeror's) performance with the judgment of others within their organization, as applicable. The following chart depicts the ratings that are to be used to evaluate the contractor's performance: Unsatisfactory/Very High Performance Risk Based on the offeror's poor performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the requirement effort. Marginal/High Performance Risk Based on the offeror's marginal performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory/Moderate Performance Risk Based on the offeror's satisfactory but not otherwise exemplary performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Very Good/Low Performance Risk Based on the offeror's very good performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Exceptional/Very Low Performance Risk Based on the offeror's exceptional performance record, no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Unknown Performance Risk The offeror has no experience relevant to the present requirements, or, after all reasonable efforts, the contracting officer was unable to obtain past performance information for relevant prior contracts. In this situation, an offeror shall not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably for past performance. Note: If an offeror's experience is a separate factor or subfactor, then the evaluation for that factor/subfactor shall take into account the offeror's lack of relevant experience.

UV = Unsatisfactory/Very High Performance Risk M = Marginal/High Performance Risk S = Satisfactory/Moderate Performance Risk V = Very Good/Low Performance Risk E = Exceptional/Very Low Performance Risk UP = Unknown Performance Risk
NOTE: UNKNOWN RISK WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT TO THE EVALUATOR PROVIDING A "NOT APPLICABLE (N/A)" TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS.

SECTION J.4 ATTACHMENT #4 QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT The COTR will assess the Contractor's performance over the preceding contract period using the rating elements listed in the "Performance Requirement" column of Attachment J.4, and the Performance Standards associated with the rating elements. The Contractor's performance in each rating area will be evaluated adjectivally as Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory, or Outstanding, using the following definitions of Contractor performance: Outstanding: Level of performance that exceeds the minimum Performance Standard by a substantial margin; Deficiencies are nonexistent or extremely minor. Satisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate meets the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are minor and offset by outstanding elements of performance within the Standard. Unsatisfactory: Level of performance that in the aggregate fails to meet the Performance Standard; Deficiencies are pervasive.

The COTR will meet and assess the Contractor's performance collectively. The Contractor's performance in each rating area will be determined. The Contracting Officer and the COTR will contact the Contractor to discuss an "Unsatisfactory" rating in any of the performance rating areas prior to making a final determination on that element of contract performance. The Contractor may respond in writing to each "Unsatisfactory" rating within 5 working days after the discussion, and the COTR will consider such responses before making a final rating determination. Performance at the "satisfactory" level is expected from the Contractor and may not be documented in detail. Costs associated with the work products that are returned for revision due to failure to meet the pre-stated standards shall be considered "replaced or corrected services." As such, costs for these services shall only be payable subject to the condition set forth in the inspection clause of this contract.

SECTION J.5 ATTACHMENT #5 QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT SERVICES INTRODUCTION This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to evaluate contractor actions while implementing this SOW. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring contractor performance for each listed objective on the Service Delivery Summary (SDS) in the maintenance contract. The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the services the contractor is required to furnish. This QASP is based on the premise the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in infrastructure support services and that a service contract to provide the service is the best means of achieving that objective. The contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved. In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. The contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of inspections and monitoring actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the contractor to success. Once the quality control program is approved, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust quality assurance program. Performance Objective Overall customer satisfaction Customer requests submitted to the Help Desk are handled in a professional manner and resolved to the satisfaction of the customer the vast majority of the time. Participation in meetings and planning activities Attendance and active participation in group, division, or other meetings Support calls and/or requests answered within acceptable timeframes All requests responded to within 30 minutes during business hours After hours calls answered within acceptable timeframes All requests responded to within one hour Effective tracking of all requests and management of updates to tracking system Maintain tracking system of all incoming requests, submit weekly AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 74 SOW Para 2.10.A.1 Performance Threshold 90% or higher customer satisfaction rating as determined by survey instruments and/or customer interviews 100% attendance by at least one representative from the contractor company at all invited meetings and/or planning activities 95% or higher timely responses

SURVEILLANCE: The government quality assurance (QA) person will receive complaints from base personnel and pass them to the contractor's quality control inspector (QCI) for correction. STANDARD: 95% of all facilities are without customer complaints for the month or service period. For example, if they are 100 facilities receiving service during the month, the QA should receive no more than 5 customer complaints during the service period. For the purpose of these services, a facility may never have more than three customer complaints. The QA shall notify the contracting officer for appropriate action in accordance with 52.246-4 INSPECTION OF SERVICES--FIXED-PRICE, if any of the above service areas exceed five customer complaints. PROCEDURES: Any base employee that observes unacceptable services, either incomplete or not performed, for any of the above performance objectives should immediately contact the QA and the QA will complete appropriate documentation to record the complaint. The QA will consider the customer complaint valid upon receipt from the customer. The QA should inform the customer of the approximate time the unacceptable performance will be corrected and advise the customer to contact the QA if not corrected. The QA will consider customer complaints as resolved unless notified otherwise by the customer. The QA shall verbally notify the Contractor's Quality Control Inspector (QCI) to pick up the written customer complaint. The QCI will be given two hours after verbal notification to correct the unacceptable performance. If the QCI disagrees with the complaint after investigation of the site and challenges the validity of the complaint, the QCI will notify the QA. The QA will conduct an investigation to determine the validity of the complaint. If the QA determines the complaint as invalid, he will document the written complaint of the findings and notify the customer. The QA will retain the annotated copy of the written complaint for his/her files. If after investigation the QA determines the complaint as valid, the QA will inform the QCI and the QCI will be given an additional hour to correct the defect. A defect will not be recorded if proper and timely correction of the unacceptable condition(s) is accomplished. The QCI shall return the written customer complaint document, properly completed with actions AB133C-10-RP-0045 Page - 75

Recurring customer complaints are not permitted for any of the above service items. If a repeat customer complaint is received indicating the same deficiency during the service period (month, quarter, etc.), the QA should contact the Contracting Officer for appropriate action.
