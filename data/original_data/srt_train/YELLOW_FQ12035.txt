SOLICITATION INSTRUCTIONS

1.

DEFINITIONS As used herein: "Clarifications" are limited exchanges, between the Authority and offerors, where offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals or to resolve minor irregularities, informalities or clerical errors. "Descriptive literature" means information provided by an offeror, such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, and brochures that shows a product's characteristics or construction of a product or explains its operation. The term includes only that information needed to evaluate the acceptability of the product and excludes other information for operating or maintaining the product. "Discussions" are negotiations that may occur after receipt of proposals (generally after establishment of the competitive range) and before award that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion; result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "Excluded Parties List System" means an electronic database maintained and posted by the General Services Administration containing the list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office. "In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "May" denotes the permissive. However, the words "no person may " mean that no person is required, authorized, or permitted to do the act described. "Must" (see "shall"). "Offer" means a response to a solicitation that, if accepted, would bind the offeror to perform the resultant contract. Responses to invitations for bids (sealed bidding) are offers called "bids" or "sealed bids"; responses to requests for proposals (negotiation) are offers called "proposals"; however, responses to requests for quotations (simplified acquisition) are "quotations," not offers. "Offeror" and "proposer" are synonymous and refer to the entity that submits an offer in response to this solicitation. "Option" means a unilateral right in a contract by which, for a specified time, the Authority may elect to purchase additional supplies or services called for by the contract, or may elect to extend the term of the contract. "Organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Authority, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. "Preaward survey" means an evaluation of a prospective contractor's capability to perform a proposed contract.

15   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

"Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer typically as a result of discussions. "Shall" means the imperative. "Should" means an expected course of action or policy that is to be followed unless inappropriate for a particular circumstance. "Solicitation" means "Request for Proposal (RFP)" where the procurement is negotiated. "Will" (see "shall"). 2. PREPARATION OF OFFERS a. b. Offerors are expected to examine the Request for Proposals and all referenced documents carefully. Failure to do so will be at the risk of the Offeror. The Offeror shall furnish the information required by the solicitation. The Offeror shall sign the solicitation and print or type his/her/its name on the Schedule a offeror and each Continuation Sheet thereof on which an entry has been made. Erasures or other changes must be initialed by the person signing the offer. Offers signed by an agent are to be accompanied by evidence of authority, unless such evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office. Offers for supplies or services other than those specified will not be considered unless authorized by the solicitation. Offeror must state a definite time for delivery of supplies or for performance of services unless otherwise specified in the solicitation. Time, if stated as a number of days, will include Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

c. d. e. 3.

EXPLANATION TO OFFERORS Any explanation desired by an Offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of the solicitation documents must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for a reply to reach all Offerors before the submission of their offers. Oral explanations or instructions given before the award of the contract will not be binding. Any information given to an Offeror concerning a solicitation will be furnished promptly to all Offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to other Offerors. All Requests should be addressed as follows and submitted via e-mail, facsimile or mail: William J. Geroux 600 Fifth Street, NW Washington, DC 20001 (202) 962-2467 Fax: (202) 962-6120

PRIOR REPRESENTATIONS The Authority assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representations concerning this solicitation made by any of its officers or agents prior to the issuance of the solicitation, the specifications, or related documents. 5. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF AMENDMENTS Receipt of an amendment to a solicitation by a Offeror must be acknowledged (a) by signing and returning the amendment, (b) by identifying the amendment number and date on the Solicitation, Offer and Award Form, (c) and by expressly acknowledging the amendment on the designated form and including it as part of the proposal. Such amendment must be received prior to the hour and date specified in the solicitation. If this solicitation is amended, then all terms and conditions which are not modified remain unchanged. 6. PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE For the purpose of clarifying the terms, conditions, and requirements of this Request for Proposal, a pre-proposal conference will be held to respond to questions by interested offerors. This preproposal conference will be held at 10:00 a.m. on 16 September 2011, in the Lobby Level Meeting Room of the WMATA Jackson Graham Building, 600 5th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001. The purpose of this conference will be to answer questions regarding, or requests for clarifications of, the solicitation documents. It is requested that offerors submit their questions in writing whether in advance of the meeting or during the meeting. Questions from the floor, however, are permissible. All questions concerning the terms, conditions, and requirements of this Request for Proposal must be received by the Contracting Officer in writing no later than ten (10) calendar days before the date for receipt of proposals. 7. REVISIONS PRIOR TO DATE SET FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS a. The right is reserved by the Authority to revise or amend the Scope of Work, Description of Work, drawings, etc. prior to the date set for the opening of proposals. Such revisions and amendments, if any, will be announced by an amendment to the Request for Proposal. Copies of such amendments as may be issued will be furnished to all prospective bidders. If the revisions and amendments require material changes in quantities or price proposals, or both, the date set for the opening of proposals may be postponed by such number of days as in the opinion of the Authority that will enable offerors to revise their proposals. In such cases, the amendment will include an announcement of the new date for the opening of proposals.

b.

8.

SUBMISSION OF OFFERS a. Offers and modifications thereof shall be enclosed in sealed envelopes and addressed to the office specified in the solicitation. The Offeror shall show the hour and date specified in the solicitation for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the Offeror on the face of the envelope.

17   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

b.

Telegraphic offers will not be considered unless authorized by the solicitation; however, offers may be modified or withdrawn by written or telegraphic notice, provided such notice is received prior to the hour and date specified for receipt. Facsimile offers, modifications or withdrawals will not be considered unless authorized by the Authority.

c.

9.

LATE SUBMISSIONS, MODIFICATIONS, AND WITHDRAWALS OF OFFERS a. Any offer received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it (1) Was sent by registered or certified U.S. mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been sent by registered mail by the 15th; Was sent by mail or, if authorized by the solicitation, was sent by telegram or via facsimile and it is determined by the Authority that the late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the Authority after receipt; Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of offers. The term "working days" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays; or Is the only offer received.

(2)

(3)

(4) b.

Any modification of an offer, except a modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request for "revised final proposals" offer, is subject to the same conditions as in subparagraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this provision. A modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request for "revised final proposals" received after the time and date specified in the request will not be considered unless received before award and the late receipt is due solely to mishandling by the Authority. The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late offer, modification, or withdrawal sent by registered or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the offer, modification or withdrawal shall be processed as if mailed late. "Postmark" means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been affixed by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, Offerors should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper. The only acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt by the Authority is the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper or other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the Authority. The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late offer, modification, or withdrawal sent by Express Mail Next Day Service Post Office to Addressee is the date

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

entered by the post office receiving clerk on the "Express Mail Next Day Service Post Office to Addressee" label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service. "Postmark" has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (d) of this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. Therefore, Offeror or Quoter should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bulls-eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper. g. Notwithstanding paragraph "a" above, a late modification of any otherwise successful offer that makes its terms more favorable to the Authority will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision entitled "Facsimile Proposals". Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an Offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative's identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

MINIMUM PROPOSAL ACCEPTANCE PERIOD a. "Acceptance period," as used in this provision, means the number of calendar days available to WMATA for awarding a contract from the date specified in this solicitation for receipt of proposals. This provision supersedes any language pertaining to the acceptance period that may appear elsewhere in this solicitation. WMATA requires a minimum acceptance period of 120 calendar days from the latest revised proposal.

b. c.

13.

CONTRACT AWARD a. The Authority will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Authority cost or price and other factors, specified elsewhere in this solicitation, considered. The Authority may (1) reject the offer if such action is in the public interest, or (2) waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. The Authority may award a contract on the basis of the initial offer received, without discussions (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarifications). Therefore, the initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Authority reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.

b. c.

19   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

d.

A written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Authority may accept an offer (or part of an offer, as provided in paragraph (d) above) whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Negotiations conducted after receipt of an offer do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Authority. Neither financial data submitted with an offer, nor representations concerning facilities or financing will form a part of the resulting contract. However, if the resulting contract contains a clause providing for price reduction for defective cost or pricing data, the contract price will be subject to reduction if cost or pricing data furnished is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current. The Authority may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub-line items. An offer is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated in relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt that the offer will result in the lowest overall cost to the Authority even though it may be the low evaluated offer, or it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.

DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES REQUIREMENTS Attached as part of this solicitation are documents outlining the requirements for the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program: The DBE requirement goal for this contract is 0.00% unless a good faith waiver is requested and approved. a.

The provisions of Appendix B (if attached) do not become applicable and forms do not have to be completed, unless the total offer is $100,000 or more. If the offer is $100,000 or more and any portion of the written requirement is omitted, then the offer may be found to be unacceptable and subsequently rejected. Appendix B forms and/or waivers must be completed with great care by each Offeror to insure that the offer is acceptable.

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority hereby notifies all Offerors that it will affirmatively ensure that disadvantaged minority business enterprises will be afforded full opportunity to submit offers in response to this solicitation and will not be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, or national origin in consideration for award. 16. NOTICE OF PROTEST POLICY a. WMATA policy and procedure for the administrative resolution of protests is set forth in Chapter 20 of the Authority's Procurement Procedures Manual (PPM). Chapter 20 contains strict rules for filing a timely protest, for responding to a notice that a protest has been filed, and other procedural matters. The Contracting Officer can furnish a copy of Chapter 20 upon request. FTA Circular 4220.1F, addresses Bid Protests. FTA will only review protests regarding the alleged failure of the grantee to have a written protest procedure or alleged failure to follow such procedures, and only when submitted by an interested party. The term "interested party" is defined in the Authority policy for handling protests. Alleged violation on other grounds must be submitted to the Contracting Officer who will decide the protest. The judicial authorities having jurisdiction over court actions concerning protest decisions are the United States District Courts for the Districts of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, and the local courts in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The Authority may designate additional individuals, usually in the supervisory chain as the Authority Representative, who have dollar authority in excess of the Authority Representative's stated authority (see also definition of Contracting Officer).

Unless the Contractor is directed to the contrary, all correspondence with respect to this Contract shall be sent to the Authority Representative. "Contracting Officer" means an employee within the Authority's Office of Procurement and Materials with authority duly delegated from the powers of the General Manager to legally bind the Authority by signing a contractual instrument. Contracting Officers have the authority to make related determinations and findings, and take other significant actions including, but not limited to: awards, changes, modifications, final payments, suspensions, terminations, debarments, assessment of liquidated damages, and issuances of final decisions. The term includes certain other representatives of the Authority acting within delegated limits of authority. In general, the Authority's primary point of contact for pre-award administration and fiscal closeout resides with the Contracting Officer, and the primary point of contact for the post-award contract administration may be either the Authority Representative or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.

In addition to the records required to be originated under b. above, in the event pricing of an adjustment under this Contract is not agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer prior to the commencement of work for which the pricing adjustment is requested, the Contractor and any subcontractor engaged in work for which the pricing adjustment is requested, shall maintain accounts and original cost records specifically segregated and identified by job order or other appropriate accounting procedures approved by the Contracting Officer of all incurred segregable costs related to the work for which the pricing adjustment is requested.

In the event the Contractor or any subcontractor fails to originate or to maintain, or to make available any accounts or records as required under this or any other Article of the Contract, any pricing adjustment or portion thereof previously granted by the Contracting Officer for which records are not available shall be rescinded and recomputed, or if a pricing adjustment has not yet been granted shall be computed, in an amount not to exceed the direct costs for the affected work for which accounts or records are not available, plus a single markup for indirect expenses not to exceed ten percent of the direct costs so determined by the Contracting Officer. The adjustment will be established by the Contracting Officer based upon, at his or her election, either, (1) (2) (3) an audit of any existing books and records of the Contractor or subcontractor; or an Authority estimate adopted by the Contracting Officer, or a combination of (1) and (2); plus a single mark-up for indirect expenses not to exceed ten percent of the direct costs so determined by the Contracting Officer.

identification of the contracting parties and the Contracting Officer under this Contract. 3. ASSIGNMENT a. Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the Contractor shall not transfer any of its rights and obligations under this Contract to third parties without the prior consent of the Authority. The Authority may recognize a third party as successor in interest to the Contract in the event of a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Contractor, a Division of the Contractor involved in the performance of the Contract, or a Parent company providing a performance guarantee under this Contract, (i.e., sales of assets, transfer of assets pursuant to merger or consolation, or incorporation of a proprietorship or partnership). Such recognition of the transfer shall be within the discretion of the Contracting Officer after review of the facts and circumstances surrounding each request. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may conduct an evaluation of the successor party's capability to perform the Contract in the same manner and to the same extent the Contracting Officer was empowered to conduct a responsibility determination as part of the original solicitation for this Contract. Should the Contracting Officer, for any reason, not recognize such a successor in interest, it may terminate this Contract for the convenience of the Authority. Claims for monies due or to become due the Contractor from the Authority under this Contract may be assigned to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency, and may thereafter be further assigned and reassigned to any institution, upon written notice of such assignment to the Authority. Any such assignment or reassignment shall cover all amounts payable under this Contract and not already paid, and shall not be made to more than one party, except that any such assignment or reassignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating in such financing. It is the Authority's intent to recognize assignments only to bona fide lending institutions; therefore, assignment to any private corporation, business or individual which does not qualify as such is specifically prohibited. Any attempt to transfer by assignment not authorized by this provision shall constitute a breach of the Contract and the Authority may for such cause, terminate the Contract with the DEFAULT provision of these General Provisions, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Authority under the DEFAULT provision.

contractual relationship established under this Contract, unless an exception is granted as described below. b. Upon request of the Contractor and upon full disclosure and for good cause the Contracting Officer may in his sole discretion grant an exception to the requirement of a., above, when in his judgment the exception will not create a conflict between the Contractor's duties and obligations under this contract and the duties and obligations imposed on the Contractor under the contractual or other relationship for which an exception is requested.

CONTRACT WORK HOURS AND SAFETY STANDARDS ACT-OVERTIME COMPENSATION Pursuant to Section 102 (Overtime): (1) Overtime requirements - No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics shall require or permit any such laborer or mechanic in any workweek in which he or she is employed on such work to work in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer or mechanic receives compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of forty hours in such workweek. Violation; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages - In the event of any violation of the clause set forth in paragraph (1) of this section the

(2)

52   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefore shall be liable for the unpaid wages. In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic, including watchmen and guards, employed in violation of the clause set forth in paragraph (1) of this section, in the sum of $ 10 for each calendar day on which such individual was required or permitted to work in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by the clause set forth in paragraph (1) of this section. (3) Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages - The Authority shall upon its own action or upon written request of an authorized representative of the Department of Labor withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor under any such contract or any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, or any other federally-assisted contract subject to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, which is held by the same prime contractor, such sums as may be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages as provided in the clause set forth in paragraph (2) of this section. Subcontracts - The contractor or subcontractor shall insert in any subcontracts the clauses set forth in this section and also a clause requiring the subcontractors to include these clauses in any lower tier subcontracts. The prime contractor shall be responsible for compliance by any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor with the clauses set forth in this section.

(4)

Section 107 (OSHA): Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act - (i) The Contractor agrees to comply with section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 40 U.S.C. section 333, and applicable DOL regulations, " Safety and Health Regulations for Construction " 29 C.F.R. Part 1926. Among other things, the Contractor agrees that it will not require any laborer or mechanic to work in unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous surroundings or working conditions. (ii) Subcontracts - The Contractor also agrees to include the requirements of this section in each subcontract. The term "subcontract" under this section is considered to refer to a person who agrees to perform any part of the labor or material requirements of a contract for construction, alteration or repair. A person who undertakes to perform a portion of a contract involving the furnishing of supplies or materials will be considered a "subcontractor" under this section if the work in question involves the performance of construction work and is to be performed: (1) directly on or near the construction site, or (2) by the employer for the specific project on a customized basis. Thus, a supplier of materials which will become an integral part of the construction is a "subcontractor" if the supplier fabricates or assembles the goods or materials in question specifically for the construction project and the work involved may be said to be construction activity. If the goods or materials in question are ordinarily sold to other customers from regular inventory, the supplier is not a "subcontractor." The requirements of this section do not apply to contracts or

53   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

subcontracts for the purchase of supplies or materials or articles normally available on the open market. 10. CONVICT LABOR In connection with the performance of work under this Contract, the Contractor agrees not to employ any person undergoing sentence of imprisonment except as provided by Public Law 89-176, September 10, 1965. 11.

Definitions: As used in this article: (1) Deficiency means any condition or characteristics in any supplies (which term shall include related technical data) or services furnished hereunder, which is not in compliance with the requirements of this Contract. Correction means any and all actions necessary to eliminate any and all deficiencies. Supplies mean the end item(s) furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this Contract.

(2) (3) b.

General: (1) The rights and remedies of the Authority provided in this article: (a) Shall not be affected in any way by any other provisions under this Contract concerning the conclusiveness of inspection and acceptance; and Are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Authority by any other article of this Contract.

(b) (2) (3)

This article shall apply only to those deficiencies discovered by either the Authority or the Contractor within one year after acceptance. The Contractor shall not be responsible under this article for the correction of deficiencies in Authority furnished property, except for deficiencies in installation, unless the Contractor performs or is obligated to perform any modifications or other work on such property. In that event, the Contractor shall be responsible for correction of deficiencies to the extent of such modifications or other work. The Contractor shall not be responsible under this article for the correction of deficiencies caused by the Authority.

(4) c.

Deficiencies in accepted supplies or services: (1) Notice to Contractor - Recommendation for Correction: If the Contracting Officer determines that a deficiency exists in any of the supplies or services accepted by the Authority under this Contract, he shall promptly notify the Contractor of the deficiency, in writing, within 30 days.

notification of the existence of such a deficiency, or if the Contractor independently discovers a deficiency in accepted supplies or services, the Contractor shall promptly submit to the Contracting Officer his recommendation for corrective actions, together with supporting information in sufficient detail for the Contracting Officer to determine what corrective action, if any, shall be undertaken. (2) Direction to Contractor concerning correction of deficiencies: Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's recommendations for corrective action and adequate supporting information, the Contracting Officer, at his sole discretion, shall give the Contractor written notice not to correct any deficiency, or to correct or partially correct any deficiency within a reasonable time and at a specified location.

Modification of Contract With respect to uncorrected deficiencies: In the event of timely notice of a decision not to correct or only to partially correct, the Contractor shall promptly submit a technical and cost proposal to amend the Contract to permit acceptance of the affected supplies or services in accordance with the revised requirements, and an equitable reduction in Contract price shall promptly be negotiated by the parties and reflected in a supplemental agreement to this Contract.

(3)

(4)

d.

Deficiencies in supplies or services not yet accepted: If the Contractor becomes aware at any time before acceptance by the Authority (whether before or after tender to the Authority) that a deficiency exists in any supplies or services, he shall promptly correct the deficiency or, if he elects to invoke the procedures in paragraph c. above, he shall promptly communicate information concerning the deficiency to the Contracting Officer, in writing, together with his detailed recommendation for corrective action. No extension in time for performance; no increase in Contract price. (1) In no event shall the Authority be responsible for extension or delays in the schedule deliveries or periods of performance under this Contract as a result of the Contractor's obligations to correct deficiencies, nor shall there be any adjustment of the delivery schedule or period of performance as a result of such correction of deficiencies, except as may be agreed to by the Authority in a supplemental agreement with adequate consideration. It is hereby specifically recognized and agreed by the parties hereto that this article shall not be construed as obligating the Authority to increase the Contract price of this Contract.

The Contractor shall also bear the responsibility for the supplies while in transit. When compliance with the terms of this article by the Contractor involves shipment of corrected or replacement supplies from the Contractor to the Authority, the Contractor shall be liable for transportation charges up to an amount equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment from the Contractor's plant to the designated destination point under this Contract, in addition to any charges provided for by (1) above. The Contractor shall also bear the responsibility for the supplies while in transit.

(2)

g.

Failure to correct: If the Contractor fails or refuses to (1) (2) (3) present a detailed recommendation for corrective action in accordance with c. above, correct deficiencies in accordance with c. (3) above, or prepare and furnish data and reports in accordance with paragraph c. (3) above, the Contracting Officer shall give the Contractor written notice specifying the failure or refusal and setting a period after receipt of the notice within which it must be cured.

(2)(a) Correct the supplies or services, or (b) Replace the supplies or services; and if the Contractor fails to furnish timely disposition instructions, the Contracting Officer may dispose of nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable manner, in which case the Authority is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor or from the proceeds for the reasonable expenses of care and disposition, as well as for excess costs incurred or to be incurred; and (3) h. Obtain applicable data and reports and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Authority thereby.

COST OR PRICING DATA a. The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer, either actually or by specific identification in writing, cost or pricing data under the conditions described in this paragraph and certify that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data submitted is accurate, complete, and current as of the date of execution, which date shall be as close as possible to the date of agreement on the negotiated price of the Contract modification. The cost or pricing data shall be submitted at the time the Contractor submits his proposal for the pricing of any modification to this Contract, whether or not cost or pricing data was required in connection with the initial pricing of the Contract, when the modification involves aggregate increases and/or decreases in costs plus applicable profits expected to exceed $100,000, or less at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The submittal of certified cost or pricing data shall not be required if the price is based on adequate price competition, established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public, or prices set by law or regulation. The Contractor agrees that the terms adequate price competition and established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public shall be determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the guidelines as set forth in Subpart 15.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR 15.4). Cost or pricing data consists of all facts existing up to the time of agreement on price which prudent buyers and sellers would reasonably expect to have a significant effect on the price negotiations for the modification. The definition of cost or pricing data embraces more than historical accounting data; it also includes where applicable, such factors as subcontractor, supplier and vendor quotations, nonrecurring costs, changes in construction methods, unit cost trends such as those associated with labor efficiency and any management decisions which could reasonably be expected to have a significant bearing on costs under the proposed modification and the Contract work. Cost or pricing data consists of all facts which can reasonably be expected to contribute to sound estimates of future costs as well as to the validity of costs already incurred. Cost or pricing data, being factual, is that type of information which can be verified. Because the certificate pertains to cost or pricing data, it does not make representations as to the accuracy of the Contractor's judgment on the estimated portion of future costs or projections. The certificate does, however, apply to the data upon which the Contractor's judgment is based.

COVENANT AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES The Contractor warrants that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure this Contract upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, excepting bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the Contractor for the purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty, the Authority shall have the right to annul this Contract without liability or in its discretion, to deduct from the Contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover, the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.

14.

DEFAULT

57   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

a.

The Authority may, subject to the provisions of paragraph c. below, by written notice of default to the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of this Contract in any one of the following circumstances: (1) If the Contractor fails to make delivery of the supplies or to perform the services within the time specified herein or any extension thereof; or (2) If the Contractor fails to perform any of the other provisions of this Contract, or so fails to make progress as to endanger performance of this Contract in accordance with its terms, and in either of these two circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure.

b.

In the event the Authority terminates this Contract in whole or in part as provided in paragraph a. of this article, the Authority may procure, upon such terms and in such manner as the Contracting Officer may deem appropriate, supplies or services similar to those so terminated, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Authority for any excess costs for such similar supplies or services; provided, that the Contractor shall continue the performance of this Contract to the extent not terminated under the provisions of this article. Except with respect to defaults of subcontractors, the Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the Contract arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Such causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in its sovereign capacity or the Authority in its contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather; but in every case the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a subcontractor, and if such default arises out of causes beyond the control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either of them, the Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs for failure to perform, unless the supplies or services to be furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time to permit the Contractor to meet the required delivery schedule. If this Contract is terminated as provided in paragraph a. of this article, the Authority, in addition to any other rights provided in this article, may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the Authority, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Contracting Officer, (1) (2) any completed supplies, and such partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tools, dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (hereinafter called "manufacturing materials") as the Contractor has specifically produced or specifically acquired for the performance of such part of this Contract as has been terminated; and the Contractor shall, upon direction of the Contracting Officer, protect and preserve property in the possession of the Contractor in which the Authority has an interest. Payment for completed supplies delivered to and accepted by the Authority shall be at the Contract price. Payment for manufacturing materials delivered to and accepted by the Authority and for the protection and preservation of property shall be in an

c.

d.

58   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

amount agreed upon by the Contractor and Contracting Officer; failure to agree to such amount shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the DISPUTES article of this Contract. The Authority may withhold from amounts otherwise due the Contractor for such completed supplies or manufacturing materials such sum as the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the Authority against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders. e. If, after notice of termination of this Contract under the provisions of article, it is determined for any reason that the Contractor was not in default under the provisions of this article, or that the default was excusable under the provisions of this article, the rights and obligations of the parties shall, if the Contract contains an article providing for termination for convenience of the Authority, be the same as if the notice of termination had been issued pursuant to such article. If, after notice of termination of this Contract under the provisions of this article, it is determined for any reason that the Contractor was not in default under the provisions of this article, and if this Contract does not contain an article providing for termination for convenience of the Authority, the Contract shall be equitably adjusted to compensate for such termination and the Contract modified accordingly; failure to agree to such adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the DISPUTES article of this Contract. If the Contractor fails to deliver the supplies or perform the services within the time specified in this Contract, or any extension thereof, the actual damage to the Authority for the delay will be difficult or impossible to determine. Therefore in lieu of actual damages, the Contractor shall pay to the Authority as fixed, agreed and liquidated damages for each calendar day of delay, the amount set forth elsewhere in this Contract. Alternatively, the Authority may terminate this Contract in whole or in part as provided in paragraph a. of this article, and in that event the Contractor shall be liable, in addition to the excess costs provided in paragraph b. above, for such liquidated damages accruing until such time as the Authority may reasonably obtain delivery or performance of similar supplies or services. The Contractor shall not be charged with liquidated damages when the delay arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, as defined in paragraph c. above, and in such event, subject to the DISPUTES article, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and extent of the delay and shall extend the time for performance of the contract when in his judgment the findings of fact justify an extension. The rights and remedies of the Authority provided in this article shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this Contract. As used in paragraph c. of this clause, the terms subcontractor and subcontractors mean subcontractor(s) at any tier.

DELAY OF WORK a. If the performance of all or any part of the work is delayed or interrupted by an act of the Contracting Officer in the administration of this Contract, which act is not expressly or impliedly authorized by this Contract, or by his failure to act within the time specified, an adjustment (excluding profit) shall be made for any increase in the cost of performance of this Contract caused by such delay or interruption and the

59   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

contract modified in writing accordingly. Adjustment shall be made also in the delivery or performance dates and any other contractual provision affected by such delay or interruption. However, no adjustment shall be made under this article for any delay or interruption (1) (2) b. to the extent that performance would have been delayed or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor; or for which an adjustment is provided or excluded under any other provision of this Contract.

No claim under this clause shall be allowed (1) for any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the Contracting Officer in writing of the act or failure to act involved; and unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the termination of such delay or interruption, but not later than the date of final payment under the Contract.

16.

DISPUTES a. Except as otherwise provided in this Contract, any dispute concerning a question of fact arising under or related to this Contract which is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting Officer, who shall reduce his/her decision to writing and mail or otherwise furnish a copy thereof to the Contractor. The decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive unless, within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor mails or otherwise furnishes to the Contracting Officer a written notice of appeal addressed to the Authority Board of Directors. Such notice would indicate that an appeal is intended and should reference the decision and contract number. The decision of the Board of Directors or its duly authorized representative for the determination of such appeals shall be final and conclusive unless in proceedings initiated by either party for review of such decision in a court of competent jurisdiction, the court determines the decision to have been fraudulent, or capricious, or arbitrary, or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or is not supported by substantial evidence. In connection with any appeal proceeding under this article, the Contractor, or the Authority, as the case may be, shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and offer evidence in support of its appeal. Pending final decision of a dispute hereunder, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance of the Contract and in accordance with the Contracting Officer's decision. The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals is the authorized representative of the Board of Directors for finally deciding appeals to the same extent as could the Board of Directors. This DISPUTES article does not preclude consideration of question of law in connection with decisions provided for in Section a. above. Nothing in the Contract, however, shall be construed as making final the decisions of the Board of Directors or its representative on a question of law.

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

a.

The Contractor warrants that it will not offer employment to any officer or employee of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) who has been involved, directly or indirectly, in any matter of financial interest to the Contractor until at least one year after the officer or employee has ceased involvement in or responsibility for the matter. The Contractor further warrants that it will not employ any WMATA officer or employee who has had direct responsibility for any matter of financial interest to the Contractor within the year prior to the retirement or termination of the officer or employee until at least one full year after such officer or employee has left the employment of the Authority. The one year requirement described in a. and b. above may be waived at the discretion of the Contracting Officer if the WMATA employee or former employee has been subject to a Reduction in Force; in such case, the Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a letter to that effect. If a waiver is granted, or if a former employee of WMATA is eventually hired, the Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the former employee is not directly involved in negotiating or otherwise dealing with WMATA on any particular matter over which such employee had responsibility during his or her period of employment at WMATA. Should the Contractor fail to comply with paragraphs a., b. or d. above, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to withhold payment under this Contract in an amount not to exceed 2% of the total Contract amount as liquidated damages to the Authority, such withholding to be in addition to any other withholding under this Contract. Further, the Contracting Officer shall consider such violation in evaluating the Contractor's responsibility in connection with award of any other Authority Contract.

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES a. b. Except as may be otherwise provided in this Contract, the Contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and Local taxes and duties. Nevertheless, with respect to any Federal excise tax or duty on the transactions or property covered by this Contract, if a statue, court decision, written ruling, or regulation takes effect after the Contract date, and: (1) Results in the Contractor being required to pay or bear the burden of any such Federal excise tax or duty or increase in the rate thereof which would not otherwise have been payable on such transactions or property, the Contract price shall be increased by the amount of such tax or duty or rate increase, provided the Contractor warrants in writing that no amount for such

61   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

newly imposed Federal excise tax or duty or rate increase was included in the Contract price as a contingency reserve or otherwise; or (2) Results in the Contractor not being required to pay or bear the burden of, or in his obtaining a refund or drawback of, any such Federal excise tax or duty which would otherwise have been payable on such transactions or property or which was the basis of an increase in the Contract price, the Contract price shall be decreased by the amount of the relief, refund, or drawback, or that amount shall be paid to the Authority, as directed by the Contracting Officer. The Contract price shall be similarly decreased if the Contractor, through his fault or negligence or his failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer, is required to pay or bear the burden of, or does not obtain a refund or drawback of, any such Federal excise tax or duty.

c. d. e.

Paragraph b. above shall not be applicable to social security taxes or to any other employment tax. No adjustment of less than $100 shall be made in the Contract price pursuant to paragraph b. above. As used in paragraph b. above, the term Contract date means the date set for bid opening, or if this is a negotiated contract, the Contract date. As to additional supplies or services procured by modification to this Contract, the term Contract date means the date of such modification. Unless there does not exist any reasonable basis to sustain an exemption, the Authority upon the request of the Contractor shall, without further liability, furnish evidence appropriate to establish exemption from any Federal, State or Local tax; provided that evidence appropriate to establish exemption from any Federal excise tax or duty which may give rise to either an increase or decrease in the Contract price will be furnished only at the discretion of the Authority. The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of matters which will result in either an increase or decrease in the Contract price and shall take action with respect thereto as directed by the Contracting Officer.

b.

Reported instances of the giving or offering to give gratuities within the context of this GRATUITIES article will be investigated by the Board of Directors or its duly authorized representative. A preliminary investigation will be made to determine whether there is probable cause to suspect that a violation of this article has been committed. If such probable cause is found to exist, the Board of Directors, or its duly authorized representative, shall formally notify the suspected donor corporation or individual in writing of the particulars of the event; and provide such donor the opportunity to be heard on the matter. The aims of the investigations and hearing shall be to ensure due process and to preserve the best interests and rights of all parties by the full and fair disclosure of all relevant and material information. Accordingly, the Board of Directors, or its duly authorized representative, shall require production of all pertinent documents and records, and sworn testimony from witnesses. During the pendency of any investigation or hearing treating with a violation of this GRATUITIES article, the Board of Directors, or its duly authorized representative may exercise its power granted by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact, Public Law 774, 80 Star. 1324, Article V, General Powers, Subparagraph (k), by issuing subpoenas to compel the attendance of necessary witnesses, and to compel production of papers, records, accounts, ledgers and documents. The subpoenas shall be enforceable by order of an appropriate United States District Court. If, after notice and hearing, or notice of the opportunity to be heard, the Board of Directors, or its duly authorized representative, finds that a violation of this GRATUITIES article has been committed, the Authority shall have the right to: (1) (2) Require that the individual(s) giving or offering the gratuity be removed from further participation on any Authority projects (be terminated); Deny the Contractor any G & A (general and administrative) mark-ups for all changes and/or modifications found to be tainted by the giving of or offering to give gratuities; Preclude the Contractor from bidding on, receiving or participating as joint venturer, subcontractor or otherwise in any Authority project for a period of five years; Have complete access to all the Contractor's financial books, records and accounts for the purpose of performing a comprehensive audit of the entire project. In the event of repeated violations of this GRATUITIES article or of gross or extreme conduct indicative of a corrupt intent to gain special advantage, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under the Contract.

c.

The existence of the facts upon which the Board of Directors, or its duly authorized representative, makes findings in connection with investigations and hearings in consonance herewith shall be an issue and may be reviewed in any competent court. In the event this Contract is terminated as provided in paragraph b. (5) hereof, the Authority shall be entitled (1) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of the Contract by the Contractor, and

as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in any amount (as determined by the Board or its duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the costs incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.

e.

The rights and remedies of the Authority provided in this article shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this Contract.

21.

INSPECTION OF SERVICES a. b. "Services" as used in this clause, includes services performed, workmanship, and material furnished or utilized in the performance of services. The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Authority covering the services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Authority during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the Contract requires. The Authority has the right to inspect and test all services called for by this contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract. The Authority shall perform inspection and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. If the Authority performs inspections or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at non-increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. If any of the services performed do not conform to contract requirements, the Authority may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, for no additional fee. When the defects in performance cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Authority may: (1) (2) f. Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; or Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.

c.

d.

e.

If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Authority may: (1) By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the contractor any cost incurred by the Authority that is directly related to the performance of the service; or Terminate the contract for default.

INSPECTION OF SUPPLIES a. b. Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies. The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Authority covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Authority for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Authority during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Authority may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract. The Authority has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Authority shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Authority assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract. If the Authority performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Authority shall bear the expense of Authority inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Authority shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples. When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test. The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary. The Authority has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Authority may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions. The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.

h.

If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Authority may either (1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2) terminate the contract for default. Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute. If this contract provides for the performance of Authority quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Authority, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time when Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and when the supplies will be ready for Authority inspection. The Authority's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Authority representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than two (2) workdays of advance notification if the Authority representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than seven (7) workdays in other instances. The Authority shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Authority failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Authority, for nonconforming supplies. Inspections and tests by the Authority do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract. If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Authority, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of ten (10) calendar days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Authority shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Authority thereby.

66   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

performed, the total of the amounts so withheld at any one time shall not exceed the greatest amount which may be withheld under any one such article or schedule provision at that time; provided, that this limitation shall not apply to: a. b. c. 24. Withholdings pursuant to any clause relating to wages or hours of employees; Withholdings not specifically provided for by this Contract; and The recovery of overpayment.

NEW MATERIAL Except as to any supplies and components which the Specifications or schedule specifically provides need not be new, the Contractor represents that the supplies and components to be provided under this Contract are new (not used or reconditioned, and not of such age or so deteriorated as to impair their usefulness or safety). If at any time during the performance of this Contract, the Contractor believes that the furnishing of supplies or components which are not new is necessary or desirable, he shall notify the Contracting Officer immediately, in writing, including the reasons therefore and proposing any consideration which will flow to the Authority if authorization to use such supplies is granted.

25.

NOTICE AND ASSISTANCE REGARDING PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT The provisions of this article shall be applicable only if the amount of this Contract exceeds $10,000. a. The Contractor shall report to the Contracting Officer, promptly and in reasonable written detail, each notice or claim of patent or copyright infringement based on the performance of this Contract of which the Contractor has knowledge. In the event of any claim or suit against the Authority on account of any alleged patent or copyright infringement arising out of the performance of this Contract or out of the use of any supplies furnished or work or services performed hereunder, the Contractor shall furnish to the Authority, when requested by the Contracting Officer, all evidence and information in possession of the Contractor pertaining to such suit or claim. Such evidence and information shall be furnished at the expense of the Authority except where the Contractor has agreed to indemnify the Authority. This clause shall be included in all subcontracts.

c. 26.

NOTICE TO THE AUTHORITY OF LABOR DISPUTES a. Whenever the Contractor has knowledge that any actual or potential labor dispute is delaying or threatens to delay the timely performance of this Contract, the Contractor shall immediately give notice thereof, including all relevant information with respect thereto, to the Contracting Officer. The Contractor agrees to insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph b., in any subcontract hereunder as to which a labor dispute may delay the timely performance of this Contract; except that each such subcontract shall provide that in the event its timely performance is delayed or threatened by delay by any actual or potential labor dispute, the subcontractor shall immediately notify his next higher tier

b.

No member of or delegate to Congress, or resident commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Contract, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom; but this provision shall not be construed to extend to this Contract if made with a corporation for its general benefit. No member, officer, or employee of the Public Body or of a local public body during his tenure or one year thereafter shall have any interest, direct or indirect, in this Contract or the proceeds thereof.

In the event of a conflict within, between or among all the above listed order of precedent, the more stringent requirement shall apply.

29.

PATENT AND RIGHTS IN DATA a. Rights in Data - The following requirements apply to each contract involving experimental, developmental or research work: (1) The term "subject data" used in this section means recorded information, whether or not copyrighted, that is delivered or specified to be delivered under this contract. The term includes graphic or pictorial delineation in media such as drawings or photographs; text in specifications or related performance or design-type documents; machine forms such as punched cards, magnetic tape, or computer memory printouts; and information retained in computer memory. Examples include, but are not limited to: computer software, engineering drawings and associated lists; specifications, standards, process sheets, manuals, technical reports, catalog item identifications, and related information. The term "subject data" does not include financial reports, cost analyses, and similar information incidental to Project administration. The following restrictions apply to all subject data first produced in the performance of this contract. (a) Except for its own internal use, the Authority or Contractor may not publish or reproduce subject data in whole or in part, or in any manner or form, nor may the Authority or Contractor authorize others to do so, without the written consent of the Federal Government, until such time as the Federal Government may have either released or approved the release of such data to the public; this restriction on publication, however, does not apply to any contract with an academic institution

(2)

68   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

(b)

In accordance with 49 CFR § 18.34 and 49 CFR § 19.36, the Federal Government reserves a royalty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for "Federal Government purposes," any subject data or copyright described in subsections (2)(b)1 and (2)(b)2 of this clause below. As used in the previous sentence, "for Federal Government purposes," means use only for the direct purposes of the Federal Government. Without the copyright owner's consent, the Federal Government may not extend its Federal license to any other party. i. ii. Any subject data developed under that contract, whether or not a copyright has been obtained; and Any rights of copyright purchased by the Authority or Contractor using Federal assistance in whole or in part provided by FTA.

(c)

When FTA awards Federal assistance for experimental, developmental, or research work, it is FTA's general intention to increase transportation knowledge available to the public, rather than to restrict the benefits resulting from the work to participants in that work. Therefore, unless FTA determines otherwise, the Authority and the Contractor performing experimental, developmental, or research work required by the underlying contract to which this Attachment is added agrees to permit FTA to make available to the public, either FTA's license in the copyright to any subject data developed in the course of that contract, or a copy of the subject data first produced under the contract for which a copyright has not been obtained. If the experimental, developmental, or research work, which is the subject of the underlying contract, is not completed for any reason whatsoever, all data developed under that contract shall become subject data as defined in subsection (a) of this clause and shall be delivered as the Federal Government may direct. This subsection (c), however, does not apply to adaptations of automatic data processing equipment or programs for the Authority or Contractor's use whose costs are financed in whole or in part with Federal assistance provided by FTA for transportation capital projects. Unless prohibited by state law, upon request by the Federal Government, the Authority and the Contractor agree to indemnify, save, and hold harmless the Federal Government, its officers, agents, and employees acting within the scope of their official duties against any liability, including costs and expenses, resulting from any willful or intentional violation by the Authority or Contractor of proprietary rights, copyrights, or right of privacy, arising out of the publication, translation, reproduction, delivery, use, or disposition of any data furnished under that contract. Neither the Authority nor the Contractor shall be required to indemnify the Federal Government for any such liability arising out of the wrongful act of any employee, official, or agents of the Federal Government.

(d)

69   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

(e)

Nothing contained in this clause on rights in data shall imply a license to the Federal Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Federal Government under any patent. Data developed by the Authority or Contractor and financed entirely without using Federal assistance provided by the Federal Government that has been incorporated into work required by the underlying contract to which this Attachment has been added is exempt from the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this clause, provided that the Authority or Contractor identifies that data in writing at the time of delivery of the contract work. Unless FTA determines otherwise, the Contractor agrees to include these requirements in each subcontract for experimental, developmental, or research work financed in whole or in part with Federal assistance provided by FTA.

(f)

(g)

(3)

Unless the Federal Government later makes a contrary determination in writing, irrespective of the Contractor's status (i.e. , a large business, small business, state government or state instrumentality, local government, nonprofit organization, institution of higher education, individual, etc.), the Authority and the Contractor agree to take the necessary actions to provide, through FTA, those rights in that invention due the Federal Government as described in U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, "Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements," 37 C.F.R. Part 401. The Contractor also agrees to include these requirements in each subcontract for experimental, developmental, or research work financed in whole or in part with Federal assistance provided by FTA.

(4)

b.

Patent Rights - The following requirements apply to each contract involving experimental, developmental, or research work: (1) General - If any invention, improvement, or discovery is conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the contract to which this Attachment has been added, and that invention, improvement, or discovery is patentable under the laws of the United States of America or any foreign country, the Authority and Contractor agree to take actions necessary to provide immediate notice and a detailed report to the party at a higher tier until FTA is ultimately notified. Unless the Federal Government later makes a contrary determination in writing, irrespective of the Contractor's status (a large business, small business, state government or state instrumentality, local government, nonprofit organization, institution of higher education, individual), the Authority and the Contractor agree to take the necessary actions to provide, through FTA, those rights in that invention due the Federal Government as described in U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, "Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements," 37 C.F.R. Part 401.

(2)

70   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

The Contractor also agrees to include the requirements of this clause in each subcontract for experimental, developmental, or research work financed in whole or in part with Federal assistance provided by FTA.

30.

PATENT INDEMNITY a. If the amount of this Contract is in excess of $10,000, the Contractor shall indemnify the Authority and its officers, agents, and employees against liability, including costs, for infringement of any United States letters patent arising out of the manufacture or delivery of supplies under this Contract. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply unless the Contractor shall have been informed as soon as practicable by the Authority of the suite or action alleging such infringement, and shall have been given such opportunity as is afforded by applicable laws, rules, or regulations to participate in the defense thereof; and further, such indemnity shall not apply to: (1) an infringement resulting from compliance with specific written instructions of the Contracting Officer directing a change in the supplies to be delivered or in the materials or equipment to be used, or directing a manner or performance of the Contract not normally used by the Contractor; an infringement resulting from addition to, or change in, such supplies or components furnished which addition or change was made subsequent to delivery or performance by the Contractor; or a claimed infringement which is settled without the consent of the Contractor, unless required by final decree of court of competent jurisdiction.

(2) (3)

31.

PAYMENTS a. The Contractor shall be paid, upon the submission of proper invoices or vouchers, the prices stipulated herein for supplies delivered and accepted or services rendered and accepted, less deductions, if any, as specified. For those contracts which exceed $100,000 and to which Appendix 'B' applies, the failure to perform in accordance with the said Appendix may result in partial or full suspension of payment and/or progress payments. If the Contractor meets his goal as required by Appendix 'B' of this contract titled Disadvantaged/Women Business Enterprise (DBE/WBE) or if the Contractor demonstrates that every reasonable effort has been made to meet its goal, the Contractor shall be presumed to be in compliance with said Appendix. But, if the Contracting Officer finds the Contractor not to be in compliance with said Appendix, the progress of the work shall also be deemed to be unsatisfactory and there shall be retained from payment (or progress payments) made to the Contractor pursuant to this Article of the General Provisions an amount equal to the DBE/WBE participation in the Contract. Additionally, if the Contractor fails to submit monthly DBE reports, the Contracting Officer may suspend payment (or progress payments) until such time as the monthly reports have been submitted and accepted by the Authority.

b.

c.

32.

PAYMENT DEDUCTIONS - NONCOMPLIANCE WITH DBE REQUIREMENTS (a) For federally funded contracts that exceed $100,000 and to which the Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) Requirements (Appendix B) apply, the failure to perform

71   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

in accordance with requirements of Appendix B may result in a partial or full suspension of payment, including progress payments, if applicable. (b) If the Contractor is found to be in noncompliance with the DBE requirements of Appendix B, the progress of the work shall also be deemed to be unsatisfactory, and an amount equal to the DBE participation in the Contract shall be retained from payment (or progress payments, if any) made to the Contractor. If the Contractor fails to submit the required monthly DBE reports, the Contracting Officer may suspend payment (or progress payments) until such time as the monthly reports are submitted and accepted by the Authority.

(c)

33.

PRICE REDUCTION FOR DEFECTIVE COST OR PRICING DATA -- PRICE ADJUSTMENTS a. This article shall become operative only with respect to any modification of this Contract which involves aggregate increases and/or decreases in costs plus applicable profits in excess of $100,000 unless the modification is priced on the basis of adequate competition, established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public, or prices set by law or regulation. The right to price reduction under this article is limited to defects in data relating to such modification. If any price, including profit, or fee, negotiated in connection with any price adjustment under this Contract was increased by any significant sums because: (1) The Contractor furnished cost or pricing data which was not complete, accurate and current as certified in the Contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data; A subcontractor, pursuant to the articles of this Contract entitled SUBCONTRACTOR COST OR PRICING DATA or SUBCONTRACTOR COST OR PRICING DATA--PRICE ADJUSTMENTS or any subcontract clause therein required, furnished cost or pricing data which was not complete, accurate and current as certified in the subcontractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data; A subcontractor or prospective subcontractor furnished cost or pricing data which was required to be complete, accurate and current and to be submitted to support a subcontract cost estimate furnished by the Contractor but which was not complete, accurate and current as of the date certified in the Contractor's Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data; or The Contractor or a subcontractor or prospective subcontractor furnished any data, not within (1) or (3) above, which was not accurate, as submitted; the price shall be reduced accordingly and the Contract shall be modified in writing as may be necessary to reflect such reduction. However, any reduction in the Contract price due to defective subcontract data of a prospective subcontractor, when the subcontract was not subsequently awarded to such subcontractor, will be limited to the amount (plus applicable overhead and profit markup) by which the actual subcontract, or the actual cost to the Contractor, if there was no subcontract, was less than the prospective subcontract cost estimate submitted by the Contractor, provided

b.

(2)

(3)

(4)

72   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

that the actual subcontract price was not affected by defective cost or pricing data. NOTE: Since the Contract is subject to reduction under this article by reason of defective cost or pricing data submitted in connection with certain subcontracts, it is expected that the Contractor may wish to include an article in each such subcontract, requiring the subcontractor to appropriately indemnify the Contractor. However, the inclusion of such an article and the terms thereof are matters for negotiation and agreement between the Contractor and the subcontractor and are not binding upon the Authority. It is also expected that any subcontractor subject to such indemnification will generally require substantially similar indemnification for defective cost or pricing data required to be submitted to his lower tier subcontractors. 34. PRICING OF ADJUSTMENTS a. When costs are a factor in any determination of a Contract price adjustment pursuant to the CHANGES AND CHANGED CONDITIONS article or any other provision of this Contract, such costs shall be in accordance with the Subpart 31.1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR 31.1). Notwithstanding any interpretation of the aforementioned contract cost principles and procedures to the contrary, the Authority will not be liable for interest, however represented, on or as a part of any claim, request, proposal or adjustment, including equitable adjustments, whether said claim, request, proposal or adjustment, including equitable adjustments, arises under the Contract or otherwise. Where general and administrative expense is recoverable as part of any pricing adjustment under this contract, the adjustment shall be based on the relationship between the Contractors' total general and administrative expenses allowable under FAR cost principles for all construction-type operations during the fiscal or calendar year covering the actual performance period of the work included in this pricing adjustment, and the Contractor's total cost input (excluding General and Administrative costs) for construction-type operations during the same period, expressed as a percentage, applied to the direct and overhead contract costs included in the pricing adjustment.

c.

35.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSPECTION Notwithstanding the requirements for any Authority inspection and test contained in Specifications applicable to this Contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the Authority, the Contractor shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies and services provided under the Contract conform to the Drawings, Specifications and Contract requirements.

36.

RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS Except where this Contract specifically requires otherwise, the Contractor shall retain for a period of three (3) years from final payment, all research and supporting documentation, work papers and other documents, whether written or electronic, used in the performance of services for this Contract.

c.

Technical data provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraph b. shall be identified by a legend which suitably recites the aforesaid limitation.

88   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

the Project to participants in the Project. Therefore, unless FTA determines otherwise, the Contractor agrees that, in addition to the rights set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this clause, FTA may make available to any FTA recipient, subrecipient, third party contractor, or third party subcontractor, either FTA's license in the copyright to the subject data derived under this contract or a copy of the subject data first produced under this contract.

Unless prohibited by state law, the Contractor agrees to indemnify, save, and hold harmless WMATA and the Government, their officers, agents, and employees acting within the scope of their official duties against any liability, including costs and expenses, resulting from any willful or intentional violation by the contractor of proprietary rights, copyrights, or right of privacy, arising out of the publication, translation, reproduction, delivery, use, or disposition of any data furnished under this Contract. The Contractor shall not be required to indemnify WMATA and the Government for any such liability arising out of the wrongful acts of employees or agents of WMATA and the Government. Nothing contained in this section on rights in data shall imply a license to WMATA or the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to WMATA or the Government under any patent.

CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL a. The Contractor shall replace employees who the Authority judges to be incompetent, careless, unsuitable or otherwise objectionable, or whose continued use is deemed contrary to the best interests of the program. The reason for replacement will be discussed between the Contractor and the Authority before a replacement request is issued. Upon receipt of a written request from the Authority, the Contractor shall proceed with the replacement unless the Contractor is able to demonstrate that the Authority's request is unreasonable. The replacement request will include the desired replacement date and the reason for the request. The Contractor shall effect the replacement in a manner that does not impact quality, cost or schedule. Contractor personnel required to work on WMATA property must obtain a WMATA vendors badge and successfully complete the mandatory safety training which must be renewed yearly. To obtain a vendors badge a signed waiver to perform a background check will be required.

b.

11.

PRE-EMPLOYMENT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENT Criminal background checks of all contractor employees working at a WMATA facility on this contract will be required. Eligibility for access to WMATA property will be based on WMATA's pre-employment Criminal Background Check criteria. WMATA will provide the contractor employees with background check consent forms that the contractor employees must complete and sign. The forms will require the contractor employees to appear in person, provide their full legal names, including middle initials if applicable, as well as their Social Security numbers, in addition to other information that will be necessary to conduct the background checks. The operating hours are Monday through Friday from 7:30AM B 3:30PM except holidays. Upon receipt of the completed, signed forms, WMATA will conduct background checks including criminal court searches and Social Security Number verifications of the contractor employees. If there is derogatory information that would disqualify a contractor employee from receiving a badge to access WMATA property, the Contractor and its contractor employee will be notified that the background check failed. The completed forms are secured in a locked file cabinet and are destroyed one year after the expiration date on the contractor employees badge. These background checks are expected to take one (1) business day for processing, so the contractor employee must allow sufficient time for completion. The background check is free of charge. Background checks are conducted to promote a safe work environment and to protect our company's most important assets: the people we serve and the people with whom we serve. This enables WMATA management in making prudent decisions and maintaining a high quality workforce. Contractor employees who successfully complete the background checks are eligible to enter WMATA property once they are issued a contractor badge. On the other hand, contractor employees who do not authorize background checks or whose background checks are unsatisfactory will not be granted contractor badges or access to WMATA

93   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

property. The records generated by these background checks that contain private information will not be disclosed unless disclosure is required under the PARP/Privacy Policies. 12. MOST FAVORED CUSTOMER The Contractor shall voluntarily provide the Authority with the benefits of any more favorable terms it has, or negotiates, with any organization or facility whose circumstances and operations are substantially the same as those of the Authority. 13. CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE WORK The Contractor shall be responsible for having taken steps reasonably necessary to ascertain the nature and extent of the work, and the general and local conditions which can affect the work or the cost thereof. Any failure by the Contractor to do so will not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for successfully performing work without additional expense to the Authority. The Authority assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representations concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of this Contract, unless such understanding or representations are expressly stated in the Contract. 14. WARRANTY a. Any failure of the work in compliance with the procedures that does not conform to the part order, and or defects of material for a period of one (1) year shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor at his expense. b. Damage to equipment or the contents thereof in fulfilling this contract and warranty shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor shall be liable for any and all damages, including consequential damages, arising from a breach of this warranty. No other provision of this contract shall be construed to limit the Contractor's liability for a breach of this warranty. 15. INDEMNITY a. Contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Authority, its directors, officers, employees and agents, from all liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, claims, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), of whatsoever kind and nature for injury, including personal injury or death of any person or persons, and for loss or damage to any property, including the property of the Contractor and the Authority, occurring in connection with, or in any way arising out of the use, occupancy and performance of the work and/or any acts in connection with activities to be performed under this contract, unless the loss or damage is due to the sole negligence of the Authority. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to relieve Contractor from ultimate liability for any obligation of Contractor under this Contract. Contractor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Authority its directors, officers, employees and agents against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, demands, damages, penalties, costs, charges, remedial costs, environmental claims, fees or other expenses including attorneys fees, related to, arising from or attributable to any effluent or other hazardous waste, residue, contaminated soil or other similar material discharged from, removed from, or introduced on, about or

b.

94   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

under the job site, unless the loss or damage is due to the sole negligence of the Authority. c. If any action or proceeding relating to the indemnification required is brought against the Authority, then upon written notice from the Authority to the Contractor, the Contractor shall, at the Contractor's expense, resist or defend such action or proceeding by counsel approved by the Authority in writing, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, but no approval of counsel shall be required where the cause of action is resisted or defended by counsel of any insurance carrier obligated to resist or defend the same. The Authority reserves the right to use its own counsel under this indemnity at Contractor's sole cost and expense. Contractor understands and agrees that it is Contractor's responsibility to provide indemnification to the Authority pursuant to this Section. The provision of insurance, while anticipated to provide a funding source for this indemnification, is in addition to any indemnification requirements and the failure of Contractor's insurance to fully fund any indemnification shall not relieve the Contractor of any obligation assumed under this indemnification.

FEDERAL/LOCAL/STATE SALES TAX a. Pursuant to Article XVI., Paragraph 78., of the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority Compact, as adopted by the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, with the authorization and consent of the Congress of the United States, the Authority has been accorded exemption from taxes as follows: "the Authority and the Board shall not be required to pay taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired by it or under its jurisdiction, control, possession or supervision, or upon its activities in the operation and

97   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

maintenance of any transit facility or upon any revenues therefrom, and the property and income derived therefrom shall be exempted from all Federal, State, District of Columbia, municipal, and local taxation. This exemption shall include without limitation, all motor vehicle license fees, sales taxes and motor fuel taxes." b. It has been the practice of the District of Columbia to apply the Authority's tax exempt status to certain purchases of materials required under Authority construction contracts and acquired by Contractor for physical incorporation into the project work. This has not been the practice in either Maryland or Viginia. The Authority does not represent or warrant that the District of Columbia practice applies to this project or, if it does, that it will continue in effect during the term of this project. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine its liability for any and all taxes applicable to this project. Assessment or payment of taxes by the Contractor, including taxes resulting from changes in existing laws or the application thereof or of new or additional taxes, shall not constitute the basis for an increase in the Contract price, except as otherwise allowed under Section 00779, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX. By submission of its proposal, the proposer certifies that none of the taxes as to which the Authority is exempt are included in its proposal price(s) or the final Contract Price. In the event that the Authority learns that any taxes to which the Authority is exempt are included in the final Contract Price, the Authority shall be entitled to a reduction in the Contract Price reflecting such amount and a refund of monies paid related to such taxes, plus applicable interest.

1.

DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE) REQUIREMENT: A. The DBE requirements of the Authority's DBE Program Plan apply to this Contract. Accordingly, the Contractor shall carry out the requirements of the Authority's DBE Program Plan and this Appendix in the award and administration of U.S. Department of Transportation (US DOT) assisted contracts.

2.

POLICY: A. It is the policy of the Authority (WMATA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the US DOT that Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE's) shall compete fairly to receive and participate in performing federally assisted contracts, including contracts and subcontracts at any tier. It is further the policy of the Authority, the FTA and the US DOT that its prime contractors establish procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of their subcontracts. The Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the award and administration of subcontracts to the fullest extent possible consistent with efficient Contract performance.

3.

CONTRACT GOAL: A. If the bidder/proposer is not a DBE, then the bidder/proposer agrees that the DBE goal for this Contract will be met by subcontracts or by joint ventures with DBE's. The goal set forth for this Contract is TBD % of the final Contract price, including amendments and modifications. The amount of DBE participation will be determined by the dollar value of the work performed and/or supplies furnished by DBE firms as compared to the total value of all work performed and/or supplies furnished under this Contract. The Contractor shall have met this goal if the Contractor's DBE participation meets or exceeds this goal. In cases where work is added to the Contract by modification such that additional DBE participation is necessary to meet this goal, the Contractor shall increase the participation of one or more firms listed on the "Schedule of DBE Participation" or submit additional DBE firms to meet the goal. In cases where work is deleted from the Contract, the goal shall be applicable to the new Contract amount. The Contractor shall be permitted to meet the goal by revising its DBE participation, provided, however, that the revision shall not result in DBE participation that is less than the original goal.

B.

~Applies only if bid/proposal price is $500,000 or more for a construction contract or $100,000 or more for a supply and service contract.

DEFINITIONS: A. Contractor. Contractor means one who participates, through a contract or subcontract (at any tier), in a US DOT assisted highway, transit or airport program. DBE. A DBE means a for-profit small business concern that is at least 51% owned by one or more individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or, in the case of a corporation, in which 51 percent of the stock is owned by one or more such individuals; and whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more of the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who own it. Good Faith Efforts. "Good faith efforts" means efforts to achieve a DBE goal or other requirements of the Authority's DBE Program Plan which by their scope, intensity, and appropriateness to the objective, can reasonably be expected to fulfill the goal program requirement. Joint Venture. Joint Venture means an association of a DBE firm and one or more other firms to carry out a single, for-profit business enterprise, for which the parties combine their property, capital, efforts, skills and knowledge, and in which the DBE is responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract and whose share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the joint venture is commensurate with its ownership interest. Personal Net Worth. Personal net worth means the net value of the assets of an individual remaining after total liabilities are deducted. An individual's personal net worth does not include the individual's ownership interest in an applicant or participant DBE firm; or the individual's equity in his or her primary place of residence. An individual's personal net worth includes only his or her own share of assets held jointly or as community property with the individual's spouse. Race-conscious. Race-conscious means a measure or program this is focused specifically on assisting only DBEs, including women-owned DBEs. Race-neutral. Race-neutral means a measure or program that is, or can be, used to assist all small businesses. For the purposes of the DBE program, raceneutral includes gender -neutrality. Small Business Concern. Small business concern means, with respect to firms seeking to participate as DBE's in US DOT assisted contracts, a small business concern as defined pursuant to Section 3 of the Small Business Act and Small Business Administration regulations implementing it (13 CFR Part 121) that also does not exceed the cap on average annual gross receipts specified in 49 CFR Part 26.65(b).

US DOT Assisted Contract. US DOT assisted contract means any contract between the Authority and a contractor (at any tier) funded in whole or in part with US DOT financial assistance, including letters of credit or loan guarantees.

5.

HOW DBE PARTICIPATION IS COUNTED TOWARDS THE CONTRACT GOAL: DBE participation shall be counted towards meeting the DBE goal in accordance with the following: A. When a DBE participates in a contract, only the value of the work actually performed by the DBE is counted towards the DBE goal. (1) This amount includes the entire amount of that portion of a construction contract that is performed by the DBE's own forces. This amount includes the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the DBE for the work of the contract, including supplies purchased or equipment leased by the DBE (except supplies and equipment the DBE subcontractor purchases or leases from the prime contractor or its affiliate). 113 

 

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

(2)

This amount includes the entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a DBE firm for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant, or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of the contract, towards the DBE goal, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. When a DBE subcontracts part of its work under the contract to another firm, the value of the subcontract work may be counted towards the DBE goal only if the DBE's subcontractor is itself a DBE. Work that a DBE subcontracts to a non-DBE firm does not count towards the DBE goal.

(3)

B.

When a DBE performs as a participant in a joint venture, the portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract that a DBE performs with its own forces towards the DBE goal may be counted. Expenditures to a DBE contractor towards the DBE goal may be counted only if the DBE is performing a commercially useful function on that contract. (1) A DBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. To perform a commercially useful function, the DBE must also be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, and installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. To determine whether a DBE is performing a commercially useful function, the Authority will consider the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and the DBE credit claimed for its performance of the work, and other relevant factors. A DBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of DBE participation. If a DBE does not perform or exercise responsibility for at least 30 percent of the total cost of its contract with its own work force, or if the DBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practice for the type of work, the Authority will presume that the DBE is not performing a commercially useful function.

C.

(2)

(3)

D.

The following factors will be used by the Authority in determining whether a DBE trucking company is performing a commercial useful function: (1) The DBE must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation for which it is responsible for on a particular 114 

 

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

contract, and there cannot be a contrived arrangement for the purpose of meeting the DBE goal. (2) (3) The DBE must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured and operational truck used on the contract. The DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services it provides on the contract using trucks it owns, insures, and operates using drivers, it employs. The DBE may lease trucks from another DBE firm, including an owneroperator who is certified as a DBE. The DBE who leases trucks from another DBE receives credit for the total value of the transportation services the lessee DBE provides on the contract. The DBE may also lease trucks from a non-DBE firm, including an owneroperator. The DBE who leases trucks from a non-DBE is entitled to credit only for the fee or commission it receives as a result of the lease arrangement. The DBE does not receive credit for the total value of the transportation services provided by the lessee, since these services are not provided by a DBE. The lease must indicate that the DBE has exclusive use of and control over the truck. This does not preclude the leased truck from working for others during the terms of the lease with the consent of the DBE, so long as the lease gives the DBE absolute priority for use of the leased truck. Leased trucks must display the name and identification number of the DBE.

(4)

(5)

(6)

E.

The following factors will be used to count expenditures with DBE's for materials or supplies towards the DBE goal: (1) If the materials or supplies are obtained from a DBE manufacturer, 100 percent of the cost of the materials or supplies will be counted towards the DBE goal. A manufacturer is a firm that operates or maintains a factory or establishment that produces, on the premises, the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment required under the contract and of the general character described by the contract. If the materials or supplies are purchased from a DBE regular dealer, 60 percent of the cost of the materials or supplies will be counted towards the DBE goal. A regular dealer is a firm that owns, operates or maintains a store, warehouse, or other establishment in which the materials, supplies, articles or equipment of the general character described and required under the contract are bought, kept in stock, and regularly sold or leased to the public in the usual course of business. To be a regular dealer, the firm must be an established, regular business that engages, as its principal business and under its own name, in the purchase and sale or lease of the products in question. A person may be a regular dealer in such bulk items as petroleum products, steel, cement, gravel, stone or asphalt without owning, operating, or maintaining a place of 115 

(2)

 

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

business as provided in this paragraph if this person both owns and operates distribution equipment for the products. Any supplementing of regular dealers' own distribution equipment shall be by long-term lease agreement and not on an ad hoc or contract-by-contract basis. Packagers, brokers, manufacturers' representatives, or other persons who arrange or expedite transactions are not regular dealers within the meaning of this paragraph. (3) With respect to materials or supplies purchased from a DBE which is neither a manufacturer nor a regular dealer, the entire amount of fees or commissions charged for assistance in the procurement of the materials and supplies, or fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials and supplies required on a job site, may be counted towards the DBE goal, provided the fees are reasonable and are not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. The cost of the materials and supplies themselves may not be counted towards the DBE goal.

F.

Participation by a firm that is not currently certified as a DBE by the Authority at the time of contract award, does not count towards the DBE goal. Effective March 4, 2002, all DBE firms must be pre-certified: certification of firms must be in place prior to the due date of bids and proposals on which the firm wishes to participate as a DBE. The dollar value of work performed under the contract by a firm whose DBE certification has expired, does not count towards the DBE goal. The participation of a DBE subcontractor does not count towards the Contractor's DBE goal until the amount being counted towards the goal has been paid to the DBE.

G. H.

BID AND PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS (WITH THE BID/PROPOSAL): The bidder/proposer shall submit the following with their bid/proposal. Any bidder/proposer who fails to complete and return this information with their bid/proposal shall be deemed to be not responsible and may be ineligible for contract award. Bidders/proposers that fail to meet the DBE goal above and fail to demonstrate "good faith efforts" to justify waiver of the DBE goal (see paragraph 6.C. below) shall be deemed to be not responsible and will be ineligible for Contract award. A. Completed "Schedule of DBE Participation" (Page B-12) with WMATA precertified DBEs sufficient to meet the above goal. If the bidder/proposer is a DBE firm and intends to satisfy the appropriate DBE requirement with its own firm, he/she must indicate in the Schedule the area of work and percentage it will perform to satisfy the goal. Executed "Letters of Intent to Perform as a Subcontractor/Joint Venture" (Page B-13). If the bidder/proposer is not a DBE then he/she must attach these letters from each DBE listed on the Schedule.

C.

Justification for grant of relief (waiver of DBE goal). If in the submittal of its bid/proposal, the bidder/proposer fails to meet the DBE goal above, the bidder/proposer has the burden of furnishing sufficient documentation with its bid/proposal of its "good faith efforts" to justify a grant of relief (waiver) from the goal or portion of the goal. Such justification shall be in the form of a detailed report. The following is a list of actions which shall be considered as part of the bidder's/proposer's good faith efforts to obtain DBE participation. This list is neither a mandatory checklist nor is it intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. Other factors or types of efforts may be relevant in appropriate cases: (1) Soliciting through all reasonable and available means (e.g. attendance at pre-bid/proposal meetings, advertising and/or written notices) the interest of all certified DBE's who have the capability to perform the work of the contract. The bidder/proposer must solicit this interest within sufficient time to allow the DBE's to respond to the solicitation. The bidder/proposer must determine with certainty if the DBE's are interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations. Selecting portions of the work to be performed by DBE's in order to increase the likelihood that the DBE goal will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate DBE participation, even when the prime contractor might otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. Providing interested DBE's with adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract in a timely manner to assist them in responding to a solicitation. (a) Negotiating in good faith with interested DBE's. It is the bidder's/proposer's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to DBE subcontractors and suppliers and to select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the available DBE subcontractors and suppliers, so as to facilitate DBE participation. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of DBE's that were considered; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached for DBE's to perform the work. "DBE Unavailability Certifications" (Page B-14) shall be completed as appropriate. (b) A bidder/proposer using good business judgment would consider a number of factors in negotiating with subcontractors, including DBE subcontractors, and would take a firm's price and capabilities as well as the contract goal into consideration. However, the fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using DBE's is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidder's/proposer's failure to meet the contract DBE goal, as long as such costs are reasonable. Also, the ability or desire of a prime contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve the bidder/proposer of the responsibility to make good faith efforts. Prime contractors are not, however, required to 117 

(2)

(3)

(4)

 

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

accept higher quotes from DBE's if the price difference is excessive or unreasonable. (5) Not rejecting DBE's as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. The contractor's standing within its industry, membership in specific groups, organizations, or associations and political or social affiliations (for example union vs. nonunion employee status) are not legitimate causes for the rejection or nonsolicitation of bids/proposals in the contractor's efforts to meet the project goal. Making efforts to assist interested DBE's in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as required by the recipient or contractor. Making efforts to assist interested DBE's in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services. Effectively using the services of available minority/women community organizations; minority/women contractors' groups; local, state, and Federal minority/women business assistance offices; and other organizations as allowed on a case-by-case basis to provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of DBE's.

BID AND PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS (APPARENT SUCCESSFUL BIDDER/PROPOSER): In accordance with Article 5, paragraph F, effective March 4, 2002, all DBE firms must be WMATA pre-certified at time of bid/proposal. The bidder/proposer shall submit the following items within ten (10) calendar days after notification that they are the apparent successful bidder/proposer: A. B.

regular dealers/suppliers, the DBE must submit a signed and notarized statement on their letterhead, that they are a regular dealer of the material(s) or supplies. By submission of this statement, the bidder/proposer certifies that it is satisfied that the subcontractor is a regular dealer/supplier that meets the requirements of 49 CFR Part 26. 8. CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION REQUIREMENTS: The following requirements apply after contract award: A. The Contractor shall include the following provision in each subcontract it awards in support of the Appendix B DBE goal: The contractor shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex in the performance of this contract. The contractor shall carry out applicable requirements of 49 CFR Part 26 in the award and administration of US DOT assisted contracts. Failure by the contractor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract, which may result in termination of this contract or such other remedy as the Buyer deems appropriate. B. The Contractor shall monitor the performance of, collect and report data on DBE participation to the Office of Civil Rights, on the attached "Prompt Payment Report-Prime Contractor's Report" (page B-20) and "Prompt Payment ReportSubcontractor's Report" (Page B-21), which shall be submitted monthly with each payment request. Failure to submit these reports may result in suspension of contract payments. The Contractor shall certify with each payment request that payment has been or will be made to all subcontractors due payment, within ten (10) days after receipt of payment from the Authority for work by that subcontractor. The Contractor shall inform the COR or AR, with their payment request, of any situation in which scheduled subcontractor payments have not been made. The Contractor shall have a continuing obligation to maintain a schedule for participation by DBE contractor(s) to meet its goal set forth above in this Appendix. The Contractor shall not have work performed nor the materials or supplies furnished by any individual or firm other than those named in the "Schedule of DBE Participation". If at any time, the Contractor believes or has reason to believe that it needs to obtain a substitute for a DBE contractor named in the "Schedule of DBE Participation", the Contractor shall, within ten (10) days, notify the contracting officer or other delegated authority's representative of that fact in writing. Situations which may warrant substitution for a DBE firm include, but are not limited to the following: (1) (2) (3) Failure to qualify as a DBE. Death or physical disability, if the named subcontractor or DBE partner of the joint venture is an individual. Dissolution, if a corporation or partnership.

(4)

Bankruptcy of the subcontractor, subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and only instances where the bankruptcy affects the Contractor's ability to perform. Inability to furnish a reasonable performance or payment bond, if required. Inability to obtain, or loss of, a license necessary for the performance of the particular category of work. Failure or inability to comply with a requirement of law applicable to contractors and subcontractors on a construction, alteration or repair project. Failure or refusal to execute the subcontract in accordance with the terms of an offer submitted to the Contractor prior to the Contractor's submission of its bid/proposal, but only where the contracting officer or other delegated authority's representative can ascertain with reasonable certainty the terms of such offer. In the absence of any other factors, such a failure or refusal will be considered an unusual situation only if the bidder/proposer obtained, prior to bidding/proposing, an enforcement commitment from the subcontractor involved. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this Contract or those of its subcontract or joint venture agreement.

(5) (6) (7)

(9)

Within 30 days thereafter, the Contractor shall, if necessary to achieve the Appendix B goal, make every reasonable effort to subcontract the same or other work to other DBE firms. The Contractor must have the prior written approval of the contracting officer or other delegated authority's representative and the Office of Civil Rights before substitution for a DBE subcontractor, regardless of the reason for substitution. Failure to obtain Authority approval could result in the Contractor being found non-compliant with the requirements of Appendix B. D. E. The contractor shall forward copies of all subcontracts to the Office of Civil Rights at the time of their execution. If the contracting officer or other delegated authority's representative determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with this Appendix B, he will notify the Contractor of such non-compliance and the action to be taken. The Contractor shall, after receipt of such notice, take corrective action. If the Contractor fails or refuses to comply promptly, the contracting officer or other delegated authority's representative may issue a "stop work order" stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective action has been taken. No part of the time lost due to any such stop work order shall be made the subject of claim for extension of time or for excess costs or damages by the Contractor. When the Authority proceeds with such formal actions, it has the burden of proving that the Contractor has not met the requirements of this Appendix, but the Contractor's failure to meet its Appendix B goal shall shift to it the requirement to come forward with evidence to show that it has met the good faith requirements of this Appendix. Where the Contractor, after exhausting all its administrative and legal remedies and 120   

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY SUPPLY AND SERVICE CONTRACT RFP FQ-12035

procedures is found to have failed to exert a "good faith effort" to involve DBE's in the work as herein provided, the Authority may declare the Contractor ineligible to receive further Authority contracts for three years from the date of the finding. F. The Contractor agrees to cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be conducted by the Authority which are necessary to determine the extent of the Contractor's compliance with this Appendix. The Contractor shall keep records and documents for two years following performance of this Contract to indicate compliance with this Appendix. These records and documents, or copies thereof, shall be made available at reasonable times and places for inspection by any authorized representative of the Authority and will be submitted upon request together with any other compliance information which such representative may require. If the Authority, the FTA or the US DOT has reason to believe that any person or firm has willfully and knowingly provided incorrect information or made false statements regarding the DBE Program, the matter shall be referred to the Office of Civil Rights. Failure by the Contractor to carry out the requirements of this Appendix is a material breach of this Contract, which may result in the termination of this Contract under the Default provision of this Contract or such other remedy as the Authority deems appropriate.

WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA TRANSIT AUTHORITY STATEMENT OF WORK Video Management System Software Development and Configuration Services 1. 1.1 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA or the Authority) was created by an interstate compact in 1967 to plan, develop, build, finance, and operate a balanced regional transportation system in the national capital area. The Authority began building its rail system in 1969, acquired four regional bus systems in 1973, and began operating the first phase of Metrorail in 1976. Today, Metrorail serves 86 stations and has 106 miles of track. Metrobus serves the nation's capital 24 hours a day, seven days a week with 1,500 buses. Metrorail and Metrobus serve a population of 3.4 million within a 1,500-square mile jurisdiction. Metro began its paratransit service, MetroAccess, in 1994; it provides about 1.5 million trips per year. WMATA is in the process of upgrading the Electronic Security Systems installed throughout the authority. As part of this process, WMATA wishes to evaluate and procure a new Video Management System (VMS). WMATA also has an interest in Physical Security Interface Management software and integration. Lastly, WMATA is interested in Video Analytic software and configuration for specific applications. Due to the security sensitive nature of the subject, some aspects of the system design are expressed in general terms. Additional information shall be provided as the procurement and/or contract process develops. A large portion of this project is to be funded by different DHS grants. As such, WMATA must be able to invoice in such a manner that costs may be traceable to specific grants. Additionally, many of the grants have different expiration dates. As such, WMATA must be able to schedule tasks to ensure the project is completed prior to grant expiration dates. OBJECTIVE / PURPOSE The objective of this contract is to acquire a Video Management System (VMS) which consists of a Video Management Software package, a Physical Security Interface Management (PSIM) software package, a Video Analytic software package, and Contractor supplied services to configure and maintain an Electronic Security System (ESS) for fixed infrastructure. The VMS software shall allow for a minimum of 64 cameras or other devices to be connected to each NVR Storage machine. A redundant Authentication and Authorization Master Server shall allow for a minimum of 20,000 NVR Storage machines to be connected. WMATA currently uses a wide range of cameras, and as such, requests a VMS solution that can record and view most cameras on the market today. WMATA also has an

aggressive program underway to install more cameras throughout the rail system. In the future, the majority of the cameras shall be IP, megapixel cameras. 2.4 WMATA seeks a video analytic package to help with observation of cameras. WMATA seeks video analytic solutions that use server processing. Specific applications which must be addressed by video analytics include detecting unauthorized intrusion at the End of Platforms, detecting a breach in the perimeter at Bus Garages and Rail Yards, and detection of persons entering or exiting the wayside at station platforms and other applications to be defined later in the program. Video analytics shall be demonstrated before acceptance by WMATA. Full scale deployment of the video analytics shall be implemented, upon acceptance by WMATA.

PROGRAM MANAGER.

17.1.1 The Contractor shall provide an overall program manager who shall be responsible for the performance of the work. The name and telephone number of the program manager and an alternate shall be provided to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer Representative (COR) in writing prior to the contract start date. The alternate shall act in the capacity of the program manager in the event the program manager is absent. Any change in program manager and alternate shall be provided, in writing, to the Contracting Officer and COR upon replacement of the manager and/or alternate. 17.1.2 The program manager shall have full authority to act for the Contractor on all matters pertaining to the operation of this contract. The program manager shall be available to meet, as necessary, with the COR and/or Contracting Officer to discuss contract performance and/or problem areas. 18. 18.1 NON-COMPLIANCE Memorandum For Record (MFR) ­ If the COTR/QAP finds that the Contractor has deviated from established standard but the deviation has little bearing on the service, the COTR/QAP will document the finding in a MFR. However, if the COTR/QAP repeatedly identifies the same minor finding, it may be an indication that a major finding is occurring because the Contractor has not taken proper steps to prevent recurrence. Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) - When the Contractor fails to meet contract performance requirements, the COTR, QAP, CA, or CO may prepare a CDR. This report is forwarded to the CO for review, and subsequently processed through the Contractor for action/explanation before being returned to the CO. Upon receipt, the CO will review the response and determine whether to accept the Contractor's position, determine corrective action (reduction in the monthly payment due to unacceptable performance, cure notice, show cause, etc.), or take other appropriate contractual action. The Authority reserves the right to make a partial payment for services performed prior to receipt and evaluation of the Contractor's response to a CDR.
