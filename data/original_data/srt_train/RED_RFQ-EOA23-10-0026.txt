This Statement of Work is provided to solicit discounted pricing.  This support contract will be issued for one base year and four option years.



2.0	BACKGROUND:   The U.S. Attorney’s Office has installed an enterprise voice over IP telephone and voice mail system.  Current Contract will expire and this RFQ is to continue uninterrupted dial tone. 



	SCOPE OF WORK:   



Installation must be performed by 5:00 p.m., on 1/22/2010.  Physical installation of the circuit and porting of numbers will not occur on the same date.  The government reserves the right to re-schedule these dates into the future as may be necessary due to extenuating circumstances.



Provider must provide standard install time frame and expedite install time frame options.



Provider shall install service to MDF and extend cabling and termination of circuits in the U.S. Attorney’s computer room space, room 232.  Provider will utilize office provided secure conduit for extensions when applicable.   



Provider shall coordinate the seamless port of phone numbers with existing carrier(s).  These numbers will be provided at time of award.  The main billing number of account to be ported is 208-667-6568.   The government will furnish a “letter of agency” to the provider to allow then to coordinate the port with the previous carrier.  Provider shall provide porting procedures and any reason existing numbers would not be eligible for porting.



Provider shall work with government to schedule an after-hours cutover as specified by the government if necessary.



Provider shall port all numbers associated with service and US Attorney’s business per request at term of agreement if necessary.



 Specifications for the Primary Rate Interface ISDN trunks include:



ISDN PRI trunk (23 B + D channels) with an information-payload data 

rate of 1.472 MB/s and ITU-TSS Q.931 signaling type.  D channel cannot be shared any another ISDN PRI trunk. 



Access to 911 service.  Subscriber shall be able to obtain emergency service/assistance by dialing 911.  The provider shall administer the associated database.



Automatic route selection: Allows call to be routed automatically in accordance with a provider specified routing plan approved by the government.



Caller ID.   Provides the basic capability of passing the calling number and name to the terminating station as well as the PRI ANI on all inbound/outbound calls.



Alternate Number Delivery.   Provides the capability for the government to send an outbound fictitious caller ID.



Dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) or touch tone dialing. 



Intercepts and recorded announcements.  The provider shall provide commercially available network intercepts to recorded announcements when a call cannot be completed.  The following scenarios shall be supported:



		Calls to disconnected numbers 

				Trunks or common equipment feature

				Misdialed numbers to unavailable non-working numbers

				Unauthorized calls



Local number portability.  LNP allows the subscriber to retain the telephone number after changing service providers or physical locations in accordance with guidelines established by the Number Portability Administration (NPAC).



Retention of current phone number.   Provider shall work with government’s current dial-tone provider to ensure the smooth transition of services to the current installed phone numbers. 



IXC Interface: The provider shall provide the following interfaces to connect to an interexchange (long distance) POP (Sprint FTS is the government’s IXC provider).



Provide a maximum of one (1) hour response time for any problem causing significant interruption or impediment of the services.  This shall be one (1) hour from the time the government or contractor detects the system problem.



Provide proactive management of the ISDN PRI T-1 line service. This management shall include providing immediate remedial action to resolve service interruption. The action shall include advising the COTR of any significant outage, re-routing of traffic, utilization of redundant facilities, and all other steps required for the immediate re-instituting of services.

 



Ensure the reliability of the service and have operational up time of no less than 99.99% per year.



Provide access to a centralized troubleshooting and maintenance center/s for reporting network or service trouble, voice quality issues or outages.  Troubleshooting centers must be staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The contractor must respond to trouble reports within one (1) hour of notification and hourly thereafter with updates until the trouble is cleared.

Attachment  1.2



Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza

or other National Emergency



During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 



The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 



The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 



Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 



Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 



Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 



Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 



Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 



Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 



With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 



Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 



Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.





Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 



Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 



It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 



The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
