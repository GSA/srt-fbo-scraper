The order will be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause. Upon receipt of the order, the contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the 19

incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage.

(b) If a stop-work order, issued under this clause, is cancelled or the period of the order of any extension thereof expires, the contractor shall resume work. The contracting officer will make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract will be modified, in writing, accordingly, if: (1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and (2) The contractor asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided that, if the contracting officer decides the facts justify the action, the contracting officer may receive and act upon the claim submitted at any time before final payment under this contract.

F.3 Clause 7-200, Judiciary Delay of Work (Jan 2003) (a) If the performance of all or any part of the work of this contract is delayed or interrupted (1) by an act of the contracting officer in the administration of this contract that is not expressly or impliedly authorized by this contract, or (2) by a failure of the contracting officer to act within the time specified in this contract, or within a reasonable time if not specified an adjustment (excluding profit) will be made for any increase in the cost of performance of this contract caused by the delay or interruption and the contract will be modified in writing accordingly. Adjustment will also be made in the delivery or performance dates and any other contractual term or condition affected by the delay or interruption. However, no adjustment will be made under this clause for any delay or interruption to the extent that performance would have been delayed or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the contractor, or for which an adjustment is provided or excluded, under any other term or condition of this contract. (b) A claim under this clause will not be allowed: (1) for any costs incurred more than 20 days before the contractor shall have notified the contracting officer, in writing, of the act or failure to act involved; and (2) unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted, in writing, as soon as practicable after the termination of the delay or interruption, but not later than the day of final payment under the contract. 20

F.4 Clause 2-30A, Time of Delivery (a) The judiciary requires delivery to be made according to the delivery schedule specified in Section G of the contract schedule. The judiciary will evaluate offerors' proposed delivery schedules to determine the offer with the most advantageous delivery time to the judiciary. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the required delivery period will be deemed unacceptable. The judiciary reserves the right to award on the basis of either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule when an offeror proposes an earlier delivery schedule than required. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule will apply. (b) The required delivery schedule may be stated in terms of days after the effective date of the contract award or specific dates. F.5 Clause 2-30B, Desired and Required Time of Delivery (a) The judiciary desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule: Desired Delivery Schedule Item No. Quantity Within applicable specified time frame (i.e. number of calendar days after award, after contract start date, or after a specified date, etc.) 30 days

ISDN PRI

If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule shall not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the judiciary's required delivery schedule as follows:

21

Required Delivery Schedule Item No. Quantity Within applicable specified time frame (i.e. number of calendar days after award, after contract start date, or after a specified date, etc.) 45 days

ISDN PRI

Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered non-responsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply. Offeror's Proposed Delivery Schedule (Offeror insert specific details) Item No. Quantity Within applicable specified time frame (i.e. number of calendar days after award, after contract start date, or after a specified date, etc.)

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The judiciary will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the contracting officer through the ordinary mails. However, the judiciary will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (5) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (1) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and US federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered non-responsive and rejected. F.6 Period of Performance The period of performance, for this contract, is from the date of contract award through December 1, 2011 with up to four (4) one-year options thereafter. Contract options shall be exercised pursuant to Clause I.2, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.

L.2 Provision 3-210, Protests (Aug 2004) (a) The protestor has a choice of protest forums. It is the policy of the judiciary to encourage parties first to seek resolution of disputes with the contracting officer. If the dispute cannot be resolved with the contracting officer, then it is the policy of the judiciary to encourage parties to seek a judiciary resolution of disputes with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. However, if a party files a formal protest with an external forum on a solicitation on which it has filed a protest with the judiciary, the judiciary protest will be dismissed. (b) Judiciary protests will be considered only if submitted in accordance with the following time limits and procedures: (1) any protest shall be filed in writing with the contracting officer designated in the solicitation for resolution of the protest. It shall identify the solicitation or contract protested and set forth a complete statement of the alleged defects or grounds that make the solicitation terms or the award or proposed award defective. Mere statement of intent to file a protest is not a protest. (2) a protest shall be filed not later than ten (10) calendar days after the basis of the protest is known, or shall have been known. A protest based on alleged improprieties in a solicitation, which are apparent prior to the closing date for receipt of offers, shall be filed prior to the closing date for receipt of offers. The judiciary, in its discretion, may consider the merits of any protest which is not timely filed. The office hours of the Administrative Office are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time. Time for filing a document expires at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the last day on which such filing may be made. 33

(3) the protest shall include the following information: (i) name, address, fax and telephone numbers of the protester or its representative; (ii) solicitation or contract number; (iii) detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, to include a description of resulting alleged prejudice to the protester; (iv) copies of relevant documents; (v) request for a ruling by the judiciary; (vi) statement as to the form of relief requested; (vii) all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest; and (viii) all information establishing the timeliness of the protest. (c) Protests that are filed directly with the judiciary, and copies of any protests that are filed with an external forum, will be served on the contracting officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:

NUMBER 2-85A Evaluation Inclusive of Options

TITLE

DATE Jan 2003

M.2 Evaluation Process M.2.1 Evaluation of Proposals M.2.1.1 General (a) This procurement is being conducted using formal source selection procedures, and contract award will be made to the offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, and is determined to be most advantageous to the Court in accordance with the requirements stated below. (b) The evaluation will be conducted using the evaluation criteria as set forth in this Section. Each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. Proposal 38

clarification/revision requests may be issued which encompass any and all written documentation submitted in response to the RFP as may be deemed necessary by the contracting officer to fully explore and evaluate the merits of proposals submitted. (c) Offerors are hereby notified that the Court may utilize a private contractor to assist in the evaluation of proposals. This contractor will have access to any and all information contained in an offeror's proposal and will be subject to the appropriate conflict of interest, standards of conduct, and confidentiality restrictions. M.2.1.2 Evaluation Approach Each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation shall be evaluated for technical acceptability, technical excellence, and price reasonableness. Proposals shall be initially evaluated for technical acceptability. Only those proposals found technical acceptable will be considered for evaluation of technical excellence, price and contract award. M.2.1.2.1 Technical Acceptability Evaluation To be considered technically acceptable, the proposal shall be evaluated for the following: 1. Contract Compliance: The contractor shall acknowledge the contractor's understanding and acceptance of requirements set forth in the Statement of Work, Sections C.2 through C.8 of the solicitation. This acknowledgment shall, at a minimum, address the criteria established in L.7.1. Any offeror failing to comply with all of the requirements of Section C.2 through C.8 shall be determined to be technically unacceptable, and shall not be considered further for contract award. The Government reserves the right to seek clarifications or deficiency corrections prior to determining a proposal technically unacceptable. M.2.1.2.2 Technical Excellence Evaluation The Technical Excellence Factors will be evaluated to determine which proposal offers the best technical value to the Court. Although price/cost is considered secondary to technical capabilities, it will be a significant criterion for award as part of an integrated assessment with the Technical Excellence Section. The proposals will be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth below: Technical Excellence Factors (a) Installation Requirements (L.7.2) (b) Performance Test Plan (L.7.3) (c) Contention and Resolution Plan (L.7.4) (d) Corporate Experience (L.7.5) (e) Past Performance (L.7.5) With respect to the evaluation of Technical Excellence factors, each factor is of equal importance. For each factor, the evaluation will consist of an assessment of the degree to which the services offered in the proposal provide added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk.

39

M.2.1.2.3 Price Evaluation The offeror's proposed prices will be evaluated for reasonableness. Offers that are unrealistically high or low in price will be considered indicative of a lack of understanding of the complexity and risk associated with the work performed under the contract. Offers that contain unrealistic prices will not be considered for award. The total price for the base period and all option years will be added together resulting in the total evaluated price. M.3 Contract Award The Court will determine, based on its evaluation of technical and price factors, to award a single contract as is determined to provide the best value to the Court. Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best overall value to the Court, given the outcome of the Court's evaluation of each offeror's technical proposal and price. In selecting the best overall value, the Court will consider the quality offered for the evaluated price. The relative quality of offers will be based upon the Court's assessment of the tradeoffs between the technical excellence offered in the proposal and whether it provides added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk. M.4 Provision 3-70, Determination of Responsibility (Jan 2003) A determination of responsibility will be made on the apparent successful offeror(s) prior to contract award. If the prospective contractor is found non-responsible, that offeror will be rejected and will receive no further consideration for award. In the event a contractor is rejected based on a determination of nonresponsibility, a determination will be made on the next apparent successful offeror.
