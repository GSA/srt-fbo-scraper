Deliverables
The Government will interact with the contractor frequently. Bi-weekly meetings will be held at which the contractor shall provide a formal
status on the deliverables expected.
The Government expects the contrator to follow the schedule outlined below. The Government will have 5 business days to review the deliverable
and either accept it or identify deficiencies requiring revision. The corrected deliverable will be due within 5 business days of the contractor
receiving the documented deficiencies.
