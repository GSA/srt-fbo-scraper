             FDA 1335 Personnel Security Clearance Requirements

      FDA 1335 Personnel Security Clearance Requirements (Aug 2006)


      1. BACKGROUND


      The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that DHHS
      employees and contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have
      access to DHHS equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation of some
      type.


      Contractor employees who will be in DHHS-owned or lease space for less than thirty (30) days are exempted from the background investigation
      requirement. These contractor employees must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space

      2. GENERAL


      The contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer, ten (10) calendar days prior to
      commencement of work under this contract:

   a. Certification that all required security form packets and a list of contractor  employees names for whom the requisite security information
      has been provided to Division of Security Operations, Policy and Planning, Personnel Security Staff.


      b. "Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement"  forms signed by each employee named in paragraph a. above.


      With the exception of costs associated with fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the
      Government will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the contractor. The cost of fingerprinting Contractor
      employees at any location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor.


      Contractor employees shall obtain security badges in order to access to DHHS-owned or leased property without an escort. (See Section 3 for
      details on the badging process) However, in the event that work must commence before security badges can be issued, contractor employees
      will be allowed onto DHHS-owned or leased property, but must be escorted at all times.


      All Contractor employees who undergo a background investigation are required to log onto the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM’s)
      Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) system to complete the forms necessary to initiate their background
      investigations. The forms required vary with the position risk levels for the contract.


      The position risk levels for this contract are Level 1.


      There are two (2) potential position risk levels, which are:


     a.   Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1) (SEE CHART A) - Positions which involve the lowest degree of adverse impact on the efficiency of the
        Agency. The forms set forth by CHART A are required for Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1). Contractor employees assigned to Level 1 who
        receive a security badge will be required to provide additional security information for a background investigation as specified in
        Paragraph 5 below.


   b. Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6) (SEE CHART B) - Positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public
      confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned Government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs. The forms
      set forth by CHART B are required for Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6). Contractor employees assigned Levels 5 or 6 must receive
      security badge as well as a background investigation.


      In order to access the e-QIP system, Contractor employees must provide the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist with the following
      information: (a) full name; (b) position title; (c) social security number; (d) date of birth; (e) place of birth; (f) email address; and
      (g) phone number. The Personnel Security Specialist will use this information to initiate each Contractor employee into the e-QIP system.
      Once this is done, each Contractor employee will receive an email that contains a web link to access the e-QIP system, as well as
      instructions and additional forms needed to initiate the suitability background investigation. The Project Officer for the contract will
      provide the name of the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist to the Contractor.


      A Contractor’s failure to comply with the e-QIP processing guidelines will result in that Contractor’s employees being denied access to FDA
      property until all security processing has been completed.


      3. BADGING PROCESS


      The FDA Project Officer will sponsor Contractor employees on the FDA Form 3391 for the purpose of obtaining an FDA Security Access Card. In
      order to obtain one, a contractor employee must receive a “favorable” fingerprint return. Fingerprints must be submitted to the Personnel
      Security Office at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work.  Fingerprints will be submitted in one of two ways, depending on
      where the contract will be performed:

   a. Contractor employees who will work in the Washington D.C. metro area will, at the direction of the FDA Project Officer or his/her designee,
      contact the Personnel Security Branch to schedule a fingerprinting appointment, or








   b. Contractor employees who will work in a field office will submit fingerprints to:

                                                           Food and Drug Administration
                                                          Personnel Security Staff, OSO
                                                                5600 Fishers Lane
                                                               PKLN 15A-22, HFA-640
                                                               Rockville, MD 20857


      Upon the receipt of a “favorable” fingerprint return, each Contractor employee must present two forms of identification in order to receive
      his or her badge. One form of identification must be a government-issued photo identification document. Acceptable forms of photo
      identification are referenced on the FDA Form 3391. Acceptable forms of secondary identification are listed on the back of the I-9 Form.
      This form can be obtained at http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf


      An individual who receives an unfavorable report may appeal that finding by submitting a written request to the Personnel Security Staff.


   1. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS


      The Government shall conduct an additional background investigation for those individuals named to risk Levels 1, 5 and 6 serving under
      this contract.


      Required background investigations may include, but not be limited to:


   1. Review of prior Government/military personnel records;
   2. Review of FBI records and fingerprint files;
   3. Searches of credit bureaus;
   4. Personal interviews; and
   5. Written inquiries covering the subject's background.


      Background investigations will be conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).


      The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of contract performance is maintained pending completion of all appropriate
      background investigations of contractor employees.


      The Contractor shall submit the information required for eQIP access and other requisite forms for the risk level(s) specified. In
      addition, the contractor shall provide a cover letter which includes: the Contractor's name, the contract number, the name of the
      Contracting Officer administering the contract, the names of all Contractor employees' for whom a background check is required and those
      employees’ social security numbers, dates of birth, and former names. This cover letter and all completed forms shall be transmitted, in a
      separate sealed envelope marked, "TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY," to:










                                                           Food and Drug Administration
                                                        OSO/Office of Security Operations
                                                          Attn: Personnel Security Staff
                                                     5600 Fishers Lane, PKLN 15A-22, HFA-640
                                                               Rockville, MD 20857


      The contractor shall send a separate letter to the Contracting Officer that includes the contract number and employee names.


      The contractor shall advise its prospective employees that all standard forms submitted to the FDA will be forwarded to the Office of
      Personnel Management (OPM) for scheduling background investigations.


      Personnel Security Staff will resolve with the contract employee any issues arising out of inaccurate or incomplete forms.


      Employees who have been previously granted a Government security clearance shall advise Personnel Security Staff of the details of such
      clearances to determine if a previous clearance level is suitable for the current FDA position.


      At any time, if a contractor employee for whom security forms have been submitted is terminated or otherwise ceases work under the
      contract, the contractor shall immediately notify Personnel Security Staff, in writing, with copies to the respective FDA Project and
      Contracting Officers.


      The OPM background investigation will take approximately 120 days. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing if an
      employee is denied a clearance. Those individuals who have been cleared by Personnel Security Staff may continue to work under the
      contract. Those who are not cleared must cease work on the contract immediately.


      If a Contractor employee changes job responsibilities under this contract, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, and the
      Government will make a determination whether an additional security clearance is required.


      In the event that a cleared individual is replaced, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and comply with all requirements of
      this clause, as specified herein, prior to the commencement of work by the replacement individual.


      The Contractor shall be responsible for the return of any Government issued security badges to the Project Officer.




      6. NON-PUBLIC DATA PROTECTION


      The contractor shall protect the privacy of all information reported by or about contract employees and shall protect against unauthorized
      disclosure.


                                                     CHARTS A & B ARE APPENDED TO THIS CLAUSE

7. FDA 1350 Access to Non-Public Information

All contractor and subcontractor employees are required to sign the Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-Public Information (NPI) Agreement
(Form FDA 3398) provided as an attachment to this contract. If a person who has signed this agreement resigns, is dismissed, or is otherwise no
longer working on this contract, the Contractor shall notify the FDA Project Officer and the Contracting Officer. Any new contractor or
subcontractor employee assigned to this contract shall sign the form, and the Contractor shall hand-deliver it to the Contracting Officer ten
(10) days prior to said new employee's commencement of work on this contract.

The prime contractor, subcontractors, and consultants shall not be provided nor possess non-public information in any form unless written
approval has been granted, nor shall they have unaccompanied access to an FDA facility unless a facility clearance has been granted.

Briefings

An FDA representative (typically, the Project Officer) will conduct an orientation briefing for the contractor and subcontractor employees. The
briefing will stress: (1) the importance of protecting non-public information; (2) specified computer/IT requirements as outlined in the DHHS
Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook; and (3) the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of non-public information. Briefing
updates will be conducted annually.

The contractor shall brief all contractor employees, subcontractors and consultants regarding the sensitivity of the information to be handled
under the contract and of their responsibility to protect it. The briefing shall stress that the information is non-public and shall not be
disclosed to any unauthorized party. The contractor shall conduct an updated briefing annually and shall submit a report to the FDA Project
Officer within ten (10) days after the briefing which includes: an outline of the briefing; copies of any briefing materials; the date the
briefing was conducted; and the names of the attendees.

If this is an information technology/telecommunications (IT/TC) contract, in addition to the above briefings, the FDA Project Officer and the
FDA Center/Office Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) will brief contractor and subcontractor personnel on security measures required
pertinent to any hardware/software being utilized. Furthermore, appropriate contractor and subcontractor personnel shall attend training courses
as directed by the FDA to fulfill requirements of the Computer Security Act of 1987. These courses are generally one (1) day in length, and
attendance at one (1) course is sufficient. This training will be provided at no cost to the contractor.

Whereas access to non-public information (NPI) from the files of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is required in the performance of my
official duties under Contract Number ___________________________, and between FDA and my employer,____________________________________, I
______________________,
hereby agree that I shall not further release, publish or disclose such information and I shall protect such information entrusted to me in

FDA's request.

4. Report in writing to the FDA Project Officer I am assigned to, all incidents in which unauthorized persons may have gained access to any NPI
entrusted to me.

I understand the provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 331(j), 21 U.S.C. $#167; 360(j), 18 U.S.C. § 1905 and that I am subject to criminal penalties
