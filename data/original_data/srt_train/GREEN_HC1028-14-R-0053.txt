HC1028-14-R-0053 Page 12 of 70

In the past, the contactor was tasked to develop and maintain a 64-bit compliant version of JCSS Scenario Builder and Capacity Planner for software releases 8.0 and 9.0, including maintenance, testing report, documentation, and final software deliverable. 6.4 Task 4 ­ IP and Transport Support 6.4.1 Subtask 1 ­ Provide Integrated IP and Transport Modeling Support The Capacity Planning Branch (EE41) performs network designs and capacity management of the DODIN IP services layer. The Transport Modeling and Analysis Branch (EE42) performs network designs and capacity management of the DODIN transport layer. The IP services layer will more and more depend on the new DODIN Core transport layer, and over the coming year, the Capacity Planning Branch will be continually tasked to develop an integrated series of phased transitional topological designs of the unclassified and classified IP services layer. The transition of current DODIN IP networks to the new DODIN Core will require a transition of all current IP customers plus planning for new customers and customer services to include migration strategies from IPv4 to IPv6. These major changes in the IP services layer must be done in concert with the configuration of the underlying transport layer and its impacts on the reliability and economics (i.e., cost factors) of the IP layer. As the Defense Switched Network (DSN) continues transition to being completely IP-based, the complexity of these topological designs is further magnified. Transition/convergence to IP-based services impacts the planning/modeling processes of multiple layers of the DODIN, and hence several of the COTS Riverbed tools used for DODIN (e.g., PSTN tool, SP GURU). To meet the requirement for modeling/capacity planning/assessing the DODIN under these technological changes, the vendor will exploit existing tool capabilities to the greatest extent, given their expert knowledge of the Riverbed COTS software, and identify revised procedures and provide software customizations of the proprietary COTS tools in use. Objective: The contractor shall provide direct support to the building of DODIN models employing Riverbed's products. These models require inclusion of the operational details of several IP data networks and autonomous systems, the DODIN transport network, and possibly the incorporation of pertinent details and operation of the DODIN ATM network. The models will be worldwide in scope. The effort has several dimensions: The Contractor shall provide support for the following tasks:
       

Examining data sources and forms, selecting, and occasionally experimenting with, alternative means to bring the data into the EE4-licensed Riverbed COTS tool (e.g., PSTN, SP GURU). Developing methodology for data validation, analysis and interpretation (e.g., how to take raw traffic measurements/samples and convert that to a "good" traffic baseline with appropriate conservatism). Defining the application of the modeling tool(s) to specific DISA network questions and problems (e.g., using SP Guru, model end-to-end traffic over three ASNs of different characteristics with customized BGP configurations and IP network links provisioned via the DODIN transport network). Streamlining the model-building process, both through writing adjunct scripts and software for massaging data, and where needed, through adding additional features to SP Guru or PSTN data collection tools (e.g., ASCII import) to accommodate the data. Developing potential modifications to the Riverbed software if needed to properly reflect the characteristics of the DODIN IP and/or transport networks. Assist with gathering transport/IP/traffic requirements to assist with developing DODIN global (CONUS, Eur, Pac) network models using the Opnet SpGuru software. Perform DODIN network performance analyses. Typical analyses shall include end-to-end network latency, network connectivity, network capacity, and network availability. Performance analyses shall be performed on network models developed with Opnet SpGuru software. Perform scenario analyses on the DODIN network. Typical scenario analyses are failure analyses and potential configuration change analyses. Scenario analyses shall be performed on network models developed with Opnet SpGuru software.

HC1028-14-R-0053 Page 13 of 70 The Contractor shall provide support to perform and report on studies related to the operational characteristics of the network(s). A typical assignment in this task area can be one-time, periodic, or continuous depending on the specific network model. These efforts include the need for on-site (i.e., five days/week at the DISA facility) contractor support and the flexibility to engage off-site Riverbed expertise when beneficial, especially to quickly exploit unique expertise. On-site support requires contractor personnel who are cleared at the DoD Secret level. Modeling support that requires cleared personnel would, of course, not be assigned to or started by the contractor until cleared contractor personnel are available. Although the Contractor shall expedite the availability of cleared personnel as within his power, to facilitate use of this contract for expected Government needs, the availability of cleared contractor personnel is not mandatory for commencement of this task. This work will have some or all of the following elements:
 

   

Develop the appropriate methodology for performing the task given the available data. In the iterative process of performing the task and developing the methodology for performing it, streamline/enhance any software components to better support the task. This could involve adding simple usability features, enhancing data collection facilities, streamlining cumbersome tasks through automation, and/or adding design primitives that automate or optimize elements of the task. Define the application within the appropriate RIVERBED product(s) that are specific to the DISA network(s). Develop a set of tutorials and related presentations for DISA use in learning the resulting process and methodology. Provide one or more formal training courses on the results. Provide on-the-job training in the process/methodology to DISA engineers using real world data.

Additionally, general network support is also required on an as available basis. This is envisioned to be provided from a location outside of the Washington DC area. This support will be reported on the monthly report to allow the government to better utilize this valuable resource. The issues encountered, work done, and recommendations under this task area will be summarized in periodic reports as indicated in the table of deliverables. Upon government request, these periodic reports may be delivered in the form of presentations or tutorials. 6.4.2 Subtask 2 ­ Provide NIPR Hardening Modeling Support The contractor shall perform specific modeling of the impact of deploying certain NIPR Hardening devices on the network. IP Hardening devices are anticipated for deployment on the DODIN Unclassified but sensitive IP network (NIPR). These devices will reroute and backhaul a significant portion of DODIN traffic. Routing will in many cases be determined by anycasting a device from multiple locations on the network. It is critical that it be understood how traffic backhaul will impact network capacity and latency, and how the new devices will respond to outage scenarios. Specific modeling of the impact of deploying these devices on the network is required. The Contractor shall provide support for the following but not limited to tasks:
   

Maintaining a baseline model of the DODIN IP backbone, capturing the current topology, relevant network routing and baseline circuit loads. Overlaying traffic from NIPR Hardening appliances onto the model. Using the model to determine routing changes, utilization and latency impact. Using the model to determine how the network will react under NIPR Hardening appliance failure.

The NIPRNET topology data shall be stored in a format compatible with EE41 modeling tools, to include OPNET Modeler and Service Provider Guru (SP Guru). The Contractor shall maintain configuration of all models developed for this effort, including model updates necessitated by new versions of the EE41 modeling tools. An updated baseline model shall be delivered in an electronic format as part of each monthly status report.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.

Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification. (t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

HC1028-14-R-0053 Page 35 of 70 (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or changeof-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an AntiDeficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION (APR 2014)

of (a) Contract line item(s) _____ is/are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $---the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause. (b) For items(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s). (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT". (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.

HC1028-14-R-0053 Page 41 of 70 (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "disputes." (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause. (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "DEFAULT." The provisions of this clause are limited to work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract if fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause. (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT." (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and (D) Have ( ), have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should

HC1028-14-R-0053 Page 45 of 70 the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

HC1028-14-R-0053 Page 56 of 70 (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)
