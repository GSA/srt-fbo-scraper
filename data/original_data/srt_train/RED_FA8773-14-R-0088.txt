                 the following administrative data for each referenced contract submitted:  Offeror’s company name; contracting agency; contract
                 number; brief description of contract; contract type (i.e., fixed price, time and material, etc.); period of performance,
                 identification of any significant achievements or past problems and resolution; and name, address, telephone number, and email
                 address of program manager and Contracting Officer.

            iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages).

                   A.  Contracting Information.
                       (1) Provide the signature block of the individual authorized to make a offer which includes individual’s name, title, e-
                       mail address and phone number.
                       (2) Provide cage code, data universal numbering system (DUNS) number, and tax identification number as registered in the
                       System for Award Management (SAM).
                       (3) Organizational Representatives. Provide a listing, in hierarchal succession of             the Offeror’s points of
           contact delegated specifically for this requirement.                Listing shall include names and titles, phone numbers, fax
           numbers and email                 addresses for each representative.  List shall reflect both contracting and               technical
           representatives for help desk issues and troubleshooting.
                       (4) Evidence of Certification. Certification shall be in accordance with Clause                52.212-4 addendum (v)(3).

           state’s Public               Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA –              Service
           Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA – Certificate of                 Operating Authority).
                       (5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all               applicable remittance
           addresses.
                       (6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.
                   B.  Pricing Information.
           (1) Schedule B Submission
                            a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror’s proposed amounts.  Enter
                            pricing only on the Government Schedule B.  Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of
                            entering pricing.  If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will
                            be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror’s proposal.  Schedule B unit prices shall
                            be limited to two decimal places.
                            b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as “Not Separately Priced” by entering "NSP" in the unit
                            price.  Identify a CLIN/SLIN as “No Charge” by entering "NC" in the unit price.
                            c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing.
                       (2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes.  Therefore, the
                       offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt.  In reference to CLIN 0004 –
                       “Taxes, Fees and Surcharges” (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations,
                       FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges.  Enter
                       only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable.  Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render
                       the proposal being rejected.  Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS estimates.
                       (3) Provide a statement specifying that “all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS”.


      (c) Period of Acceptance of Offers.  The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for
      receipt of offers.

      (e) Multiple offers.  If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject
      to same page limitations.  Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government’s requirement.  Should the Offeror claim
      exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.  Failure to include exceptions
      will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.

      (h) Multiple awards.  This award shall be made on an all or none basis.
                                                     (End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)

(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers—Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the
provision:
      52.212-2 Addendum:
      Evaluation Criteria.  This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors’ past performance history will be
      evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations.  An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive
      determination of responsibility.  By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and
      conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors.  All
      Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability.  Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically
      unacceptable.  Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or
      other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the
      Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the     company has not submitted an offer.  Award will be
      made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the
      evaluation factors described below.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:
           (a)  FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL.  The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis,
           assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable.  Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a
           result of discussions, will be considered for an award.  The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:
            Subfactor 1 – Provider Capability
                 This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities
                 such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces
                 (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability.  Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or
                 leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.

           Subfactor 2 – Local Communications Services.
           This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-
           SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror’s ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.
           Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.

           (b)  FACTOR 2 -- PRICE.  All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times
           the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price.  The
           price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.  The Government reserves
           the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation
           for the services required in this solicitation.

           (c)  FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE.  In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including:  reviewing contract
           references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from
           other Government and commercial sources.  Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope,
           magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated.  When reviewing PPI, judgment will
           be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the
           requirements.  The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror’s ability to
           satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation.  The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall
           performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:
                 (A)  Substantial Confidence – Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the                          Government has a high
expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the                     required effort.
                 (B)Satisfactory Confidence –Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the                            Government has an
expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required                       effort.
                 (C) Limited Confidence –Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the Government                     has a low expectation
that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
                 (D) No Confidence –Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the Government has no       expectation that the Offeror will be
           able to successfully perform the required effort.
                 (E) Unknown Confidence –No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror’s                       performance record is so
limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably                       assigned.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of
relevant past performance or for                   whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated
      favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).
           The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to
           have a performance confidence assessment of “Satisfactory Confidence” or lower.  If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer
           is deemed to have a “Substantial Confidence”       performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the
           best value to    the Government.  If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any
           other offer.
                                                     (End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)

(xi)  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addenda:

      (i)(3) Payment.  IAW FAR Clause 52.232-36(f), Contractor shall submit invoices for certification to the address identified in G-2 of this
      CSA.  After certification, the office identified in G-2 shall provide the Contractor with GPC information for billing.  Payment will be
      made to the Contractor through a charge to the GPC, at the time and for the amount due in accordance with the certified invoice.
      (u) Reporting of Funds.  This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds.  The
      funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.
      (v) Tariff Information.
            (1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer—
                 (i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);
                 (ii)  Before filing any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for     new or changes to applicable
           rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or     any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or
           primarily to the Government; and
                 (iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in      support of or in connection
           with an application under paragraph ii above.
            (2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than    the Contractor files with a
      governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or    conditions of services under this contract. These requirements
      also apply to applications pending      on the effective date of this contract.
            (3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization.   All Offerors shall be local exchange     carriers certificated  (Service
      Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate      of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services
      are being provided.  This    contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction   over the
      particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its  jurisdiction.
            (4) Rates, Charges, and Services.
                 (i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance  with—
                 (A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;
                       (1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and
                       (2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's
                       subscribers;
                 (B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor’s cost
                 experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS.  If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the
                 responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or
                 make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.  The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for
                 failure to follow these requirements.  If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit
                 supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for
                 Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS.
            (ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.
                 (iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory       beginning of service
           or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in  arrears.
                 (iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this    contract, the Government may stop the
           use of any service or facilities furnished under this    contract at any time.  The Government shall pay the contractor all charges
           for services and       facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.
              (v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal.  Examples are overtime pay or special shipment.
              When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor.  The
              Government shall pay expediting charges only when—
                 (A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or
                 (B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.
                 (vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development,    fabrication, or manufacture of
           special equipment is required, the Government may—
                 (A) Provide the equipment; or
                 (B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.  If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the
                 acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.
                 (vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them,
              the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of
              deferral or change.  The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on
              any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.
      (w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services.
           (1)  This CSA authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA# FA8773-09-C-0088.
            (2)  For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until   a release date is
      established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or       termination (including termination for cause or
      government convenience). 
            (3)  The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at  the rates specified in the contract
      until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed       price during this process.  This provision may be exercised more than
      once, but the total extension     of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.  The Contracting Officer may exercise this  provision
      by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.
            (4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and   must be continued without
      interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the     Government or another Contractor, may continue them.  The
      Contractor agrees to –
                 (i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability       charges;
                 (ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a    successor; and
                 (iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.
      (x)  Work Orders.  Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor   through issuance of a local order (DD
Form 1367 or a similar form).  A local order will also be issued for      termination or changes to services.  Services provided without a local
order are not contractually covered.    Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B.  Orders must be signed by the
Communications Systems Officer or designee.
                 (End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)

   based either locally or by region and shall provide all transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and
   design layout needed to perform and provide local access and transport services and functions at the designated demarcation point.  This
   includes the contractor’s ability to install PRIs and the capability to port all currently existing DIDs and CSL(s) where applicable.  These
   services shall include any special items, equipment, wiring or infrastructure to ensure the Contractor’s proposed solution is compatible with
   the government’s current infrastructure.  The contractor is responsible for troubleshooting and maintaining the operation of the circuit up
   to its termination point.  Access to the local exchange shall include:  operator assistance, emergency 911/E911 services/functions,
   circuits/trunks to base DMARC and 911/E911 database maintenance where applicable.  These services shall not include residential/business
   services for non-Government entities or Government Contractors.  Long distance services for  Robins AFB, GA are currently being provided
   under the Networx contract or any subsequent follow-on contract established by DISA for long distance services and charges and are not
   authorized on this CSA. The contractor shall follow all Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Public Utility Commission (PUC), Department
   of Defense (DOD), Air Force (AF) and industry standards for this requirement.    The SOW Appendix 10 defines all current requirements for
   Robins AFB, GA.  Appendix 10 may be modified to incorporate future requirements as they occur.




   1.0.2.   Competitive Economic Advantage Consideration.  The local exchange or Dial Central Office services provided for under the pricing,
   terms, and conditions of this contract are principally intended to meet known installation service requirements and an estimate of the type
   of services that may be required during the term of the contract.  Where the contracting officer determines usage of the contract to be cost
   effective and the contractor providing such services to the Government agrees and has the additional capability to provide services to other
   installations or agencies within 100 miles of the principal place of performance, orders may be placed for such additional services.  When an
   order is placed and the contractor initiates performance, all terms and conditions of this contract shall apply.

2.0.  Documents.  The contractor shall acquire a list of applicable industry standards that shall be followed in the performance of the
contract.  These documents shall be made available to the Government upon request.

3.0.  Requirements.

   3.0.1.   The Appendix 10 will identify the Local Commercial Communications Services required, including characteristics, quantities, and
   locations, as applicable.


   3.0.2.   The Communications Systems Officer (CSO) at the Government installation is responsible for telecommunications activities and will be
   identified in the Appendix 10.  After services are authorized by the 38th Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall coordinate with the CSO
   prior to the installation, removal, expansion, and/or change out of equipment.  Organizational office symbol for the CSO and technical
   representative will be identified in Appendix 10.


   3.0.3.   The Government will provide floor space for the installation of the Contractor’s provided transmission equipment.  The floor space
   shall be limited to accommodate Contractor-provided relay rack(s), 19 to 23 inches wide by 7 feet tall, as ceiling height permits at each
   designated demarcation.  Space is available for 1 or 2 relay rack(s) for Contractor equipment in the Demarcation Building as specified in the
   Appendix 10 of this SOW.  The Government will provide adequate wall space should the contractor not require floor/rack space.  The Government
   will provide electrical power and room environment for the installation of the Contractor equipment.  When additional rack space, floor
   space, or wall space is required to support Government requirements, the Contractor shall coordinate with the CSO.


3.1.  Local Commercial Communications Services.

   3.1.1.  Installation and Cutover.   The Contractor shall perform a site survey of the installation area after contract award.  The Contractor
   shall develop an installation and cutover plan for submittal to the Government no later than (NLT) 15 calendar days.  The Government requires
   15 working days to review and provide comments/acceptance.  The Contractor shall provide a final plan, NLT 10 working days, after receipt of
   the Government comments.  The Contractor shall not commence on-site installation and cutover until the Contractor receives Government
   acceptance of the service installation and cutover plan.  Installation of the initial required services for cutover of Local Commercial
   Communications Service requirements shall be as specified in the Appendix 10.  Installation, circuit assignments, all possible/applicable
   testing, records’ management, cutover and Government acceptance shall be completed NLT sixty (60) or ninety days (90) after contract award
   for AF Recruiters, one hundred and twenty (120) days after contract award for Air Force Guard Bases and smaller Air Force bases, and one
   hundred and eighty (180) days after contract award for larger Air Force Bases.  The Appendix 10 will identify the appropriate cutover and
   installation date requirements.  Deviations from the final Installation Plan will be coordinated with the Government prior to any work being
   accomplished in the affected area.  The contractor shall ensure that all circuits, equipment, and service provided by the incumbent, under
   the prior contract, are disconnected/discontinued/removed from site upon successful cutover.  In the event that the contract award is made to
   the incumbent Contractor, no installation/cutover plans will be required.  Any omissions or discrepancies in the installation and cutover
   plan does not relief the contractor’s responsibility to install, cutover and perform all services as identified in this requirement. It is
   the contractor’s responsibility to resolve any problems associated with these efforts.

         3.1.2.6.  Exchange Access Trunks.  The Contractor shall provide local exchange access service circuits for local trunks as specified in
         the Appendix 10.


         3.1.2.7.  Exchange Access Trunks Basic Service (BS).  BS of an exchange access trunk, as a minimum, shall include the following:


              a.  Call blocking for Numbering Plan Area (NPA) 900 direct inward dialing direct outward dialing two-way dialing channelization of
                 digital trunks (as specified by work order) trunk busy tones, DTMF, MF 2/6 and dial pulse (DP) address signaling, access,
                 services trunk and/or trunk group establishment, automatic trunk member selection (sequential, linear, most idle, etc.)
                 automatic trunk group alternate route selection Toll free access


              b.  Access to and selection of the members within the trunk group between two telephone switching systems must be coordinated to
                 provide optimum member selection and minimize glare conditions.  When two or more trunk groups are established to provide
                 services between the switching systems, the alternate route selection from one trunk group to the next provides users’ access to
                 these trunk groups in a coordinated and predetermined routing sequence.  The selection of members within a trunk group and the
                 alternate route selection of two or more trunk groups are included as basic functions of trunks and their access.


         3.1.2.8.  Off Premise Extension (OPX).  OPX is an acronym for Off Premise Extension. This is an extension telephone that terminates in
         a location distant from its parent base switch. OPX is generally used to provide authorized base personnel with access to the base
         switch.  The OPX will have features and functions as designated by the base switch and CSO.  The OPX can have direct access to the
         Defense Switched Network (DSN) or the FTS systems or both.  OPX services will not extend beyond the LATA or state line boundary.

         3.1.2.9.  Point-to-Point Circuits.  Refers to a connection restricted to two endpoints.  A traditional point-to-point circuit is a
         communications medium with exactly two endpoints. The host equipment at either end has to take full responsibility for formatting the
         data transmitted between the two end points. Point to Point circuits will not extend beyond the LATA or state line boundary.

         3.1.2.10.  Bit Rate Interface (BRI) Circuits.  BRI (128 - 256 - 384 ....512kb) and/or any circuit provisioning to include 1.54T-1 must
         meet the end equipment requirements for our base multi-functions to connect and operate at layer 1 and layer 2.  Most circuits
         provisioned today come in 2-wire-line BRI (128kb each) - usually utilized for local video support.  BRI traffic (as with any locally
         received commercial circuits) is sent out to our serviced customer on dry cable pair to the end-device.  Past practices from local
         Telco, we receive new circuit on d-mark located at the main central office frame (MDF) - from there our techs will x-connect out to our
         cable plant and wire customer jack to RJ-45, RJ-48C as applicable.

         3.1.2.11.  Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS).  The Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) is a
         White House-directed emergency phone service provided by the National Communications System (NCS) in the Cyber Security &
         Communications Division, National Protection and Programs of the Department of Homeland Security. GETS supports Federal, State, local,
         and tribal government, industry, and non-governmental organization (NGO) personnel in performing their National Security and Emergency
         Preparedness (NS/EP) missions. GETS provides emergency access and priority processing in the local and long distance segments of the
         Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). It is intended to be used in an emergency or crisis situation when the PSTN is congested and
         the probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means has significantly decreased. The servicing
         LEC must have NPA (710) in their switch to allow access to the GETS line assigned to a specific site.  Dialing 0/1+710-NXX-XXXX
         provides access to an emergency service for authorized users. The 710 NPA provides access to a tariffed service of the GETS
         interexchange carriers (AT&T, MCI WorldCom, and Sprint) and the call is billed to the U.S. Government.



         NOTE – The Government does not provide the contractor to allow any 10-10 dial around access on awarded contracts.

   3.1.3.  Transport Services.  The Contractor shall provide local exchange transport channel services as specified in the Appendix 10.  Local
   transport channel services include transport channel termination and transmission support, as applicable, for analog lines, ISDN lines, alarm
   circuits, data circuits up to 64 Kbps or aggregate N x 64 Kbps, High Capacity Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL), Digital Signal level 1 (DS-1),
   DS-3, OC-3, and may be expanded to OC-12, OC-24, OC-48, and higher bandwidth where applicable.


   3.1.4.  Circuit Termination.  Circuit termination at the Government installation includes the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) for analog
   signals, metallic cable pairs, Digital Signal Cross-Connect (DSX)-1 patch, cross connect panel for T-1 circuits, DSX-3 for electrical T-3
   circuits, fiber optic patch and cross connect panels for optical interface equipment such as the optical carrier or SONET systems, optical
   multiplexer equipment, and may extend to Cat 5/6 RJ-45 jack fields if directed by CSO to ensure adequate hand off of the circuit to the
   government.  Other wall-mounted, punch-down, terminal blocks are used for isolation and termination of Contractor metallic facilities.  The
   Contractor shall ensure that all circuits are clearly tagged in a permanent manner with the circuit identification number or telephone number
   assigned to the circuit, and the work order number.  The contractor shall be responsible to provide all equipment, facilities and wiring up
   to the government demarcation point as specified in the Appendix 10.

         3.1.4.1.  Analog and Low Data Rates.  The Contractor shall terminate the analog and lower rate data circuits to the Contractor-provided
         terminal blocks.  The Government shall provide frame space on the MDF for the installation of the Contractor provided protector
         vertical and horizontal blocks.  All outside plant copper cables entering the demarcation location must be electrically protected
         (grounded, terminated on protector modules, etc.).


         3.1.4.2.  High Data Rates.  The Contractor shall properly terminate digital circuits to the Contractor provided DSX-1, DSX-3, or fiber
         optic patch panel


         3.1.4.3   Circuit Testing.  The Contractor shall provide the test results to the CSO after a new circuit is tested, approved, and
         activated.  The notification shall be in a written or verbal format at the discretion of the CSO.  The parameters of the circuit
         characteristics shall be documented in the Customer Service Records.


   3.1.5.  Local Exchange Access and Service Areas.  The Contractor shall provide flat rate (FR) or measured rate services within local calling
   areas as identified in the Appendix 10.  FR services apply for both lines and trunks.  The local exchange access service areas shall, as a
   minimum, include the areas/zones coverage as currently defined by the incumbent local service provider(s) and/or the State PUC for the Site
   and shall be applied under the scope of this contract.  When the Contractor provides services to a Government installation, the LATA boundary
   shall not be limited or restricted to a Contractor’s service area.  Connection to intra-LATA exchange areas and with inter-LATA exchange
   carriers is required.  Access to the local exchange shall include Operator Assistance, Directory Assistance, and 911 services and functions.


   3.1.6.  Number Portability.  The Contractor shall provide number portability for commercial subscriber lines and local exchange direct-in-
   dial (DID) directory numbers.  The consistent use of the same prefix exchange and directory numbers provides the Government installation with
   its commercial identity.  The Government installation is also serviced by other Government switched networks (e.g., the Federal Telephone
   Service (FTS), and the Defense Switched Network (DSN)).  These networks provide DID trunks and are directly dependent on the mutually
   assigned DID number to terminate into stations on the installation.  Local exchange number portability and DID number growth is a critical
   factor in the ability of a Government installation to support its personnel and its missions.  The Contractor shall comply with the Federal
   Communications Commission (FCC), and the State Public Utility Commission (PUC) mandates for number portability.

3.2.   Demarcation.  The demarcation points shall be as specified in the Appendix 10.

   3.2.1.  Circuit Extension.  The Contractor shall provide circuit extension of a local communications service or circuit beyond the
   established base demarcation to a user designated termination point off base when required by the government.


   3.2.2.  Circuit Termination.  Circuit termination shall include termination hardware required to extend a circuit to a user location off base
   demarcation point.


   NOTE:  Government data networks and end equipment will not be available for contractor use.


   3.2.3.  Contractor Owned/Leased Transport Cable.  When Government cable is not available, the Contractor shall provide the circuit transport
   mileage by using the existing cable, either owned or leased from a third party. Mileage measurement will be based upon ¼ of one mile
   increments.


   3.2.4.  Contractor Equipment and Cable Installation.  The Contractor shall provide and install transmission equipment and cables for local
   exchange access and transport service circuits to the Government provided floor space at the base demarcation location(s).  The Contractor
   shall coordinate with the CSO for compliance with local procedures and requirements for equipment and cable installation.  The Contractor
   shall install equipment and cables in accordance with national and local safety codes.  The Contractor shall be responsible for wiring and
   connecting to Government provided power connection points, ground master connection points, and termination frames for terminal blocks.  The
   Contractor shall coordinate with the CSO for installation details. All new cable installations will be either underground or direct buried
   (i.e., NO aerial installations).  Replacement of existing cable may be either underground, direct buried or aerial at the discretion of the
   CSO.

3.3.  Restoration of Service and Maintenance.  The Contractor shall respond and restore service outages.  From the time of receipt of the
notification, the Contractor shall respond within the time limits as indicated below to discuss the outage issue. For mission-essential
functions, the CSO will identify and prioritize the essential contractor services.  The CSO will submit these services to the Telecommunications
Services Priority (TSP) and the base Restoration Priority List (RPL).  The Contractor will prioritize and perform restorations IAW the TSP &
RPL.  In the event that the Contractor anticipates not being able to perform any of the essential contractor services IAW the TSP & RPL during a
crisis situation, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or other designated representative as expeditiously as possible and use
its best efforts to cooperate with the Government in the Government’s efforts to maintain the continuity of operations.  For other non-mission
essential functions, if it is determined by the Contractor that the outage restoration time frames cannot be met, the Contractor will contact
the CSO.

The Contractor shall respond to the Government within one (1) hour of notification.

   3.3.1.  Catastrophic Outage.  The CSO can declare any outage as a catastrophic outage if the outage significantly affects the mission of the
   Government. A catastrophic outage is normally a sudden and widespread disaster stemming from the result of a man made or natural disaster in
   which property and site network infrastructure are completely destroyed.  Restore service time will be determined from the time the
   Contractor responds to the Government’s notification in accordance with the local TSP and RPL requirements. The contractor must advise the
   CSO of their restoration procedures for the base in a catastrophic situation.


   3.3.2.  Emergency Outage.  The CSO can declare any outage as an emergency outage if an outage significantly affects the mission of the
