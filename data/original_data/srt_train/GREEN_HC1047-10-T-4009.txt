Agency and Contracting Activity: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). Requiring Agency: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), DISA Information Systems Center (DISC) CI71A, P.O. Box 4502, Arlington, VA 22204-4502 Contracting Activity: Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization-National Capital Region (DITCO) NCR/PL6, 5111 Leesburg Pike, Skyline 5, Falls Church, VA 22041-3206 2. Nature/Description of Actions: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)). a. Type of Action: Firm Fixed-Price Contract b. Type of Funding: Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds c. Year of funding: FY10 d. Cisco components to perform Life-Cycle Upgrade of DISANet Infrastructure 3. Description of Supplies and Services: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)/DARS 6.303-2(a)(S-90)). The purpose of this effort is to acquire Cisco brand specific make and model components for a total of 181 line items to include: hardware and software (switches, connectors, power supply, and SMARTNET services). See attached equipment list for detailed product list included with this package. The detailed product list included with this package specifies the various locations CONUS and OCONUS requiring the delivery of the line items. Location listed below: 1.

5. PET DISA Northcom Field Office 250 South Peterson Blvd, Suite 215 Colorado Springs, CO 80914-3200 6. IHD DISA 3341 Strauss Ave. Indian Head, MD 20640-5036 Cisco brand specific make and model components are compatible with the existing operational and spare parts in accordance with the DISANet lifecycle management schedule. In addition, the new components to be integrated into the system interact with the existing Cisco components and can be upgraded individually to increase the functionality and performance of the platform. 4. Identification of Statutory Authority: : Authorized or Required by Statute, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5). (FAR 6.302-5/DFAR 206.302-5). The supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)). DISANet requires a standard enterprise wide configuration to ensure proper security certification and accreditation, as well as the highest level of reliability. It is critical that DISA maintain a standard configuration template to control compliancy, updates and security in the DISANet, which is deployed worldwide as an operational production environment. The DISANet mainly consists of Cisco infrastructure equipment, and includes more than 500 Cisco devices. The Cisco products channel the network traffic. Through sophisticated hardware, software and built-in technology, the Cisco appliances route, track, secure, and authenticate information to network addresses throughout the DoD. As the older Cisco products reach end-of-life they must be replaced with products that are fully compatible to the existing network. In order to achieve a complete integration, only those products that are fully compatible with the current manufacturers' protocols can be acquired. The Cisco products are currently being used within the production environment in over 30 DISANet sites world-wide. The products acquired through this action are upgraded components that will be installed in the existing Cisco device chassis. These components are only compatible with the existing chassis. Products or equipment for any other vendor simply can not be used to upgrade the existing platform. The Cisco products have been certified and accredited for use on the DISANet in accordance with existing security requirements. According to DoD Directive 8500.1, DISA provides security configuration guidance for Information Assurance (IA) and IA-enabled IT products through the issuance of Security Technical Information Guides (STIGs). DISA is the authoritative thought leader for DoD in areas of compliance and information assurance, therefore, the STIGs greatly increase the security of DoD networks. All IA or IA-enabled hardware, firmware, and software components of products incorporated into DoD information systems must comply with all security guidelines and regulations and remain in compliance throughout their connectivity.

6. FedBizOps/Potential Sources: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)). In accordance with FAR Part 5.201 (a) (6),
the solicitation and the brand name J&A will be posted on FedBizOpps.gov identifying the brand name specifications.

7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)). The Contracting Officer will procure all supplies and services from a responsible source. Based upon the market research competition is readily available and adequate information exists to determine responsibility and ensure fair and reasonable cost for the government.
8. Description of Market Research: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(8)). Market research was conducted by the DISANet Network IT Specialists who identfied published prices for Cisco products. Additional market research was conducted by requesting pricing information from Red River Computer Co. Inc., Force 3, Inc., World Wide Technology, Inc., Global Technology Resources Inc., Iron Bow Technologies and Cisco Systems Inc. Three out of five resellers (excluding Cisco System Inc.) supplied a complete pricing list for the required items. A determination was made that the Cisco products are commerically available and there is reasonable expectation that the Government will be able to obtain competitive prices. 9. Any Other Supporting Facts: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)). Cisco products have been previously purchased through fair opportunity competition among authorized resellers using various contract vehicles to include NASA SEWP and GWAC.

10. Listing of Interested Sources: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)). The following companies provided pricing for this effort. Force3, Inc 215 Pries Bridge Dr. Crofton, MD 21114 301-261-0204 Red River Computer Co., Inc. 85 Mechanic Street, Suite 400 Lebanon, NH 03766-1500 603-448-8880 Global Technology Resources Inc 990 S. Broadway STE 400 Denver, CO 80209 303-455-8808

11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)). The required products are proprietary to Cisco for the development and manufacturing of their hardware and software. Cisco however, authorizes the resale of these services to a number of authorized resellers. Accordingly to this extent, competition does exist for these services. No other action may be taken unless the existing hardware is replaced by another manufacture which is not a cost effective alternative for the protection and advancement of the Defense information System Agency mission critical system. Market research on products of this type are conducted on a regular basis to determine the availability of new technology offering the greatest protection at the most affordable and reasonable price with proven interoperability with the DISANet infrastructure. Until such time that other manufacture's products are determined identical or proven to provide greater capabilities, no further action can be taken, or will satisfy this requirement for the Government. 12. Reference to the Approved Acquisition Plan: (DARS 6.303-2(a)(S-91)) Not applicable for this action.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

HC1047-10-T-4009 Page 15 of 47 (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-ofname agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.
