Census Bureau IT Security Policies

April 2010

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The U.S. Census Bureau is strongly committed to Information Technology (IT) Security. Census Bureau senior leaders recognize that security must be inherent in our business processes and IT systems. Census Bureau managers systematically recognize and address information security risks and take steps to understand and manage these risks. This is important, not only to achieve compliance with public laws, federal regulations, and standards, but also to aid in the Census Bureau mission to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce of the United States. This document sets forth the Census Bureau IT Security Program Policies and is consistent with the Department of Commerce IT Security Program Policy (DOC ITSPP).

1.1

BACKGROUND

The Census Bureau's mission is to serve as the leading source of quality data about the Nation's people and economy. Because of the nature of this mission, protecting information and the systems that collect, process, and maintain that information is of critical importance. Therefore, securing information resources must include controls and safeguards to offset possible threats, as well as controls to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Provisions of the Privacy Act and United States Code Title 13 protect much of the data collected by the Census Bureau and make releasing sensitive data covered under these provisions a criminal act punishable by federal law. The Census Bureau strives to ensure that data confidentiality and integrity are consistent with statutory requirements and ethical considerations, while meeting the need for availability. Information security supports the Census Bureau mission by ensuring our information and systems are protected against risks of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access in accordance with applicable laws.

1.2

PURPOSE

The Census Bureau IT Security Program Policies specifies the mandatory requirements for the Census Bureau IT Security Program, which encompasses controls to be implemented on information and systems. This policy addresses requirements and guidance set forth by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) and provides clarity on the Department of Commerce and Census Bureau's specific parameters. It also encompasses minimum security controls as required by Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, and defined by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 3, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, commensurate with the security categorization defined by FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.

With the increasing complexities of missions and organizations, it is possible that a particular information system may involve multiple AOs. If so, agreements should be established among the AOs and documented in the SSP. In most cases, it will be advantageous to agree to a Lead AO to represent the interests of the other AOs. An AO can also delegate an Authorizing Official Designated Representative (AODR) to make mission risk determinations. However, the ultimate decision on the acceptability of such risk is the responsibility of the authorizing official. 3.3.6 Information System Owner (SO) The responsibility of the SO, as defined by NIST SP 800-37, is the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system. The SO is responsible for the development and maintenance of the SSP and ensures the system is deployed and operated according to the agreed-upon security requirements. The SO is also responsible for deciding who has access to the information system (and with what types of privileges or access rights) and ensures that system users and support personnel receive the requisite security training (e.g., instruction in RoB). The SO informs key agency officials of the need to conduct a security C&A of the information system, ensures that appropriate resources are available for the effort, and provides the necessary system-related documentation to the Certification Agent (CA). The SO receives the security assessment results from the CA. After taking appropriate steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities, the SO assembles the SAP and submits the package to the AO or the AODR for adjudication. 3.3.7 Information Owner (IO) The responsibilities of the IO are generally defined in NIST SP 800-37. The IO has statutory or operational authority for specified information and responsibility for establishing the controls for its generation, collection, processing, dissemination, and disposal.

3.3.9 Certification Agent (CA) The CA, as defined by NIST SP 800-37, is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting a security certification, or comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The CA also provides recommended corrective actions to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in the information system. Prior to initiating the security assessment activities that are a part of the certification process, the CA provides an independent assessment of the SSP to ensure the plan provides a set of security controls for the information system that is adequate to meet all applicable security requirements. 3.3.10 Information Security Manager The Information Security Manager serves as the principal security risk advisor, provides oversight functions, and coordinates and disseminates information security matters on behalf of a directorate. This role is often supported by appropriate coordinating roles (e.g., internet coordinators, Division Security Coordinators, property custodians, data custodians, ISSOs, which may be direct reports to the Information Security Manager. The Information Security Manager ensures that: (i) security risk-related considerations for individual information systems are viewed from a directorate-wide perspective with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of the directorate in carrying out its missions and business functions; and (ii) managing risk from individual information systems is consistent across the directorate, reflects organizational risk tolerance, and is considered along with other organizational risks in order to ensure mission or business success. The Information Security Manager also acts as the principal liaison with the SAISO to ensure that the directorate's security posture is compliant with applicable Federal laws as well as Departmental and Bureau policies. He/She will act as the principal person responsible for ensuring that information relating to information security is communicated throughout the directorate. 3.3.11 Division Security Coordinator (DSC) The Division Security Coordinator is responsible for coordinating division activities in support of meeting information security requirements and best practices. The Division Security Coordinator is a role that is focused on the coordination of security activities on behalf of a division, where as the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) is a role which is focused on an information system. The Division Security Coordinator assists the Information System Security Officer(s), as necessary, in support of Certification and Accreditation of Information Systems within the division (e.g., participate in risk assessments, development of Interagency Security Agreements, Memorandums of Understandings, Contingency Plans, Business Impact Assessments, etc.).

acquisitions. The HCOs and BPOs also play a critical role during the Development/Acquisition stage of system lifecycle management. The OUs consult with its BPO during the development of IT system security acquisitions. Development of acquisition requirements is integral to the lifecycle process. The BPO obtains the OU's requirements in the areas of technical features (e.g., access controls); personnel security (e.g., background checks for system developers); and operational practices (e.g., awareness and training) in the form of a statement of work prepared by the OU. After the OU has determined security features and requirements, and provided the Special Projects Office (SPO) with its Statement of Work, the SPO CO works with the Acquisition Team to ensure the solicitation, and later contract award, include the security requirements. The OU ITSOs/SAIAOs, SOs, COs, COTRs, and others involved in aspects of system security shall follow a methodology consistent with NIST SP 800-64, Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle. This methodology ensures that IT security is addressed in the acquisition process. The DOC requires that acquisition professionals (e.g., COs and Contract Specialists) provide a valuable service by ensuring that their customers work with OUs, including ITSOs, to address security in their IT contract requirements in all stages of an acquisition (i.e., from the earliest budgeting and acquisition planning stages through requirements development, solicitation, source evaluation and selection, contract award and administration). The CAM, Section 1337.70, Security Processing Requirements for On-Site Security Requirements requires the customer to work with their respective security office before a solicitation is released to designate contract risk levels (for all on-site contracts, not just IT) and then after award to arrange for background investigations on contractor employees in accordance with DOC Manual of Security Policies and Procedures, Chapter 11. The OU shall provide the BPO with the appropriate risk determination for the contract, and the BPO includes the corresponding appropriate language in the contract. 3.7.5 Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM) The OHRM maintains the memorandum of agreement between the National Finance Center (NFC) and DOC. The MOU is for the NFC to provide services for maintaining the NFC database with DOC employee information. This database may be utilized for maintaining a credentials management system and authorization of individual employee physical access controls at the OU. The NFC database manages personnel information used to perform background checks and other investigative information. In addition, the NFC database may be used to document the status of personnel access to information resources (e.g., employment status). The NFC database is a resource used in conjunction with OSY resources to maintain the status of physical access credentials such as building passes and badges for employees and contractors. This database consists of Privacy Act (PA) information which must be maintained consistent with PA requirements and can only be disclosed pursuant to disclosure provisions of the PA.

4.0 IT SECURITY POLICY CONTROLS
The following sections describe the security controls required for low, moderate, and high-baseline information systems, as defined by NIST 800-53, Revision 3 and the Census Bureau ITSO. The requirements documented herein represent the minimum security requirements for each security baseline; additionally, System Owners may, at their discretion, elect to include additional controls documented below, including non-selected security controls (those not required for any systems). If non-selected controls are included in an information system baseline, it is the responsibility of the System Owner to define any control assignments and selections in the information system security plan.

4.1

ACCESS CONTROL

Class: Technical Logical access controls are the system-based mechanisms used to designate who or what is to have access to a specific system resource and the type of transactions and functions that are permitted. They include controls that: Restrict users to authorized transactions and functions, and Limit network access and public access to the system.
Control Number Control Name/Requirement Security Baselines Low Moderate High

Access Control Policy and Procedures The Census Bureau IT Security Program Policies document represents the formal documented Census Bureau information security policies and addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, and compliance as they pertain to information security. Enterprise-level procedural documentation has been developed by ITSO to provide general guidelines for control implementation. The policy and procedures must be reviewed, updated and disseminated at least every other year.

"Inactivity" is defined as only those actions which would require interaction of a user (i.e., system and application calls are not included) Currently, the NIST Special Publication 800-53 Rev. 3 does not mandate implementation of this control for low, moderate, or high baseline systems. Therefore, the Census Bureau will not assess any systems according to this control. Program Offices/System Owners may elect to require that information systems implement a session lock mechanism that, when activated on a device with a display screen, places a publicly viewable pattern onto the associated display, hiding what was previously visible on the screen.

IT SECURITY AWARENESS AND TRAINING

Class: Operational A strong IT security program cannot be put in place without significant attention given to training agency IT users on security policy, procedures, and techniques, as well as the various management, operational, and technical controls necessary and available to secure IT resources. In addition, those in the agency who manage the IT infrastructure need to have the necessary skills to carry out their assigned duties effectively. Failure to give attention to the area of security training puts an enterprise at great risk because security of agency resources is as much a human issue as it is a technology issue.1

AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Class: Technical Audit trails maintain a record of system activity by system or application processes and by user activity and processes. In conjunction with appropriate tools and procedures, audit trails can provide individual accountability, a means to reconstruct events, detect intrusions, and identify problems. System audit trails, or event logs, provide a record of events in support of activities to monitor and enforce the IT system security policy. The NIST SP 800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook, Chapter 18, describes an event as any action that happens on a computer system, such as logging into a system, executing a program, and opening a file. All audit logs are subject to recording and routine review by the Census Bureau ITSO and auditors for inappropriate or illegal activity. System owners must ensure the protection of system event logs with filelevel permissions, separation of duties, and all other safeguards commensurate with the highest level of sensitivity of the information residing on the system for which the logs record data.

CERTIFICATION, ACCREDITATION, AND SECURITY ASSESSMENTS

Class: Management C&A is the process of formal assessment, testing (certification), and acceptance (accreditation) of system security controls that protect IT systems and data stored in and processed by those systems. This process recognizes, evaluates, and assigns responsibility for the risk of operating an IT system, encompasses the system's life cycle, and ensures that the risk of operating a system is recognized, evaluated, and accepted. The C&A process implements the concept of "adequate security," or security commensurate with risk, including the magnitude of harm resulting from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information, which is defined in OMB Circular A-130. Although C&A are related, they are separate procedures and have different objectives. Certification is a short-term activity that is repeated after any significant system-related change is completed and is a prerequisite for accreditation. Accreditation is a long-term authorization, up to three years, that allows a system to operate based on the facts, plans, and schedules developed during certification. In the C&A process, there is an evaluation of the tests performed on security controls to determine (i) whether the residual risk to the system (risk not eliminated by implementation of counter measures) is acceptable; and (ii) whether the functioning controls provide adequate protection for the system to operate.

IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

Class: Technical Identification and authentication is a technical measure that prevents unauthorized people (or unauthorized processes) from entering an IT system. Access control usually requires that the system be able to identify and differentiate users. All Census Bureau IT systems must have a means to enforce user accountability when using Census Bureau IT systems, so that system activity (both authorized and unauthorized) can be traced to specific users. To ensure user accountability, the Census Bureau requires that all IT systems implement a method of user identification and authentication. The user identification tells the system who the users are; the authentication mechanism provides an added level of assurance that the users really are who they say they are. Authentication consists of something a user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a token or smart card), or something the user is (such as a fingerprint). User identification and authentication also can enforce separation of duties.

Identification and Authentication Policy and Procedures The Census Bureau IT Security Program Policies document represents the formal documented Census Bureau information security policies, and addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, and compliance as they pertain to information security. Enterprise-level procedural documentation has been developed by ITSO to provide general guidelines for control implementation. The policy and procedures must be reviewed, updated and disseminated at least every other year. Program Offices/System Owners must ensure information systems uniquely identify and authenticate users (or processes acting on behalf of users). User identification and authentication provides for accountability of user system activities and enforce separation of duties by limiting access. Multifactor authentication must be employed for network access to privileged accounts. Network access is defined as access to a system component (server, network device, application, or database) from a terminal that is physically separated from the system component. Multifactor authentication must be employed for network access to nonprivileged accounts. Network access is defined as access to a system component (server, application, etc) from a terminal that is physically separated from the component in question. Multifactor authentication must be employed for local access to privileged accounts. Local access is defined as access to a system component (server, application, etc) from a terminal that hosts the component in question. Multifactor authentication must be employed for local access to nonprivileged accounts.

4.12 IT SECURITY PLANNING
Class: Management IT security planning is an important quality control tool for the Census Bureau that helps improve the protection level of IT assets. All federal systems have some level of sensitivity and require protection as part of good management practices. The IT security planning process encompasses the following components: Documentation of management, technical, and operational controls in a system's security plan System C&A Security training, awareness, and education. When a management official within the Census Bureau authorizes system operation, the manager accepts the associated risk due to information loss, system misuse, unauthorized system access or modification, system unavailability, and/or undetected system activities. Good security planning, therefore, serves an important risk management function by providing the necessary information to determine the type and level of risks, and to base decisions on risk acceptance or mitigation. Managers must also be assured that all personnel accessing the system, from those performing system management functions to general users, have received security training at levels commensurate with the duties they perform.

4.14 RISK ASSESSMENT
Class: Management As mandated by the DOC, the Census Bureau must have a risk management process in place that follows the methodology and reporting format defined in NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems. Risk management is the ongoing process of managing risks to Census Bureau operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals resulting from operating an information system (general support system (GSS) or major application (MA)). It includes assessing risk; selecting, implementing, and assessing cost-effective security controls; and formally authorizing system operation. The process considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to laws, directives, policies, or regulations. Proper risk management requires steps to be taken to reduce the risk level to an acceptable level. A team led by the system owner and other interested parties first performs a risk assessment for all new systems and systems undergoing major modification. A risk assessment is the methodical identification of (i) threats to a system or information processed or stored by the system, (ii) vulnerability of the system to threats, (iii) probability, or risk, a given threat could exploit the vulnerabilities, and (iv) the effectiveness of current or proposed safeguards/controls. The risk assessment team identifies the controls in place and additional controls needed to provide adequate security for the system and reduces the risk level to one acceptable to the system owner. The system owner then performs periodic vulnerability testing of the controls to monitor the continued adequacy of system security.

DOC Criteria DOC deems the following types of information as "non -sensitive": Publicly available information; Non-publicly available information that is derived from publicly available information or that is destined for public dissemination; and, Other information that may not currently be publicly available but that is generally suited for public dissemination (i.e., information whose disclosure would have limited or no adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals). The term "sensitive" not only refers to unclassified private data or proprietary information, but to highly classified national security government information as well. "Sensitive" information includes any information protected from disclosure by any statute, including the FOIA. DOC Criteria PII refers to information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, Social Security Number (SSN), biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, etc. DOC Criteria The Department requires that SOs follow the methodology defined in NIST SP 800-59, Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System, to determine whether a system requires additional protections due to national security impacts. o Reference o

4.16 SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION
Class: Technical The System and Communications Protection control family describes the technical mechanisms that the enterprise can employ to provide a baseline defense against basic system and communication attack methods. The majority of the control mechanisms are designed to be implemented at the server and network tier of the enterprise computing environment; however, selected controls may apply to enterprise applications as well. Common themes, including segmenting computing resources and applying data encryption characterize the system and communications protection control family.

Appendix B. GLOSSARY
Term Access Control Definition The process of limiting access to the resources of a system only to authorized programs, processes, or other systems (in a network). Synonymous with controlled access and limited access. The official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals, based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. All components of an information system to be accredited by an Authorizing Official (AO) and excludes separately accredited systems, to which the information system is connected. Synonymous with the term security perimeter defined in CNSS Instruction 4009 and DCID 6/3. The evidence provided to the AO to be used in the security accreditation decision process. Evidence includes, but is not limited to: (i) the System Security Plan; (ii) the assessment results from the security certification; and (iii) the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms). The independent examination of records and activities to ensure compliance; establish controls, policy, and operational procedures, and to recommend indicated changes in controls, policy, or procedures. A chronological record of system activities that is sufficient to enable the reconstruction, reviewing, and examination of the sequence of environments and activities surrounding or leading to an operation, a procedure, or an event in a transaction from its inception. The authentication mechanism provides an added level of assurance that the user really is who he/she says he/she is. Authentication consists of something a user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a token or smart card), or something the user is (such as a fingerprint). It is the process by which the remote user is identified by entering a valid username and password. The AO (or approving/accrediting authority) must be a senior DOC program official or other DOC executive with the authority to take formal responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. An optional role, the AODR is a DOC management employee acting on the AO's behalf in coordinating and carrying out accreditation-related activities required during the security accreditation of an information system. The designated representative interacts with the System Owner (SO), Information System Security Officer, Certification Agent (CA), and other interested parties, and may be empowered by the AO to make decisions with regard to the planning of the C&A activities, including identification of resources necessary to carry out the C&A activities. The granting of access rights to a user, program, or process. The concept that users will be able to access data when needed. A comprehensive assessment of the management, operational and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of security accreditation, to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. 158 For Official Use Only

April 2010 Definition Also, referred to within DOC as the System Certifier, the CA is an individual, group, or organization responsible for conducting a security certification. The concept of holding sensitive data in confidence, limited to an appropriate set of individuals or organizations. The management of security features and assurances through control of changes made to a system's hardware, software, firmware, documentation, test, test fixtures, and test documentation throughout the development and operational life of the system. A plan for emergency response, back-up operations, and post-disaster recovery maintained by an activity as a part of its security program that will ensure the availability of critical resources and facilitate the continuity of operations in an emergency situation. Synonymous with Emergency Plan, Business Resumption Plan (BRP), and Business Continuity Plan (BCP). An arrangement wherein a third party is contracted by DOC to: 1. Provide IT services and systems on behalf of Commerce at contractor facilities, 2. Provide IT services and systems to Commerce via remote access, and 3. Develop or maintain Commerce IT systems or software. An attack that prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or applications by exhausting resources. For example: An attacker sends specially crafted packets to a Web server, causing it to crash. An attacker directs hundreds of external compromised workstations to send as many Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) requests as possible to the organization's network. DOC-owned/furnished resources is government equipment including computers, other hardware devices, software, and data that are owned by the DOC and are provided to remote users for use in their official duties. A firewall is a general term for a network perimeter or border router device (may be hardware, software, or both) designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from one networked environment to another networked environment. A computing environment may consist of one or more firewall devices that each protects specific segments of the internal DOC networked environment. The outermost of these devices would face the public Internet. Firewalls can be configured to examine all messages entering or leaving a DOC network and block those messages that are not explicitly allowed by the firewall configuration rules. Forensic examination is the detailed inspection of computer memory and storage media to confirm or deny the occurrence of compromised information and applications, and if compromised, the extent to which information was compromised. A General Support System (GSS) is interconnected information resources under the same direct management control which share common functionality. A GSS normally includes hardware, software, information, data, applications, communications, facilities, and people and provides support for a variety of users and applications.

April 2010 Definition Occurs when a person violates acceptable computing use policies. For example: A user provides illegal copies of software to others through Peer-to-Peer file sharing services. A person threatens another person through e-mail. The ability to associate positively the identity of a user with the time, method, and degree of access to a system. Information sensitivity reflects the relationship between the characteristics of the information processed (e.g., personnel data subject to protection under the Privacy Act) and the mission need to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information (e.g., legal requirements to protect confidentiality of personal data). Sensitivity may vary from Low, to Moderate, to High. During the system risk assessment, the SO must determine the sensitivity, or reaction, of the agency's mission to compromises of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information stored and processed by the system. This determination, along with the likelihood of compromise occurring, establishes the level of security adequate to protect the data as required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III. The SO must identify the management, technical, and operational controls necessary to provide the required protection, and properly mark media containing sensitive information. The concept that data, when viewed, will be in sound, unimpaired, or perfect condition. IT resources consist of computer hardware, software, firmware, electronic data, networks, and support for these assets. A discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Computer network that spans a relatively small area, such as a single building or group of buildings. A system that requires special attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the system. Note: All Federal systems require some level of protection. Certain systems, because of the information in them, however, require special management oversight and should be treated as major. Adequate security for other systems should be provided by security of the systems in which they operate. A virus, worm, Trojan Horse, or other code-based malicious entity that infects a host. For example: A worm uses open file shares to quickly infect several hundred workstations within an organization. An organization receives a warning from an anti-virus vendor that a new virus is spreading rapidly via e-mail throughout the Internet. The virus takes advantage of a vulnerability that is present in many of the organization's hosts. Based on previous anti-virus incidents, the organization expects that the new virus will infect some of its hosts within the next three (3) hours. The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an information system that focus on the management of risk and the management of information system security.

The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an information system that primarily are implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). They consist of: personnel security; physical and environmental protection; contingency planning; configuration management; maintenance; system and information integrity; media protection; incident response; and awareness and training. A protected/private character string used to authenticate an identity. The act of successfully bypassing the security mechanisms of a system. Computers, other hardware devices, and software, owned by the remote access user. The application of physical barriers and control procedures as preventive measures or countermeasures against threats to resources and sensitive information. Computers and other hardware devices owned by a party other than the DOC or the remote user, to which the unrestricted access by the general public is allowed. Access by users (or information systems) communicating external to an information system security perimeter. Remote access uses telecommunications to enable authorized access to non-public DOC computing services that would otherwise be inaccessible from work locations outside a DOC LAN or DOCcontrolled WAN computing environment. This includes access to non-public DOC IT systems and data that are exposed to the public Internet (e.g., Web access to electronic mail by the home user or business traveler) as well as modem dial-up and/or Virtual Private Network (VPN) access to internal DOC IT servers and desktop workstations. A remote location is a work location at which the worker is not able to connect his/her computer directly to a DOC-controlled LAN or DOC-controlled WAN that contains the systems needed for official duties. This includes a worker's home, a traveler's hotel room, or an emergency worker's field location. Work from remote locations requires the use of telecommunications capabilities such as dial-up modems, Internet connectivity, or wireless networks to access DOC IT systems and data for official duty purposes. Any user who requires access to DOC IT systems from a remote location. Users may include DOC federal employees and contractors, employees of other federal agencies who require remote access to DOC systems, and remote researchers processing DOC information. 161 For Official Use Only

Census Bureau IT Security Policies Term Residual Risk Risk

April 2010 Definition The remaining risk not eliminated by implementation of security controls or countermeasures. The probability that a particular threat will exploit a particular vulnerability of the system. The process of identifying risks to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals by determining the probability of occurrence, the resulting impact, and additional security controls that would mitigate this impact. Part of risk management, synonymous with risk analysis, and incorporates threat and vulnerability analyses. The process of managing risks to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, or individuals results from the operation of an information system. It includes risk assessment; cost-benefit analysis; the selection, implementation, and assessment of security controls; and the formal authorization to operate the system. The process considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to laws, directives, policies, or regulations. Process to remove information from media such that information recovery is not possible. It includes removing all labels, markings, and activity logs. An evaluation done to assess the degree of trust that can be placed in systems for the secure handling of sensitive information. One type, a product evaluation, is an evaluation performed on the hardware and software features and assurances of a computer product from a perspective that excludes the system environment. The other type, a system evaluation, is done for the purpose of assessing a system's security safeguards with respect to a specific operational mission and is a major step in the certification and accreditation (C&A) process. The security-relevant functions, mechanisms, and characteristics of system hardware and software. Security features are a subset of system security safeguards. The set of laws, rules, and practices that regulate how an organization manages, protects, and distributes sensitive information. The types and levels of protection necessary for equipment, data, information, software applications, and facilities to meet security policy. The protective measures and controls that are prescribed to meet the security requirements specified for a system. Those safeguards may include, but are not necessarily limited to: hardware and software security features, operating procedures, accountability procedures, access and distribution controls, management constraints, personnel security, and physical structures, areas, and devices. Also called safeguards. ST&E is the process used to examine the effectiveness of IT system controls with the objective of determining the true risk, or exposure, of the system to certain threats. Through the conduct of control tests, the ITSO and SO identify vulnerabilities that result from improper use of controls, missing controls, inherent system vulnerabilities, or mismanagement. Through the application of ST&E methods, the CA analyzes the current state of the system by reviewing the system objects, and searching for anomalies that might indicate vulnerabilities that could permit an attack. ST&E results in development of a POA&Ms to track corrective actions necessary to mitigate vulnerabilities and reduce risk. 162 For Official Use Only

Any information of which the loss, misuse, modification, or unauthorized access could affect the national interest or the conduct of federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Section 552a of Title 5, U.S. Code, but that has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an EO or an act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. A significant change is one that alters the baseline system configuration through the addition, deletion, or change of a configuration item within the system. Examples of significant changes to an information system that should be reviewed for possible re-accreditation include but are not limited to: (i) installation of a new or upgraded operating system, middleware component, or application; (ii) modifications to system ports, protocols, or services; (iii) installation of a new or upgraded hardware platform or firmware component; or (iv) modifications to cryptographic modules or services. Changes in laws, directives, policies, or regulations, while not always directly related to the information system, can also potentially affect the security of the system and trigger a re-accreditation action.

Mid-level manager responsible for day-to-day system operations and responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, or operation and maintenance of an information system. The security controls (i.e., safeguards or countermeasures) for an information system that are primarily implemented and executed by the information system through mechanisms contained in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system. They consist of: identification and authentication; access control; audit and accountability; and system and communications protection. Any circumstance or event with the potential to cause harm to a system in the form of destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or DoS.

April 2010 Definition A virtual private network is a private "tunnel" through a public network (i.e., the Internet). A virtual private network is a logical network that is established, at the application layer of the OSI model, over an existing physical network and typically does not include every node present on the physical network. Authorized users are granted access to the logical network. For example, there are a number of systems that enable you to create networks using the Internet as the medium for transporting data. These systems use encryption and other security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the network and that the data cannot be intercepted. A WAN is a system of LANs connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves. A WLAN consists of a network that uses radio waves rather than wires to communicate between nodes.

(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-- (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. (g) Contract award. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. The Government anticipates issuing the resultant award on or about July 27, 2012. Award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to the RFP, provides the overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors and price considered. The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the program goals at a fair and reasonable price. Once a determination has been made that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with this procurement, a contract will be placed with the successful Offeror. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Offeror's Price Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.
