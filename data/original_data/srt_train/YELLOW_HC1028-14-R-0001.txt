8.  Place of Performance.

Place of performance is dependent upon the task to be performed.  With the exception of tasks associated with FaCIT, daily work will be
performed within government facilities at Scott AFB.  Place of performance for FaCIT personnel is in government facilities at Maxwell AFB-Gunter
Annex, AL.  Temporary working locations resulting from required travel may be at other locations inside and outside the Continental United
States (CONUS).  (Refer to paragraph 6.8  Task 8 - Travel.)  Contractors may be sited at a Contractor facility in the event sufficient on-base
office space is not available.  When mission requirements dictate, the Contractor shall perform long distance travel trips to other installation
sites to planning meetings and conferences in support of LHC.  When mission requirements dictate, the Contractor shall perform local travel to
sites for planning meetings and conferences in support of LHC.  Travel may be local (defined as within 50 miles of the usual Contractor
personnel work site [see paragraph 8, Place of Performance]) or long distance, including international.  Local travel costs shall not be at the
expense of the Government.  All travel must be authorized by only the PM, COR or Alternate COR in advance of the travel.  Contractor personnel
shall respect and follow DoD, Air Force, Base, and local facility regulations, policy, and official directions on facility use, including such
examples as personal equipment and tobacco use, whether at permanent or temporary work sites.

Alternate Place of Performance - Contingency Only (when personnel work on-site at a government facility).  Contractor employees may be required
to work at home, another approved activity within the local travel area or at the Contractor's facility in cases of unforeseen conditions or
contingencies (e.g., pandemic conditions, exercises, etc.).  Any equipment such as laptops or phones provided to Contractor personnel shall be
returned at the termination of the engagement or at another time mutually agreeable to both parties.  Contracting Officer Representative (COR)
approval is required.  Contractor shall prepare all deliverables and other contract documentation utilizing Contractor resources.  To the extent
possible, the Contractor shall use best efforts to provide the level of support as stated in the SOW.  In the event the services are impacted,
reduced, compromised, etc., the Contracting Officer or the Contractor may request an equitable adjustment.

Other than the above Contingency condition, no telework shall be authorized for contractor team members.

9.  Period of Performance.

Initial contract period: April 1, 2014 — March 31, 2015
Optional contract period 1: April 1, 2015— March 31, 2016
Optional contract period 2: April 1, 2016— March 31, 2017
Optional contract period 3: April 1, 2017 — March 31, 2018
Optional contract period 4: April 1, 2018 — March 31, 2019

CMO functions will include expanded support hours for coverage based upon time zones.  Duty Hours are 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. CST, Monday through
 Friday, excluding USAFE and PACAF core hours, and after duty hour scheduled system maintenance downtime and the following Federal holidays:

      New Year’s Day
      Martin Luther King’s Birthday
      Presidents Day
      Memorial Day
      Independence Day
      Labor Day
      Columbus Day
      Veterans Day
      Thanksgiving Day
      Christmas Day

When the holiday falls on a Saturday the day is observed on the Friday before; when the holiday falls on a Sunday the day is observed on the
Monday after. With respect to Military Down, Training Days, Family Days, or Alternate Duty sites, this is a normal workday and all Contractor
employees are required to be at their normal place of duty.  In the event that the unit commander or any subordinate manager permits early
release for Government personnel, Contractor personnel are not relieved from a normal workday.  For the CMO, the Contractor must arrange
coverage during their respective support duty hours to provide a continuous presence during duty hours.  USAFE and PACAF CMO personnel core
hours are the same as those for the Central time zone, but adjusted to the equivalent for their respective time zones.

As directed by the COR, the contractor shall continue performance in emergency, exercise, or mission essential conditions, insofar as this is
compliant with directives issued by the Base Commander and direction of the Contracting Officer.  Additionally, the contractor may be required
to account for the whereabouts of their personnel should this information be requested by COR.  With appropriate notice to contractor
management, personnel may be required to support short-notice temporary adjustments to the daily work hours.

11.  Security.

11.1 Classification level of the work.
The work of this contract involves UNCLASSIFIED, SECRET, and in limited roles, TOP SECRET data.  All contractor personnel will hold a minimum of
a SECRET clearance.  The background of the Contractor personnel shall be of such a nature that a TOP SECRET clearance can be obtained if
required.  The Network Administrator or System Administrator roles require TOP SECRET clearance be held.  Routine access to classified data and
systems may be required.  Some systems to be accessed may require entrance into a restricted facility; appropriate clearances are required.

11.2 Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).
Nondisclosure agreements are required of all personnel for permitting access to AF networks.  Additional NDAs may be requested in limited
circumstances.

11.3 Information Assurance (IA) Certification (“8570 Certification”).
Some tasks under this contract require Information Assurance certifications in accordance with Department of Defense 8570.01-M (with changes),
Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, Air Force guidance,  and DFAR 252.239-7001 Information Assurance Contractor Training and
Certification, specifically paragraph (c) “Contractor personnel who do not have proper and current certification shall be denied access to DoD
information  systems for the purpose of performing information assurance functions”.  In compliance with AFMAN 33-285 Information Assurance (IA)
Workforce Improvement Program (17 June 2011) guidance for required certifications when performing certain tasks has been added above at the
description of those tasks.  All personnel brought onto this contract shall possess certification appropriate to the tasks to perform, and shall
maintain those certifications while on this contract.  Contractor personnel shifting from a position not requiring IA certification to one
requiring such certification, or to a position requiring higher certification, shall possess the certification prior to assuming the new
position.  Refer to the DISA web site “DoD 8570 Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program” (http://iase.disa.mil/eta/iawp/) for a
summary of DoD requirements and baseline certifications.  No certification will be obtained at Government expense to this contract.

12.  Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government-Furnished Information (GFI).

12.1  For those personnel working in Government facilities, the Government shall provide an office environment similar to that for Government
personnel, to include computers, appropriate peripherals, software, printer access, network connectivity, and telephones.  Programming teams
will have access to testing and development software and servers.  Access by Contractor personnel is for performance of official contract
duties: personal use shall be limited to that permitted by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as well as DoD, Air Force and local policy.

13.  Other Pertinent Information or Special Considerations.  No oral statement of any person shall modify or otherwise affect the terms,
conditions, or specifications stated in this contract.  All modifications to the contract must be made in writing by the Contracting Officer or
an authorized representative.

      a.  Identification of Possible Follow-on Work.  Potential Growth.  Dependent on changing requirements and available funding, the
Government may request an increase in the level of effort through contract mod which may be issued at any time during the contract year.  The
contract contains priced options which may or may not be invoked.

      b.  Identification of Potential Conflicts of Interest (COI).  Any situation that may influence which contractor should be awarded the
contract/TO.  FAR Part 9.501 defines “organizational COI” as a situation where because of other relationships or activities a person (company)
is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government or cannot objectively perform contract work or has an
unfair competitive advantage.  FAR 9.502 states that “an organization COI may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of
interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential COI on a
future acquisition.”  An “organizational COI” exists when the nature of the work to be performed may, without some restriction on future
activities, (1) result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor on other contracts or (2) impair the contractor’s objectivity in
performing the contract work.  The primary burden is on the contractor to identify any organizational COI, however, the Government has the
responsibility to identify and evaluate such conflicts.  The KO is charged with avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating such potential conflicts.
The customer must make a determination that no COI exist, or identify any potential COI that may exist for the execution of this contract/TO.

      c.  Identification of Non-Disclosure Requirements.  The contractor, in the performance of this contract, may receive or have access to
certain sensitive information, including information provided on a proprietary basis by other contractors.  The contractor agrees to sign non-
disclosure statements as required, and agrees to use and examine this information exclusively in the performance of this contract and to take
the necessary steps in accordance with Government regulations to prevent disclosure of such information to any party outside the Government.
“Sensitive information” means the type of information that would be exempted from disclosure by Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), i.e., “trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is considered privileged or confidential.”  Therefore, any information
that could not be disclosed under FOIA should be considered subject to non-disclosure, and not divulged except as necessary to perform the
contract.  A contractor employee should exercise good faith and reasonable judgment in deciding whether information regarding other contractors
is to be considered privileged or confidential.  When in doubt, such information should be considered privileged and confidential, and not
disclosed, except as required to perform the contracts.

      d.  Packaging, Packing and Shipping Instructions.  None.

      e.  Inspection and Acceptance Criteria.  None.

      f.  Property Accountability.

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.203-16  Preventing Personal Conflicts of Interest (DEC 2011)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Acquisition function closely associated with inherently governmental functions means supporting or providing advice or recommendations with
regard to the following activities of a Federal agency:

(1) Planning acquisitions.

(2) Determining what supplies or services are to be acquired by the Government, including developing statements of work.

(3) Developing or approving any contractual documents, to include documents defining requirements, incentive plans, and evaluation criteria.

(4) Evaluating contract proposals.

(5) Awarding Government contracts.

(6) Administering contracts (including ordering changes or giving technical direction in contract performance or contract quantities, evaluating
contractor performance, and accepting or rejecting contractor products or services).

(7) Terminating contracts.

(8) Determining whether contract costs are reasonable, allocable, and allowable.

Covered employee means an individual who performs an acquisition function closely associated with inherently governmental functions and is--

(1) An employee of the contractor; or

(2) A subcontractor that is a self-employed individual treated as a covered employee of the contractor because there is no employer to whom such
an individual could submit the required disclosures.

Non-public information means any Government or third-party information that--

(1) Is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or otherwise protected from disclosure by statute, Executive
order, or regulation; or

(2) Has not been disseminated to the general public and the Government has not yet determined whether the information can or will be made
available to the public.

Personal conflict of interest means a situation in which a covered employee has a financial interest, personal activity, or relationship that
could impair the employee's ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the Government when performing under the contract. (A de
minimis interest that would not ``impair the employee's ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the Government'' is not covered
under this definition.)

(1) Among the sources of personal conflicts of interest are--

(i) Financial interests of the covered employee, of close family members, or of other members of the covered employee's household;

(ii) Other employment or financial relationships (including seeking or negotiating for prospective employment or business); and

(iii) Gifts, including travel.

(2) For example, financial interests referred to in paragraph (1) of this definition may arise from--

(i) Compensation, including wages, salaries, commissions, professional fees, or fees for business referrals;

(ii) Consulting relationships (including commercial and professional consulting and service arrangements, scientific and technical advisory
board memberships, or serving as an expert witness in litigation);

(iii) Services provided in exchange for honorariums or travel expense reimbursements;

(iv) Research funding or other forms of research support;

(v) Investment in the form of stock or bond ownership or partnership interest (excluding diversified mutual fund investments);

(vi) Real estate investments;

(vii) Patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property interests; or

(viii) Business ownership and investment interests.

(b) Requirements. The Contractor shall--

(1) Have procedures in place to screen covered employees for potential personal conflicts of interest, by--

(i) Obtaining and maintaining from each covered employee, when the employee is initially assigned to the task under the contract, a disclosure
of interests that might be affected by the task to which the employee has been assigned, as follows:

(A) Financial interests of the covered employee, of close family members, or of other members of the covered employee's household.

(B) Other employment or financial relationships of the covered employee (including seeking or negotiating for prospective employment or
business).

(C) Gifts, including travel; and

(ii) Requiring each covered employee to update the disclosure statement whenever the employee's personal or financial circumstances change in
such a way that a new personal conflict of interest might occur because of the task the covered employee is performing.

(2) For each covered employee--

(i) Prevent personal conflicts of interest, including not assigning or allowing a covered employee to perform any task under the contract for
which the Contractor has identified a personal conflict of interest for the employee that the Contractor or employee cannot satisfactorily
prevent or mitigate in consultation with the contracting agency;

(ii) Prohibit use of non-public information accessed through performance of a Government contract for personal gain; and

(iii) Obtain a signed non-disclosure agreement to prohibit disclosure of non-public information accessed through performance of a Government
contract.

(3) Inform covered employees of their obligation--

(i) To disclose and prevent personal conflicts of interest;

(ii) Not to use non-public information accessed through performance of a Government contract for personal gain; and

(iii) To avoid even the appearance of personal conflicts of interest;

(4) Maintain effective oversight to verify compliance with personal conflict-of-interest safeguards;

(5) Take appropriate disciplinary action in the case of covered employees who fail to comply with policies established pursuant to this clause;
and

(6) Report to the Contracting Officer any personal conflict-of-interest violation by a covered employee as soon as it is identified. This report
shall include a description of the violation and the proposed actions to be taken by the Contractor in response to the violation. Provide follow-
up reports of corrective actions taken, as necessary. Personal conflict-of-interest violations include--

(i) Failure by a covered employee to disclose a personal conflict of interest;

(ii) Use by a covered employee of non-public information accessed through performance of a Government contract for personal
gain; and

(iii) Failure of a covered employee to comply with the terms of a non-disclosure agreement.

(c) Mitigation or waiver. (1) In exceptional circumstances, if the Contractor cannot satisfactorily prevent a personal conflict of interest as
required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this clause, the Contractor may submit a request through the Contracting Officer to the Head of the
Contracting Activity for--

(i) Agreement to a plan to mitigate the personal conflict of interest; or

(ii) A waiver of the requirement.

(2) The Contractor shall include in the request any proposed mitigation of the personal conflict of interest.

(3) The Contractor shall--

(i) Comply, and require compliance by the covered employee, with any conditions imposed by the Government as necessary to mitigate the personal
conflict of interest; or

(ii) Remove the Contractor employee or subcontractor employee from performance of the contract or terminate the applicable subcontract.

(d) Subcontract flowdown. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in subcontracts--

(1) That exceed $150,000; and

(2) In which subcontractor employees will perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions (i.e., instead
of performance only by a self-employed individual).

operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling
or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In
determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of
employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements,
facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the
novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that
corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by
validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and
its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The
Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have
been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is
not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code
applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office,
along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 541618 assigned to contract number HC1028-14-R-
0001.

supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual
instrument, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial items, and require its subcontractorsor suppliers to do so,
without alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item

252.232-7007      LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION (MAY 2006)

(a) Contract line item(s) TBD through TBDare incrementally funded. For these item(s), the sum of $TBD  of the total price is presently available
for payment and allotted to this contract.  An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.

(b)  For items(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable
by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total
amount currently allotted to the contract.  The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government
will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of
anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT."  As used in this clause, the total amount
payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit and estimated
termination settlement costs for those item(s).

(c)  Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting
Officer in writing at least  ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the
total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then
allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s).  The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be
reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date
for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date.  The notification will also
advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s)
funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or
otherwise agreed to by the parties.  If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's
notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been
allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT".

(d)  When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the
parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds.  The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of
this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified
accordingly.

(e)  If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely
performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the
performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices
(including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both.  Failure to
agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled
"disputes."

(f)  The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in
paragraph (a) of this clause.

(g)  The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "DEFAULT."  The provisions of
this clause are limited to work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause.  This clause no
longer applies once the contract if fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments
negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause.

(h)  Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "TERMINATION
FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT."

(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C.
1342.

(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:

On execution of contract $--

 (month) (day), (year) $----    

 (month) (day), (year) $----    

 (month) (day), (year) $----

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have      , have not      , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in

*Note- The cost/price proposal shall be in Microsoft Excel version 2007 and include all formulas and calculations.

6.1.1 Cost/Price Reasonableness
This section is to assist you in submitting information other than cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness and
completeness of your proposed cost/price.  Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your
proposal.  Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal
from competition on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement.  Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk
to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror’s proposal.  Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their
reasonableness and completeness.

6.1.2 Estimating Techniques and Methods
Not used as this is a FFP contract.

6.1.3 Cost/Price Information
Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your
cost/price position.  All information relating to the proposed price to the SOW, including all required supporting documentation must be
included in the section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price volume.  Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be
included elsewhere in the proposal.

6.1.4 Cost or Pricing Information Requirements
In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support price
reasonableness and completeness.  Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5.  If, after receipt of proposals, the CO
determines that there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply,
the offeror may be required to submit certified cost or pricing data.

6.1.5  Pricing Proposal
The Offeror shall provide their price proposal on the Price Template (Attachment 9).  The price proposal shall reflect rates for the base period
and all option periods, including option pricing for an additional six-month period that may be authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8. See FAR 52.217-8
which authorizes the government to require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.
The price proposal spreadsheet includes a separate line item for the additional six-month period IAW FAR 52.217-8. These prices shall be
identical to the quoted pricing in the six months prior to expiration of the base period, or the final option period, if option periods are
present. The total evaluated price will consist of the contractor’s quoted price for the base period, all option periods, and option pricing for
the additional six-month period.  The labor rates in this section shall reflect the fully-burdened rates for each labor category and will apply
to all direct labor hours.

The “Total Evaluated Price” (Tab 6) will be the total cost for Labor (broken down by year), Travel/ODC’s and the total for the additional 6
month option.

Labor.  The Section B, Price Template shall include fully-loaded hourly rates for each skill classification that may be required throughout the
life of this effort.  The fully burdened hourly labor rates shall be one composite rate for each skill classification based upon composite
inputs of the prime and subcontractors (only first-tier subcontractors allowed), and all levels of seniority.  All labor related costs are part
of the fully burdened labor rates.  Labor and labor related costs shall not be reimbursed as an ODC.

6.1.6  Payment Plan
The Offeror shall propose a fixed price payment plan commensurate with the value of the deliverables and/or significant milestones in the SOW
for this requirement.  A firm fixed price payment plan with the total dollar amount divided into twelve (12) equal monthly payments will not be
accepted unless the schedule contractor provides justification for this plan that the Government subsequently deems adequate.  The eventual
awardee will be authorized to invoice monthly for all approved travel costs incurred and approved by the COR.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

M - EVALUATION FACTORS
M002 EVALUATION FACTORS AND BASIS FOR AWARD DETERMINATION

      a. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government using a LPTA
evaluation process with acceptable past performance.  Proposals will be evaluated with regard to how they respond to the requirements of the SOW
and on cost/price submissions.  The technical proposal should include all information the offeror wants the Government to consider and evaluate
regarding its company’s ability to perform all required tasks and conform to all required terms and conditions.  All aspects of the SOW must be
sufficiently addressed for a proposal to be considered responsive to the solicitation.  The best value determination will be based on the stated
evaluation factors.  In order to be eligible for award, a proposal must be responsive and meet or exceed the stated evaluation factors.  Section
508 Accessibility Standards do apply to this requirement.  Section 508 requirements are listed in the attached SOW.  Compliance with Section 508
standards will be considered prior to evaluating any of the selection criteria listed below.  Any proposal failing to meet the Section 508
Accessibility Standards, as listed in the SOW, may be eliminated from consideration for award.  Section 508 data may be submitted in Volume V –
Contract Documentation, and will not count towards the Technical page limit.

      b. After receipt of proposals, the Government will first evaluate the lowest price proposal.  If the lowest price proposal is determined
to be technically acceptable and otherwise properly awardable, no further evaluations will be conducted, and award will be made.  If, however,
the lowest price proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable and/or otherwise not properly awardable, further evaluations will be
conducted.

      c. The standards for determining technical acceptability are below, as well as information concerning cost/price proposals.

      (1) Technical/Management Approach Factor:  The Technical/Management Subfactors will be evaluated and rated either Acceptable or
Unacceptable.  In order for a proposal to be rated overall Technically Acceptable, each of the following subfactors must be rated Acceptable.

|Technical Ratings                                                                                            |
|Rating                  |Description                                                                         |
|Acceptable              |Proposal/quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.      |
|Unacceptable            |Proposal/quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the            |
|                        |solicitation.                                                                       |

           (a) Subfactor 1:  The Contractor's proposal explicitly identifies the planned FTEs for each task as identified in the SOW to
      demonstrate compliance with all FTE requirements.

           (b) Subfactor 2:  The Contractor's proposal demonstrates specific DISN ordering and provisioning process experience and expertise to
      ensure successful achievement of the task objectives in section 6.2.2 of the SOW.

           (c) Subfactor 3:  The Contractor's proposal demonstrates specific technical expertise in telecommunications wide area network (WAN)
      design and implementation, with particular emphasis on DOD WAN infrastructure, to ensure successful achievement of task objectives in
      section 6.2.8 of the SOW.

           (d) Subfactor 4: The Contractor's proposal explicitly enumerates software and server maintenance and sustainment experience and
      qualifications to ensure successful software sustainment of TCOSS objectives in section 6.5.1 of the SOW.

      (2) Past Performance Factor:

           (a)   Offerors will be evaluated on performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services with the past
      performance being rated as "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable."  In order to be rated Acceptable, the Government must determine that, based on
      the offeror’s performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required
      effort, or that the offeror’s performance record is unknown.  This factor will be rated Unacceptable if, based on the offeror’s performance
      record, the Government does not have a reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

           (b) Past performance efforts cited must be for similar services as outlined in the SOW, with satisfactory performance, and must have
      occurred within the last three (3) years.  No more than three (3) past performance efforts may be submitted, and each past performance
      effort submitted shall not exceed two pages.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information relative to present and past
      performance on its own, in addition to that provided by the offeror.  Past performance information may be obtained through the Past
      Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), through interviews with program managers on past efforts, or any other sources known to
      the government.

 The Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of past performance efforts  (DISA Supplemental Source Selection
Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 (S-90), Table 4.5):

|Definitions for Past Performance                                                                                                        |
|Rating                         |Description                                                                                             |
|Acceptable                     |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror |
|                               |will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror’s performance record is unknown.          |
|Unacceptable                   |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government does not have a reasonable expectation that   |
|                               |the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                                   |


      (3) Cost/Price Factor:

           (a) Price proposals will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR Part 15.404 in order to determine if they
      are reasonable, realistic, balanced, and complete.  Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and price analysis
      techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government will determine completeness of the offeror’s proposal by verifying that all
      solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and cost are presented in a clear and useful format.  For
      additional information see FAR 31.201-3.

           (b) The offeror shall submit pricing for the base period and all option periods, including option pricing for an additional six-month
      period that may be authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8.  See FAR 52.217-8 which authorizes the government to require continued performance of any
      services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  The pricing proposal should include a separate line item for the
      additional six-month period IAW FAR 52.217-8.  These prices shall be identical to the proposed pricing in the six months prior to
      expiration of the final option period.  The “Total Evaluated Price” (Attachment 8, Tab 6) will be the total cost for Labor (broken down by
      task) and Travel/ODC’s for the base and all option years, and the total for the additional 6 month option.

           (c)  Offerors shall propose a fixed price payment plan commensurate with the value of the deliverables and/or significant milestones
      in the SOW for this requirement.  A firm fixed price payment plan with the total dollar amount divided into twelve (12) equal monthly
      payments will not be accepted unless the offeror provides justification for this plan that the Government subsequently deems adequate.  The
      eventual awardee will be authorized to invoice monthly for all approved travel costs incurred and approved by the COR.

           (d) Offerors should ensure price proposals include detailed information regarding the resources required to accomplish the task
      (e.g., labor categories, labor hours, number of employees for each labor category, rates, travel, incidental equipment, etc.).  Again, the
      cost/price proposal spreadsheet shall be a separate document from the technical proposal.

           (e) Unbalanced Pricing.  Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing may
      increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable
      proposal, the price of one or more items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques.
      The Government will analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced items. Offers that are
      determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to
      the Government.

           (f) Due to the likely inability of any offeror to accurately estimate travel and material/equipment purchases associated with this
      requirement, the Government is providing plug numbers to be used by all offerors when proposing ODCs.  Offerors are instructed to propose
      plug numbers for ODCs in the following EXACT amounts, however actual travel shall be authorized by the Contracting Officer’s Representative
      (COR) in writing prior to performance and will be paid IAW FAR Part 31.205-46.

Travel/Equipment ODCs
Base Year:  $60,000.00
Opt Year 1: $60,000.00
Opt Year 2: $60,000.00
Opt Year 3: $60,000.00
Opt Year 4: $60,000.00
Total:           $300,000.00

These EXACT amounts shall include all audited markups and burdens and shall not be rounded or adjusted based upon independent decisions
regarding actual anticipated ODCs.  Failure to bid the plug numbers EXACTLY as provided may be cause to find a proposal  nonresponsive to this
RFP and exclude it from further consideration.

      d. Discussions
If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, the Final Proposal Revision
(FPR) will be the only document considered in making the source selection decision.


M003 SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and
technical/management requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors.  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of
the solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award.  Terms, exceptions, conditions, or assumptions will not be entertained.
