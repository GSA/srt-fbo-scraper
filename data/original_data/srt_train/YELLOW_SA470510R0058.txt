The Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) intends to issue a solicitation prior to October 1, 2010 for multiple award Indefinite
Delivery contracts to lease multifunction devices though out South Korea for a base year with options for three additional years.  The lease
terms will be for 48-months on an ‘option type’ delivery order. The pricing in effect at the time of the issuance of the delivery order will
prevail for the term of the lease. All maintenance, copies, and consumable supplies with the exception of staples and paper are to be supplied
as part of the lease price.  The base period minimum has not been established however historical records indicate placing approximately 270
devices within the first year throughout South Korea.

The maximum estimate for the base and all option periods is $38 million USD. This figure is only a possibility as the U.S. Government only has
to award the guaranteed minimum.

Devices will be ordered by volume bands.  All devices will be network, fax, print, and scan capable.  The only deviation is for devices that
will be used for classified materials. These devices will require a removable hard drive. Presently the six volume bands are:

      - VB0:  Minimum 15 copies per minute, 600 dpi or greater, with an expected monthly volume of 2,000 copies. This volume band is anticipated
to account for 43% of the orders.

      - VB1: Minimum 25 copies per minute, 600 dpi or greater, collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected monthly volume of 5,000
black and white, and 2,000 color copies.
This volume band is anticipated to account for 33% of the orders.

      - VB2: Minimum 30 copies per minute, 600 dpi or greater, collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected monthly volume of 10,000
black and white, and 5,000 color copies. This volume band is anticipated to account for 19% of the orders.


      - VB3: Minimum 40 copies per minute black and white, 35 copies per minute color, 600 dpi or greater,  collating and stapling capabilities,
with an expected monthly volume of  20,000 black and white, and 10,000 color copies. This volume band is anticipated to account for 3% of the
orders.


      - VB4: Minimum 50 copies per minute black and white, 45 copies per minute color, 600 dpi or greater,  collating and stapling capabilities,
with an expected monthly volume of  30,000 black and white, and 20,000 color copies. This volume band is anticipated to account for 2% of the
orders.


      - VB -5: Black & white with a minimum of 60 copies per minute, 600 DPI or greater, collating and stapling capabilities, with an expected
monthly volume of 80,000 copies per month for B/W.  Presently there are no known VB-5 requirements.


      - VB-6: Black and white with a minimum of 70 copies per minute, 600 DPI or greater, collating and stapling capabilities with an estimated
maximum of 120,000 copies per month for B/W.       Presently there are no known VB-6 requirements.

*  U.S. Army or Air Force security and configuration requirements.
      - U.S. Air Force AFI 33-200
      - U.S. Army; Secretary of the Army memo NETC-EST-IA dated 1 November 2005,
