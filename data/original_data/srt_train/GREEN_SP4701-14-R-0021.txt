Policy. In order to create a clean energy economy that will increase our Nation's prosperity, promote energy security, protect the interests of taxpayers, and safeguard the health of our environment, the Federal Government must lead by example. It is therefore the policy of the United States that Federal agencies shall increase energy efficiency; measure, report, and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect activities; conserve and protect water resources through efficiency, reuse, and stormwater management; eliminate waste, recycle, and prevent pollution; leverage agency acquisitions to foster markets for sustainable technologies and environmentally preferable materials, products, and services; design, construct, maintain, and operate high performance sustainable buildings in sustainable locations; strengthen the vitality and livability of the communities in which Federal facilities are located; and inform Federal employees about and involve them in the achievement of these goals. It is further the policy of the United States that to achieve these goals and support their respective missions, agencies shall prioritize actions based on a full accounting of both economic and social benefits and costs and shall drive continuous improvement by annually evaluating performance, extending or expanding projects that have net benefits, and reassessing or discontinuing under-performing projects. Finally, it is also the policy of the United States that agencies' efforts and outcomes in implementing this order shall be transparent and that agencies shall therefore disclose results associated with the actions taken pursuant to this order on publicly available Federal websites. Sec. 2. Goals for Agencies. In implementing the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, and preparing and implementing the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan called for in section 8 of this order, the head of each agency shall: (a) within 90 days of the date of this order, establish and report to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ Chair) and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a percentage reduction target for agency-wide reductions of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms by fiscal year 2020, relative to a fiscal year 2008 baseline of the agency's scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Where appropriate, the target shall exclude direct emissions from excluded vehicles and equipment and from electric power produced and sold commercially to other parties in the course of regular business. This target shall be subject to review and approval by the CEQ Chair in consultation with the OMB Director under section 5 of this order. In establishing the target, the agency head shall consider reductions associated with: (i) reducing energy intensity in agency buildings;

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or any other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap", or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify Offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply: (a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each Offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation. (b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide Offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the auction process.

(4) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead."

If a tie offer is submitted and no evaluation factors other than price were identified in the solicitation, the "Not Lead" Offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; otherwise its offer will be ineligible for award if their final price in the auction is the tie offer price. If evaluation factors in addition to price were listed in the solicitation, tie offers that are "Not Lead" will be considered and evaluated in accordance with those evaluation factors.

The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or reopen the reverse auction if the reason for the Offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the Offeror and outside the Offeror's control. (6) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that Offerors provide an alternate Offeror employee to become a Trained Offeror. The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the Trained Offeror's designation from any Trained Offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.

The Contracting Officer shall not award a contract until the Government determines any conflict of interest is reasonably resolved.

The OCI plan will not be evaluated as part of mission suitability. However, before being eligible to receive an award, the Offeror shall submit an acceptable OCI plan (including mitigation plans for any identified OCIs). As such, the Government may communicate with any Offeror at any time during the evaluation process concerning its OCI plan. (b) Description of Potential Conflict. The nature of this potential organizational conflict of interest is the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment or the existence of an unfair competitive advantage. A Contractor can create or represent an actual or potential Organization Conflict of Interest (OCI), if the contractor is currently providing support or anticipates support to the DLA Information Operations Office at Headquarters for commercial-off-the-shelf products (COTS) hardware and accessories. (c) Responsibility of Offeror. 1) Applying the principles of FAR Subpart 9.5, each Offeror shall assess whether there is an organizational conflict of interest associated with the proposal it submits.

Offerors may include the limitation of future contracting as well as a mitigation plan when their proposed resolution involves both techniques to address conflicts. 2) Offerors are encouraged to inform the Contracting Officer of any potential conflicts of interest, including those involving contracts with other Government organizations, in their proposal. The contracting officer will use this information to determine whether resolution of those conflicts will be required. 3) If the Offeror`s proposed action to resolve an organizational conflict of interest is not acceptable, the Contracting Officer will notify the Offeror, providing the reasons why its proposed resolution is not considered acceptable and allow the Offeror a reasonable opportunity to respond before making a final decision on the organizational conflict of interest. (d) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that ­ 1) there are no relevant facts that could give rise to an OCI, as defined in FAR Part 2; or 2) the Offeror has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflicts of interest. (e) Termination for default. If the successful Offeror was aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before award of this contract and did not fully disclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default. (f) Waiver. The agency reserves the right to waive the requirements of FAR 9.5, in accordance with FAR 9.503 D.4 DISCLOSURE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST AFTER CONTRACT AWARD

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION ­ COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA): FAR 15.306(c) (1) and DoD Source Selection Procedures handbook Section A.2 Offers will be evaluated based on the lowest offered price who meets the Government's minimum technical requirements of the solicitation. Offerors who do not take exception to the solicitation, meet the Government's minimum technical requirements of the solicitation, meet the minimum technical specifications of the Core List/Schedule of Supplies and the Statement of Work will be considered technically acceptable. All technically acceptable proposals will be evaluated for price reasonableness and award will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable offer. See pages 7-12 for minimum technical specifications and pages 43-47 for Statement of Work. _______________________________________________

Technical and past performance, when combined are: N/A _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION Proposals will be evaluated for technical acceptability and not ranked using the non-price factors/subfactors. The Technical Evaluation, in the form of the product description and specifications listed in the Schedule of Supplies (See pages 7-12) and Statement of Work (See pages 43-47), provides the technical acceptability of Lot 0001 (Desktop/Laptop/Options and Upgrades) and Lot 0002 (Tablets/Thin-Client and Options and Upgrades).

Solicitation Number SP4701-14-R-0021

Page: 55 of 71

The offeror's price proposal evaluation will include a review of the proposed total acquisition price for each Lot based on the total price of all line items identified on the schedule of supplies, options and upgrades listed in the statement of work (SOW) and scope of this solicitation. The total proposed price of all items listed for Lot 0001(Desktop/Laptop/Options and Upgrades) and Lot 0002 (Tablets/Thin-Client and Options and Upgrades will be evaluated separately by lot.

NON-PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION Past performance will also be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process. It will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305 and rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. The assessment will be based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the products and/or services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. Past Performance will first be evaluated to determine if the offeror has relevant or non-relevant past performance. Past Performance will then be evaluated to determine how well the offeror performed on past contracts. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable".

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
