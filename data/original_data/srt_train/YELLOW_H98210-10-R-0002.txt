                                                                STATEMENT OF WORK

                                                 DEFENSE SEXUAL ASSAULT INCIDENT DATABASE (DSAID)


1     INTRODUCTION

1.1   The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) requires a system to meet Section 563 of Public Law 110-417, the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2009.  The system will be called the Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID) and
will utilize a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) Case Management System (CMS) software package.

1.2   When implemented, DSAID will support policy, program implementation and victim care on matters relating to sexual assault within the Armed
Forces; enhance the transparency of sexual assault-related data while adhering to the privacy and restricted reporting[1] options for sexual
assault victims; provide accurate and timely reporting of sexual assault incidents; use data as an enabler to enhance analysis and trend
identification capabilities; inform policy and allow for evaluation of SAPRO and Service Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) programs.

2     BACKGROUND

The NDAA FY09 mandated that the Secretary of Defense implement a centralized, case-level database for the collection and maintenance of
information regarding sexual assaults involving a member of the Armed Forces.

3     SCOPE

3.1   The government intends to award a Fixed Priced, Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a base period of 12 months
and four one year option periods.  During the base period, the contractor will design and develop a web-based, customized and configurable, COTS
CMS in which functionality will ultimately transfer from a development server to a production server.  The production server will be hosted by
the government.  During the option periods, the contractor shall complete any interfaces not completed in the base period, provide licenses for
maintenance and upgrades to the software and respond to task orders for increased functionality as a result of additional requirements to
include Congressional mandates.

3.2   When completed, DSAID will capture and maintain victim case management data (restricted and unrestricted[2]), incident data (restricted
and unrestricted), subject demographic data (unrestricted), subject disposition data (per Congressional requirements and as defined by
SAPRO/Services) (unrestricted), and SAPR program administration data.

The data maintained in the system will be received, when appropriate, from Service systems that capture sexual assault data to include Military
Criminal Investigative Organizations’ (MCIO) and Offices of the Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) systems.  In addition, when necessary, Sexual
Assault Response Coordinators (SARC) will contribute both restricted and unrestricted data.

4     REQUIREMENTS

4.1   Overview

DSAID will encompass five functional capabilities to include, reporting, data entry, data interface, case management, and business management.
Reporting functionality will allow SAPRO the ability to electronically develop Congressionally mandated reports and facilitate trend analysis.
Data entry and data interfaces will enable DSAID to receive case-level data from SARCs and/or Service systems which will allow for timely
responses to departmental and Congressional inquiries and will alleviate redundant data entry.  This capability will help ensure that DSAID
meets the Congressional mandate requiring the implementation of a “centralized, case-level database.”  The case management functionality will
enable Air Force and National Guard SARCs to input and maintain victim data pertaining to a sexual assault directly into DSAID. Finally,
business management functionality will provide SARCs and Service SAPR program managers’ administration and management capabilities through case
management reviews and meeting minutes.

   2. Functional Requirements

The DSAID requirements are captured within the DSAID Requirements Package that consists of the following documents.  Copies of these documents
can be found on www.sapr.mil, under “Highlights” at “Response to H98210-10-R-0002.”

    • DSAID Requirements Package Overview and Supplemental Requirements

    • DSAID Use Case Model

performance, and schedule requirements for this effort.  The TOMP shall detail the technical solution, methods for configuring and customizing
the technical solution, and a timeline for producing the technical solution.

6.1.2 Test Plan.  The contractor shall develop a Task Order specific Test Plan that identifies critical issues, assesses perceived quality
risks, identifies Information Assurance (IA) impact, verifies requirements, and demonstrates progress for Unit Testing, System Testing,
Regression Testing and Performance Testing, and deliver Test Plan, procedures, and results as specified by each Task Order.

    • The DSAID Requirements Package:  The DSAID Requirements Package posted on the website (www.sapr.mil, under “Highlights” at “Response to

      on the above website.  Upon contract award, the awardee will receive the final baseline requirements at the Post Award Conference.
    • Alternate Schedule:  Keeping with the contract type, offerors may propose an alternate Schedule to the one listed in this solicitation.
    • Licenses/Maintenance:  Software Licenses and Maintenance/Upgrades are not included in the current Schedule.  Should any of these item(s) be
      required, offerors shall propose an alternate Schedule which includes the appropriate item(s).

2.  Communication with the Contracting Officer:  Solicitation information and amendments will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities
website at www.fbo.gov.  Offerors may email written questions requesting clarification of the Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Contract

              task order is a sample and not a real requirement of DSAID.  The pricing provided will be used to evaluate offerors understanding

52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (DEC 2008)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business
segment; and similar positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

[List as necessary]

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA,
the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.
The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines
that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling
or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In
determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of
employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements,
facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the
novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that
corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause
by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central
Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting
office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the
date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is
not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code
applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office,
along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

           award.

         o Unacceptable: The proposal fails to meet the stated requirements.  The response is considered deficient in terms of basic content and
           support the Government seeks for evaluation.  The degree of risk is so high that there is little or no likelihood of success;
           regardless of price.

     2. Ratings for Factor 2: Past Performance:  One of the following ratings will be assigned:

         o Satisfactory: Indicates that the Offeror’s qualifications are at a level that would normally be expected in the commercial
           marketplace.  The Offeror’s proposal sufficiently addresses all or most of the elements.  The past performance record represents that
           the Offeror is capable of adequately performing the requirement.  This rating indicates a low level of performance risk to the
           Government.

         o Neutral: Indicates that the Offeror’s references could not be verified or that the Offeror lacks relevant past performance
           experience.

         o Unacceptable: Indicates that the Offeror has historically failed to perform in a satisfactory manner in the   fulfillment of like or
           similar requirements.  This rating indicates an unacceptable level of performance risk.

     3. Ratings of Factor 3: Price:  Price proposals will not be point scored.




                                                                   ATTACHMENT B

                                    INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSING AN INITIAL COMMERCIAL ITEM SUBCONTRACTING PLAN

TYPE OF PLAN -- Any large business quoter/offeror that does not have an approved small business subcontracting plan must submit a proposed plan
to the Contracting Officer.  This form, when submitted, is a proposed Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  It is the preferred
type of subcontracting plan for this procurement, though the quoter/offeror may use a noncommercial plan instead.  Commercial plans are good for
the contractor's fiscal year, and do not have to be renegotiated for each contract requiring a plan.  Noncommercial plans are good for the life
of the contract involved, but must be renegotiated for each contract requiring a plan.  Quoter/offerors desiring to propose noncommercial plans
should obtain a noncommercial plan form from the Contracting Officer.

PLAN SUBMITTAL -- A quoter/offeror submitting a proposed commercial plan must submit it to the first Contracting Officer awarding a contract
subject to the plan during the Contractor's fiscal year.  This proposed plan must be submitted as part of the quote/offer.  If that Contracting
Officer is a DHRA Contracting Officer, the plan must have at least the information shown on the following pages.  Quoter/offerors submitting
plans to DHRA are requested to use the format shown on the following pages in their submittal.  (Plans already approved must be included in the
offer in place of this form).  Upon approval, this plan will become part of the contract upon award.  It will also apply to all other Government
contracts with the contractor for the life of the plan.

IDENTITY OF CONTRACTING OFFICER NEGOTIATING PLAN -- Before a plan is approved, quoters/offerors are requested to supply the identity of the
Contracting Officer negotiating the initial plan to all other Contracting Officers governmentwide that are responsible for any procurement that
could result in a contract subject to this plan.  This identity information should include the name, title, address and telephone number (as
well as e-mail address, if known) of the Contracting Officer negotiating the initial plan.

PLAN START AND END DATES -- The proposed plan must specify the first and last dates when this plan will apply.  If the format on the following
pages is used, this is the "Period Covered By Plan."  The Contracting Officer will specify the starting date.  The quoter/offeror must specify
the ending date.  The ending date must be the last date of the quoter/offeror's current fiscal year.  If that ending date is fewer than 30
federal government working days from the starting date, the quoter/offeror must either (a) fill in the ending date with the last date of the
Contractor's next fiscal year, or (b) complete the Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Renegotiation/Renewal) in addition to
this form.  (Using the ending date of the quoter/offeror's next fiscal year is usually much simpler.)  Ensuing plans will coincide with the
contractor's fiscal year.

REASONABLE GOALS -- The quoter/offeror must select goals that are reasonable based on making good faith efforts (to be described in this plan)
to use small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, service disabled veteran owned small business, and women-owned small business subcontractors
to the maximum extent practicable.  Contracting Officers will reject plans with unreasonably low goals, or efforts described herein that are not
good faith efforts.

QUESTIONS -- Should quoters/offerors have any questions, they should contact the Contracting Officer/Contract Specialist for this
solicitation/contract.

PERIOD COVERED BY PLAN:  This plan applies from ___________ [Contracting Officer fill in the first date of contract performance.  For supply
contracts, this is the date of contract award] to ______________.  [Contractor fills in the last date of their current fiscal year.  If there
will be fewer than 30 federal government working days between the start date and the end of the Contractor's current fiscal year, the Contractor
must either (a) fill in the date of the Contractor's next fiscal year, or (b) complete the Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan
(Renegotiation/Renewal) in addition to this form.  (Using the ending date of the Contractor's next fiscal year is usually much simpler.)]

[1] Restricted Reporting is a process used by a Service member to report or disclose that he or she is the victim of a sexual assault to
specified officials on a requested confidential basis.  Under these circumstances, the victim’s report and any details provided to healthcare
personnel, the SARC, or a Victim Advocate (VA) will not be reported to law enforcement to initiate the official investigative process unless the
victim consents or an established exception is exercised under the Department of Defense Directive 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and
Response (SAPR) Program.
[2] Unrestricted Reporting is a process a Service member uses to disclose, without requesting confidentiality or restricted reporting, that he
