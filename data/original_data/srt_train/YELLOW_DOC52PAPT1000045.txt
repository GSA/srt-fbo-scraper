1.0 BACKGROUND 1.1 A New State-of-the-Art Information Technology Infrastructure

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is re-designing the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure associated with the patent examination process. An entirely new architecture is being designed, including a new service-oriented architecture, enterprise workflow management, and content management and database systems resulting in a fundamental redesign of patent processing and operations. Due to the legacy nature of the existing IT system, the current examination system and its user interfaces fall into silos. Examiners have to launch a multitude of separate applications and copy and paste information from one to another. Work products have to be saved to the desktop for later use rather than integrated into one view. Most applications are run on individual's computers rather than on centralized servers. The interfaces themselves have an appearance of legacy systems. The legacy system processes documents as TIFF images rather than as text, so considerable desirable functionality is limited, including cut-and-paste from the document images, searching over the original documents (must be done over an Optical Character Recognition (OCR'd) version that the examiner must produce themselves), and the ability to select structured components from the documents. Literature that is submitted along with the patent application is also scanned and turned into TIFF images which must be OCR'd in order to be searched. The new system will represent patent applications and existing patents as structured (XML) text. The ultimate goal of this project is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible in order to accomplish user goals. The stakeholders desire a simple, unified interface that does not require launching of separate applications in separate windows, and that supports new and improved IT advances. The new architecture shall most likely support thin-client, remote-hosted applications. The design process must balance technical and visual functionality in order to create system interfaces that are operational but usable and adaptable to user needs and changing agency infrastructure. Much of the task analysis phase has been completed, however more assistance and support is needed to move to the design, implementation and deployment phases of the project. Under this task order the offeror will create and evaluate usable, compelling and engaging interface design solutions that result in exceptional user experiences and improve the examiner process while meeting stakeholder needs. 1.2 Context of Use 1.2.1 Key Internal Stakeholders Patent examiners study the cases in their docket and make legal decisions about the status of the cases. The Supervisory Patent Examiner (SPE) is the front-line manager who manages groups of examiners organized into subject matter specializations called art areas. Art areas are further organized into Technology Centers (TC). The SPEs manage a docket of cases, which correspond to the dockets of the examiners whom they supervise. SPEs help junior examiners and check their work before it is sent out as an office action. SPEs also interact with other SPEs on issues of balancing and assigning patent workload, as well as on special projects. Legal Instruments Examiners (LIEs), who are members of the Technical Support Staff (TSSs) check the work of the examiner and ensure all procedural formalities have been met. They also process incoming patents in various ways. 3

8/27/2010 DRAFT COMBINED SYNOPSIS-SOLICITATION DOC52PAPT1000045 User Interface Design for Patents End-to-End IT System
Key stakeholder types ˇ Patent examiners o Junior o Primary o Hotelers (patent examiners who work primarily out of the office) ˇ SPEs (Supervisory Patent Examiners ­ first level management) ˇ Technical Support Staff (TSSs) ˇ EICs (Electronic Information Centers - technical librarians who aid examiners) Other ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ important internal stakeholders Technology education staff Upper and middle management Data analyzers Employees who assign patents to art units Employees who classify patents Employees responsible for intake of patent applications Employees responsible for publishing of granted patent applications IT staff (OCIO and SIRA)

External stakeholders and external interfaces are also very important, but these are not being addressed in this task. 1.2.2 Basic Workflow of Patent Examination Patent examination requires considerable technical and legal expertise. The process through which a patent application can move is also potentially complicated. Nonetheless, the heart of the IT support needed for patent examination can be described somewhat succinctly. A patent application enters the agency by being submitted by an applicant (a law firm, an independent inventor, etc). The application is processed and checked in a variety of ways, and the applicant receives notification of the status of their application, payment information, etc. An application is a document composed of several sections, the most important of which are the claims, the specification or description, the abstract, and the drawings. It also contains metadata such as the date of filing, the inventors' names, the application number, and so on. In the new system, the patent will be represented internally as an XML document. Eventually the patent is assigned to a patent examiner for examination; a patent case assigned to an examiner is called a docket. The typical workflow for an examiner working with a new application is: ˇ ˇ ˇ Read the application o Annotate the application with notes o Build a "claim tree" or other diagram to express relationships among the claims Check the application for compliance to various requirements Conduct the prior art search o Formulate a search plan o Search the literature for relevant prior art  Search the patent literature  Optionally search external (non-patent) literature  Optionally use specialized search tools (for chemical structures, etc)  Optionally search specialized databases Compose a decision Write up a legal document called an Office Action that describes the decision and the reasons for that decision 4

ˇ ˇ

8/27/2010 DRAFT COMBINED SYNOPSIS-SOLICITATION DOC52PAPT1000045 User Interface Design for Patents End-to-End IT System
Despite the linear description above, examination is an iterative process. In some cases the examiner will interact with their direct manager (called a SPE) or a more advanced examiner (called a Primary Examiner) to discuss the case and the decision. Junior examiners' work must be checked by a SPE before being sent onward; primary examiners can complete their office actions without further review of the substance. Before the office action is sent to the applicant, the formalities are checked by a member of the technical support staff (called an LIE); if errors are found the examiner is required to fix the problems. For a junior examiner, the amended office action may have to again go through the SPE before being sent to the applicant. The applicant can respond to the office action with arguments, corrections, and amendments; the timing for this response is subject to various deadlines. In some cases the examiner speaks with an applicant on the phone or in person. Eventually the amended case appears in the examiner's docket. When the examiner returns to this case, he or she further processes the application in light of the new information. The second office action is usually considered "final." If the decision is a rejection, the applicant can abandon the case or take several different paths for reconsideration. If it is accepted, various procedures are followed in order to publish the patent, complete the paperwork with the applicant, etc. The examiner must manage many cases in their docket simultaneously, and these cases can be at different stages within the examination process. Examiners currently work within a "count" system which is centered on when different work products are completed and often have different deadlines to keep track of. 1.3 Analysis: Recent and Ongoing User Research

Extensive user research has been and is being gathered. For the office action writing and examiner's docket management tasks, a large focus group was conducted in January 2009 and results obtained and compiled. More recently, a contractor conducted observations and timed studies of the current office action and docket management tools, as well as interviews with examiner proxies about these tasks. This work produced a set of recommendations for new interfaces as well as an initial set of wireframes. Still more recently, a survey was conducted to obtain high level business goals for the examiner corps. A clear desire for fast, simple, configurable tools resulted from this questionnaire. Focus groups and interviews are currently underway to develop task analysis that is Technology Center specific, focusing on the role of search and classification and how their use differs across subject matter areas. From these, a set of personas will be developed to keep track of any important differences across examiners. In the coming months, user research will be done with SPEs and EICs. Simultaneously, a large effort at process re-engineering is underway and its results will form the design of the new IT system and its user interfaces. Other relevant documents are also available that describe design and feature requirements that have been developed previously. 2.0 OBJECTIVES

The task objective is to provide user interface designs for the USPTO's Patents End-to-End IT project. The process uses is a user-centered design where each stage of the design is tested with stakeholders and proxies. The contractor will make use of user research previously conducted, and will work with the government to do additional user research and to usability test design artifacts. 5

8/27/2010 DRAFT COMBINED SYNOPSIS-SOLICITATION DOC52PAPT1000045 User Interface Design for Patents End-to-End IT System
The ultimate goal is to improve examining and patents processing by meeting the stakeholders' goal to have better user interfaces for patents processing, better communication and collaboration interfaces and to accommodate new and improved patents business processes. Major steps for the User Interfaces for Patents End-to-End task are: ˇ Review the results of user research already conducted by the government, as well as other relevant material about the process of patent examination and design of current systems. If necessary, the government will conduct additional user research or optionally the contractor will conduct limited user research directly. Create user interfaces for patent examiners, managers, technical support staff, and other stakeholders that meet standard usability criteria (learnability, efficiency, memorability, error reduction, and user satisfaction/enjoyment) and that meet special criteria as determined by internal user research (fast, simple, flexible, configurable, integrated into one or few interfaces, promotes collaboration and communication, and supports integration of advanced tools such as intelligent search and linguistic analysis, supports data validation and autofill, and supports alerts and notifications). Design these interfaces using an iterative, user-centered process with the expectation that stakeholders will review and comment on designs, and those designs will be adjusted and retested until satisfactory results are obtained. Much of the usability testing will be done by government workers although the contractor will in some cases do usability testing as well. In the early stages of design, create at least two different overall interaction designs that differ significantly from one another in order to give stakeholders more than one option to choose from. Develop artifacts for communication with stakeholders about the design, at all stages of the design process (wireframes, storyboards, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, graphic design, and so on). These artifacts can include paper prototypes, video, web-accessible clickable prototypes, and other materials. Artifacts that can be posted online will be emphasized in order to increase the stakeholder feedback. Organize and analyze user research conducted by government or contractor staff on design artifacts. Optionally, after the core design has been usability tested and approved for adoption; develop software standards and requirements for implementation of the interface. Optionally, implement the interfaces working with the software integrator contractor. Optionally, design, evaluate, and write software requirements for additional functionality associated with user research results. SUPPLIES/SERVICES LABOR CATEGORY QTY RATE $ $ $ $ $ $ $ TOTAL

Requirements for New User Interfaces

Final user interface designs must meet the following criteria: ˇ Support office-specific usability goals of speed, simplicity, flexibility, configurability, and integration of functionality into few windows or tools. ˇ Support standard usability goals of: learnability, efficiency, memorability, error reduction, and user satisfaction/enjoyment. ˇ Present large amounts of textual information in a clear, uncluttered, scalable manner. ˇ Be aesthetically pleasing, flexible and configurable, so that individuals can tailor the interface to their needs. ˇ Be easily modifiable so that additional functionality can be added or existing functionality removed, while remaining easy to use. ˇ Support remote work for a nationwide workforce. ˇ Be able to interface well with Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products that have welldefined Application Programming Interface (APIs). ˇ Support accessibility to a high degree, going beyond 508-compliance to support audio input and output and/or other technologies that improve accessibility. ˇ Provide keyboard or other non-audio shortcuts for skilled users. ˇ Be easily adapted to modern technologies not currently in use such as touch screen interfaces, 3D interfaces, and mobile devices. ˇ Support multilingual search and display Uniform Transformation Format (UTF-16) 4.3 Functionality for New User Interfaces 4.3.1 Introduction The functionality below shall be included in the new design, subject to results of usability testing. This is not an exhaustive list of required functionality, and more may be revealed by additional user research. Patent examination is an information-rich, and in most cases, text-rich enterprise. New user interfaces must be able to present this information in a clear, uncluttered, scalable manner. User research conducted so far has revealed a need for new functionality that is not supported in the current system. In many cases, multiple patent examiners are searching over the same information using the same or similar queries and viewing the same or similar content. For this reason, there is much advantage to be gained by supplying examiners with interfaces that allow for storing and sharing of annotations, tags, previously issues queries, and previously viewed documents. The design challenge is to develop interfaces and backend tools that can help users manage and use this information in a timely manner without creating information overload. Additionally, many patent office staff work from home or some other remote location, and the number who do so is expected to increase to align with the federal government's interest in telework and office's interest in supporting a nationwide workforce. Changes in the underlying architecture will better facilitate this goal, but the interfaces as well must be designed with this need in mind, both for allowing examination to take place on different screen sizes and for optimizing for offline work and for communication with co-workers who are remotely located. 8

8/27/2010 DRAFT COMBINED SYNOPSIS-SOLICITATION DOC52PAPT1000045 User Interface Design for Patents End-to-End IT System
4.3.2 Viewing and Manipulating Patent Applications Patent applications are highly structured documents with many parts including accompanying documentation and prosecution history for currently open cases. The examiner needs to be able to view and select portions of the application in an easy way and see associated annotations, patent family members, and so on. When reading the patent it would be useful to have figures that are referenced in the text viewable via a hover or some other device associated with the figure number inline in the text. Viewing of the application must be tightly integrated with writing office actions, comparing claims and other parts of the documents with other text, performing search, and seeing the status in the context of other work. 4.3.3 Writing Office Actions The office action writing tool should create structured documents. Currently office actions are typically put together by selecting and modifying previously written text. This text should be readyat-hand for use in the office action. If the user has already searched for examples of other office actions, relevant passages from those actions should be ready at hand to be used in the current action. Some pre-defined text comes from user manuals (such as the MPEP) and is often reused; this also should be ready-at-hand for the current office action. The current tools result in irregular formatting that has to be hand-corrected by the examiner; including text from elsewhere should result in automatically correctly formatted text. Sometimes this re-usable text has slots that refer to metadata specific to the particular application, such as the application number, date, etc. Currently the examiner has to manually enter this information, but instead it should be automatically populated with the relevant information for the application. The examiner should be able to set certain pieces of metadata that are then used throughout construction of the office action, such as critical dates. The examiner should also be able to set which statute they are using for a rejection decision. The system should keep track of how many pieces of prior art are used in the office action and warn the user that the statute setting is incorrect if the examiner uses a number of bibliographic references that are incompatible with the rejection statute chosen. 4.3.4 Comparing Claims and other Parts of Texts In many circumstances, examiners need tools to compare texts to one another. This includes comparing the claims in an amended application to the original claims, comparing claims in an application to those of prior art, and comparing the claims across patents in a patent family. Examiners also need tools to compare texts between NPL and patent applications. Several different interfaces for comparing texts should be experimented with; it may be necessary to support more than one. 4.3.5 Collaboration and Docket Management, including Alerts Management of individual cases and the entire document should be seamlessly integrated with the tools for writing office actions and performing search. A simple yet effective alerting system is needed for helping examiners, SPEs, and LIEs be aware of which information items are ready for processing and what deadlines are coming. Timely, relevant alerts are a key user goal for the system. Examiners also need to be able to adjust the prioritization of goals and see the impact of adjusting prioritization on their work productivity counts, in real time.

9

8/27/2010 DRAFT COMBINED SYNOPSIS-SOLICITATION DOC52PAPT1000045 User Interface Design for Patents End-to-End IT System
Some examiners often communicate and collaborate with members of the EIC (technical librarians) who run searches for them. Typically this communication is a request for the EIC to run a search for the examiner. The communication for these should be integrated with the rest of the tools. When an EIC search has completed, the results should appear in the examiner's document affixed to the appropriate case(s). Examiners and SPEs should be able to share workspaces with one another when desired; pairs or groups should be able to share and work on cases together if desired. When an examiner completes an office action, the SPE or a primary examiner looks over the work and may annotate the document with corrections or desired changes. The examiner then must make the requested corrections or continue the discussion with their supervisor. This can take several rounds of conversation and may involve searching for or referring to additional prior art. It is critical that the markup and annotations used in this conversation are stored in a different layer than the version of the record that is sent on to the patent applicant. The office action is then sent to an LIE for checking for conformance to various criteria. The LIE must be able to communicate with the examiner and the SPE about any issues with the patent. 4.3.6 Incorporating Search Tools Prior art search is the most time-consuming part of the patent examination process. Most examiners currently make heavy use of a Boolean-based command-language search tool whose outstanding feature is the ability to flexibly specify proximity operators. Because the algorithm is Boolean with no ranking, the search strategy surrounds reducing the set of documents retrieved to a reasonable number, rather than looking at top hits. A query is run and a result is shown in terms of the number of documents retrieved. A new query is then run, often incorporating the line number of the previous query. After a reasonable sized results list is found, examiners then "flip" through the patents looking quickly at the cover page. Adjustable keyword highlighting is critical to this view. However, there is currently no provision of a standard search results listing with keywords in context view, although when asked some examiners express interest in such a tool. Examiners using the new system should have a variety of additional tools at their fingertips to support different, complementary approaches to search, as well as tools to aid in the search process. This includes tools that suggest thesaurus terms, that allow for faceted navigation, that support search of equations, number ranges, chemical structures, figures, and so on. In addition, support should be provided for similarity-based search tools and keyword-based tools. Similarity-based tools should be easily executable from a selected piece of text. Upon opening a new application, a search should have already been automatically run that uses similarity search to propose the most relevant documents. Users should also be able to use pieces of documents as input to similarity based tools. The interface should support search over drawings (images) with the patents and other documents, including using experimental content-based image search tools. One of the most problematic parts of the examination process is the incorporation of Non-Patent Literature (NPL) search into the rest of the tool. Currently the various proprietary tools are accessed through a variety of interfaces. There are attempts to federate some subsets of this search, but the results are inadequate. Really examiners want all NPL search incorporated with the core patent search tools. An excellent design for federated search interfaces is needed, that takes into account the problems of the differing underlying backend systems, including the fact that some systems index full text and some abstracts, and the underlying query languages differ. 10

8/27/2010 DRAFT COMBINED SYNOPSIS-SOLICITATION DOC52PAPT1000045 User Interface Design for Patents End-to-End IT System
As mentioned above, the search tools should be integrated with information about prior searches, documents that have been used by the examiner themselves, other people working on similar patent applications, related office actions, and so on. Examiners should be able to search documents that are cited by the current document, or that that documents cites, or all documents written by a given author or research group. The interface should be able to accommodate additions of optional advanced search interface tools, such as sense-making tools and information visualization tools. It should be possible to seamlessly move between such tools, with queries and retrieved documents retained as sets between views. 4.3.7 Finding and Using Prior Art Documents Prior art documents (patents, foreign patents, and non-patent literature (NPL)) should have a structured format that allows well-defined portions of the documents to be referenced elsewhere. That is, if a user selects a paragraph or other subset of the document for inclusion in an office action, or in personal or shared notes, the text should be recorded in that note and the reference back to the original document should also be retained. Selection might include clicking (successive clicks grab successively larger portions of the text), lassoing, highlighting, creation of sticky notes, or other operations found to be useful. Commands to translate portions of documents must be easily run and the results easily incorporated. Once a document has been registered in the system, the bibliography should be a part of that document. The search system should recognize whether or not a document in the results list is one that has been registered in the system. If so, when the icon for the document is dragged and dropped, or the document is otherwise selected, its bibliographic information is retained with it. Furthermore, if the document is being used for the first time, it should be cached in the system and future accesses to that document should automatically point the user to the cached version. Search results and other tools should flag or otherwise indicate whether or not a document has been cached within the system. 4.3.8 Editing and Sharing Structured Content One set of desired new features centers around selecting and using pieces of structured content, and editing documents using structured content, for automatically filling in metadata where appropriate and for providing automated checks against entered information for error reduction. COTS products such as Lexis-Nexis PatentOptimizer, PatentTools, and TeamPatent have been developed that automatically perform checks against patent applications and build representations of the claim structure. The new interface should be able to seamlessly integrate results of such automated processing. Another new kind of required functionality allows the examiner and the SPE to communicate about modifications needed for office actions. The SPE requires a way to see which changes have been made by the examiner vis-ŕ-vis their suggested changes. This communication needs to take place with specific permissions or layers so that the discussion of the modifications does not become part of the official record of the office action. As users currently use a wide range of ad hoc methods to support this kind of communication, it may be necessary to provide more than one interface solution for this need. One innovative idea that has received positive user response is the ability for SPEs to leave voice messages affixed to specific parts of documents rather than typing email messages. The ability to use audio for annotations and other functions (in addition to keyboard command) should be designed into the new interface.

User research reveals a need for a simple yet effective alerting system for helping examiners, SPEs, and LIEs be aware of which information items are ready for processing and what deadlines are coming. Timely, relevant alerts are a key user goal for the system, as is the desire for a centralized location for such communication. 4.3.9 Annotations, Bookmarks, and Tags Annotations and stored-for-later function (bookmarks) should be affixable to all information items within the system. This includes search queries, synonym lists, search results, patent applications, drawings, equations, chemical structures within patent applications and published patents, office actions, NPL, and other document artifacts. Annotations should include tags, chosen either from a pre-defined set (and searchable with autosuggest functionality) or made up by the individual. Tags should be shareable, navigable, and searchable. It should be possible to create groups of tags for analysis for elevating to a shared status for future classification efforts. When annotated items are shown in a list or other summary format, some kind of indicator should show which items have annotations associated with them. Annotations should be searchable and viewable in search results. Drawings and other images should be annotatable. Annotations upon drawings and other parts of art should be viewable in the summary view of documents throughout the system. Shareable status of annotations should be settable by the annotator. Sharing should be possible across art units, TCs, and ad hoc groups such as all the people who are working on members of a patent family. 4.3.10 Document Groups, Prior Searches and Art Ad hoc groups of documents should be formable, and available for sharing and searching. They should have a facility to assign names and tags and to be organized in well-defined places. Saved documents should include sections of manuals and sample office actions. Saved documents should be able to be associated with particular cases or in a globally accessible store. All documents associated with a case should be automatically recorded, viewable, and searchable as such. It should be easy to quickly open or hide all documents associated with a case. These should be automatically recorded with the ability for pruning or boosting in importance. A user should be able to see searches conducted by other people that are relevant to the current case. They should also be able to see prior art documents that are frequently used among this group, optionally for particular query terms. They should also be able to see synonym lists and precanned queries. The definition of who these groups of people are should be controllable to particular individuals, art units, TCs, and ad hoc groups. These views should be sharable. However, individuals should be able to control which items are not sharable in an easy and obvious manner. A user should be able to view previous searches, documents, and other artifacts associated with the office actions for a particular patent application. Users should be able to search the texts and annotations for earlier office actions, as well as filter by person or art unit that worked on the application. The user should be able to search manuals such as the MPEP (Manual of Patent Examination and Processing), statutes and court decisions, and annotations on these documents left by other users. 12

4.3.11 Incorporating Classification Systems Patents are currently classified into multiple classification systems. Prior art should be navigable by one or more category systems. A new approach which is a combination of the IPC (International Patent Classification) system and faceted metadata is being explored. The interface should allow for browsing of prior art by classification data, including incorporating keywords search into classification browsing. The interface should also provide an interface for suggestions of user-generated tags for promotion into the formal classification system. It may be desirable to develop a separate interface that designated individuals monitor in order to determine which tags should be promoted and to group together synonymous tags. 4.3.12 SPE and LIE Dashboards The LIE typically processes more than a dozen applications a day that are queued up for them by their supervisor. The SPE must balance a rich and complex workload, distributing applications among their examiners, communicating with other SPEs, and balancing productivity deadlines. There is a desire to move away from email-based alerting to a tool that allows for ordering and organizing tasks. Other tools are needed for report generation and data analysis of patent processing status. 5.0 CONTRACT TYPE

Secrecy and Use of Patent Information Work under this contract does not affect the national security. However, patent applications are required by law (35 U.S.C. 122) to be kept in confidence. Information contained in any patent application file(s) is restricted to authorized Contractor personnel on a need-to-know basis. The Contractor acquires no right or privilege to use or disclose any information contained in any patent application file (in any form whatsoever) except to perform the work under the contract. Further, the Contractor shall not copyright or make any use or disclosure whatsoever of any patent information contained in any application or related copy or data furnished to the Contractor by the Government, or obtained by the Contractor from the Government, except performing the requirements of this contract. Security requirements of patent application file data maintained in a computer-accessible medium are an extension of the security requirements for the hard copy or of patent application folders. All processing, storage, or transmission of patent application file data by means of electronic communications systems is prohibited unless use of such systems is approved by the USPTO. All personnel having access to patent application files or data or information concerning the same, must take the following affirmation, signed in writing: "I do swear or affirm that I will preserve the applications for patents in secrecy, that I will not divulge any information concerning the same to unauthorized persons while employed in work under this contract or an any time thereafter, and that I take this obligation freely, and without mental reservation or purpose of evasion." Each employee's signed oath, or affirmation, shall be retained in the Contractor's file, subject to inspection by authorized Government representatives. Without advance notice, the Government shall have the right to inspect the Contractor's premises, records, and work in process pertaining to the secrecy of patent information. PTO-06 Limitation on Contractor Advertisements The Contractor agrees not to refer to awards in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service provided is endorsed or preferred by the Federal Government or is considered by the Government to be superior to other products or services. Advertisements, press releases and publicity of a contract by a supplier shall not be made without the prior express written permission of the Contracting Officer. (End of clause)

PTO-10 Agency-Level Protest Procedures (DEC 1996) a. PURPOSE: To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12979, which directs heads of executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for resolving protests to awards of procurement contracts within their agencies at a level above the Contracting Officer. Authority to administer procurementrelated directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Management (Procurement Executive). The Department's goal is to encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build confidence in the Government's acquisition system, and reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and other external forces. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party at the Contracting Officer level through open and frank discussions. If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency at a level above the Contracting Officer. b. DEFINITIONS: An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority but not both. When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the guidelines set forth in these established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102. A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Department is open. c.PROCEDURES: Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final decision for the Department. Protests shall be addressed to: Chief Financial Officer U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency-level Protest". The protester shall also provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the responsible contracting officer and a copy to the addressee indicated below: Office of the General Counsel General Law Office U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 (FAX Number 571-273-0099) 21

ii. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the protester agrees not to protest to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or any other external forums. If the protester has already filed with the GAO or other external forums, the procedures described here may not be used. a. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or time set for receipt of proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests must be filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester was given the opportunity to be debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two sentences, protests shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. b. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Amy protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered filed until all information is provided. c. To be complete, protests must contain the following information: 1. the protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number 2. the solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer 3. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced 4. copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statement 5. a request for ruling by the agency 6. Statement as to form of relief requested 7. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest 8. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest 9. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the Contracting Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the issues raised by the protester and addresses any other issues, which, even if not raised by the protester, have been identified by agency officials as being relevant to the fairness of the procurement process. For good cause shown, the protest decision authority may grant an extension of time for filing the administrative report and for issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will notify the protester and all interested parties within I day of the decision to grant the extension. Unless an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest decision authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of Commerce and not subject to further appeals. The protest decision authority shall send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by certified mail, return receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting office and Office of Acquisition Management. iii. Effect of protest on award and performance: When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that: a. The supplies or services are urgently required, b. delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly, or c. a prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government.

When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.506, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer shall immediately suspend performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including any review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance is justified. The HCA may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that: d. contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or e. urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision. d. REMEDIES: The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies: terminate the contract, re -compete the requirement, issue a new solicitation, refrain from exercising options under the contract, award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations, amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue with the procurement, vii. such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to correct a defect.
