     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

 

     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

 

     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

 

         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

 

         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

 

       (ii) Examples.

 

         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

 

         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

 

         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

 

         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

     (1) Listed end products.

     (2) __ Outside the United States.

       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

 

     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

 

       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

 

       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

 

   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR , the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of ; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 

The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see , Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through  or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

21. COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 508 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973, AS AMENDED (AUG 2011)

 

   In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.  794d) as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105 - 220), August 7, 1998 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities.  Inaccessible technology interferes with an ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, open new opportunities for people with disabilities, and encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals.  The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology.  Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to access available to others.

 

   Specifically, Section 508 of that Act requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use EIT, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

22. 52.212-2 EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

 

   (a) The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered. 



The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:

 

(1)	Factor 1 – WEBCAST CAPABILITY



The Government will evaluate the adequacy of offeror’s demonstrated webcasting capability to meet solicitation requirements on a pass/fail basis. The Government will subjectively evaluate the live webcasting demonstration(s) using their visual and auditory inspectiion and determine if the video and audio quality meets (passes or fails) solicitation requirements 



If the Government determines the offeror does not pass one or both of the live webcast capability demonstration(s), the Government may determine the Offeror’s overall proposal to be unacceptable and not further evaluate or consider the proposal.



(2)	Factor 2 – TECHNICAL APPROACH



The Government will evaluate the efficacy of the offeror’s proposed technical approach to meet solicitation requirements, including the extent to which the offered solution complies with the Section 508 standards specified in this solicitation and the adequacy of the draft IT Security Plan.



(3)	Factor 3 – Corporate Experience



The Government will evaluate the breadth and depth of the offeror’s demonstrated corporate experience and, if applicable, demonstrated experience of its subcontractors that are proposed to perform at least 25% of the labor cost/price for the potential total period performance of the contract.



(4) Factor 4 – Past Performance Information 



Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror’s ability to perform the contract successfully.  The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor’s performance will be considered.



The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Information of the offeror and/or its proposed significant subcontractor(s) to assess how well they performed on previous and current contracts within the past three (3) years similar in scope to this procurement. 



The Government will evaluate quality of services and products delivered, timeliness of performance, effectiveness of cost control (for non-firm-fixed-price contracts), ability to adhere to required schedule, and commitment to customer satisfaction.



The NRC may contact some or all of the referenced points of contact provided on the list of contracts submitted that are similar scope to this requirement, may query, and may review and consider past performance information on other contracts that it is aware of or that is obtained from any other source, as applicable.



In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not reasonably available, the Offeror would receive a neutral rating (neither favorable nor unfavorable) for past performance information.

  

(5) Factor 5 – Evaluated Cost/Price

 

The Government will consider the total offered cost/price and, for evaluation and award decision purposes, may make adjustments to any non-firm-fixed-price hours if the Government determines those proposed costs to be unrealistically low or high.



Factors (1), (2), (3) and (4), when combined, are approximately equal to factor (5) in importance.  Factors (3) and (4) are approximately equal in importance.



(b) After evaluating all proposals in accordance with (a), the contracting officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted.   Therefore, to limit the competitive range for purposes of efficiency, the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals ( and ). 



   (c) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

 

   (d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

    

23. EVALUATION OF OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (AUG 2011)

 

   As part of the price evaluation, the Government will evaluate the option to extend services under the clause at FAR 52.217-8 by adding six months of the Offeror's price for the last potential period of performance under this contract to the Offeror's total price.  For example, if the contract includes option periods that are exercisable under FAR 52.217-9, the Offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, all option periods, and an additional six months of the last option period. Offerors must price only the base and option periods specified in the contract line item numbers (CLINs), and shall not submit a price for the potential six-month extension of services under FAR 52.217-8.



24.  52.237-3  CONTINUITY OF SERVICES (JAN 1991)



(a) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, upon contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to— 

(1) Furnish phase-in training; and 

(2) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor. 

(b) The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer’s written notice, (1) furnish phase-in, phase-out services for up to 90 days after this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with a successor to determine the nature and extent of phase-in, phase-out services required. The plan shall specify a training program and a date for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer’s approval. The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the phase-in, phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency. 

(c) The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this contract. The Contractor also shall disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees. If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor. 

(d) The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the fee (profit) under this contract. 






ATTACHMENT A - PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



I.  BACKGROUND



The mission of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is to license and regulate the Nation's civilian use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and protect the environment. One of the primary goals of the NRC is to maintain openness in the regulatory process by facilitating open communication and promoting transparency to earn the trust of internal and external stakeholders. 



The NRC facilitates open communication and transparency by providing public access to information on NRC’s programs and activities in a variety of ways, including:



Announcing the schedule and topics of upcoming Commission public meetings in the Federal Register, so that anyone interested in each meeting’s subject may arrange to attend the meeting in person or monitor the meeting remotely;

Listing the schedule and topics of upcoming Commission public meetings, committee proceedings and administrative adjudicatory hearings on NRC’s public website with web links to background documents that would be helpful to the public in understanding the issue or action being discussed;

Providing public access to transcripts of NRC meetings, committee proceedings and administrative adjudicatory proceedings; and

Broadcasting NRC public meetings, committee proceedings and administrative adjudicatory hearings over the Internet “live” (during the actual meeting) and continuing to make them available for viewing afterwards as an “archived” version from the NRC streaming webpage, that all interested parties can conveniently access “on-demand”



Approximately one hundred fifty (150) Commission and Public meetings are conducted annually at the NRC’s White Flint Complex (WFC) and at offsite locations within the DC Metro area (delivered via VTC).  These webcasts are made available for live and/or archived viewing over the Internet.  



In addition, the NRC has held a separate contract for the webcasting and temporary (ninety [90] day) archiving of administrative adjudicatory proceedings held by the Commission’s Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel (ASLBP or the Panel).  The Commission and the Panel’s Chief Administrative Judge establish Licensing Boards to hear and adjudicate licensing and enforcement cases involving nuclear power plants and source materials (from mining to fabrication to use).  Historically ASLBP has enjoyed contractual access to twenty five (25) webcasting events lasting eight (8) to twelve (12) hours each.  The majority of these events have been broadcast from the WFC with the potential for some to be broadcast from remote locations within the United States.



 The NRC intends to increase the quantity and expand the location of meetings beyond the DC metropolitan area to include other NRC public meetings, committee proceedings and events that the NRC expects will have significant public interest.   






II. OBJECTIVE

 

The contractor shall provide the NRC with the following services:



A highly reliable, fully operational webcast infrastructure and webcasting supporting data communications service that captures the audio and video content of NRC’s public meetings, committee proceedings, adjudicatory hearings or events from designated NRC locations or offsite locations, encodes the content to prevent its alteration by unauthorized parties, transmits the content to the contractor's technical infrastructure, and is viewable through the Internet by the general public.



An external infrastructure (hosted outside NRC’s computer network firewall) that is accessible by any interested party via the Internet to view the NRC-provided content of the events.  This infrastructure shall make the webcast available for live and/or archived on-demand viewing to Internet viewers free of charge to them and without advertising.



A full-service remote webcast production solution for events which are held within the continental US, but beyond the DC metropolitan area.  This remote production solution may consist of providing camera, camera operator, video and audio recording services, webcast equipment, and data communication services to produce and send a live webcast from a remote site.



Accurate live captioning services and post-production captioning services to ensure that the NRC’s webpage, webcasts, and video comply with applicable standards identified in the solicitation for Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended (see ). 



Technical support from 6am-9pm each weekday (Eastern Time) to continuously monitor and optimize overall webcast solution performance, minimize solution downtime, diagnose and quickly correct any solution performance issues, maintain the webcast webpage content, advise NRC of the benefits of advancements in Media Streaming technology as they occur, and provide toll-free telephone access to assist viewers of NRC webcasts with questions or concerns related to accessing the NRC webcasts.



 III. SCOPE OF WORK



The contractor shall provide complete remote access to NRC Commission meetings, committee proceedings, adjudicatory hearings and other significant public meetings and events for live and/or archived on-demand viewing over the Internet as defined in this statement of work.  The contractor shall provide all facilities, equipment and services to meet contract requirements.



A.  Basic Services



All requirements stated herein that are not specifically listed as “As-Needed Services” below shall be considered “Basic Services.” 



The contractor shall provide any webcast and data communications support, services and equipment redundancy required to:
