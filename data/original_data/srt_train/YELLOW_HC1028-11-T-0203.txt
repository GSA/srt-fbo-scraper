2.  Contract Title

 Army Knowledge Online/Defense Knowledge Online (AKO/DKO) Autonomy Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)

3.  Background

The original AKO portal system began as a pilot in 1997.  Due to its success, the Secretary of the Army mandated that all Army data, information
and systems be migrated to the AKO Portal system.  The AKO architecture and portal system represented the first step in building the Army
intranet to provide Army personnel worldwide with access to job related and mission-oriented knowledge in real time.  AKO became DoD’s largest
and one of the most successful service portals, providing services to over 1.8 million Army users and sustaining over 300,000 logins daily.

Based upon the success of the AKO portal system other users desired to obtain similar services but within a new Defense Knowledge Online (DKO)
portal framework.  The AKO Project Management Office (PMO) began working with the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program at the Defense
Information Systems Agency (DISA).  DISA intended to design and build a Service-oriented Architecture Framework (SOAF) for the DoD.
Additionally, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) wanted to install their data operations on the AKO portal system.

As an interim solution, a competitive task order was awarded to Northrop Grumman (NG) on 05 March 2007.  DISA and Director of National
Intelligence (DNI) were the first portals that were incorporated into the AKO-Enterprise Services (ES) portal system.  The use of the portal
system has promoted joint communications efforts within and among DoD components.  AKO-ES is the only existing solution that provides DoD
enterprise messaging services that are independent of location and organization.

Since October 2007, the operation and maintenance of AKO-ES is executed at the current three sites: (1) Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, (2) Maryland and
(3) Southwest Asia.  The AKO/DKO PMO currently leases space at the Maryland site and all AKO/DKO hardware, software, and maintenance agreements
are Government-owned.  Now, AKO/DKO provides web based enterprise information services to over 2.5 million active duty and retired military
personnel and their families, civilian servants and contractor support throughout the world. Services included within the AKO intranet are
directory, portal, search, single-sign-on and email amongst others.

The search service within the AKO/DKO portal is an enterprise class content discovery engine that hosts over 13 million documents and serves
over 2.5 million users worldwide.  AKO/DKO Search utilizes the world class Autonomy Intelligent Data Operating Layer (IDOL) Server on the back
end, allowing for basic (keyword search, Boolean operators, parametric refinement, etc), and advanced functionality (conceptual matching,
automatic query guidance, clustering, education, personalized agents, etc).  AKO/DKO Search also provides a high availability enterprise class
web application as a user interface on the front end, providing visualizations for functionality like advanced search options, query refinement,
AKO Recommends, and conceptual suggestions.  AKO/DKO currently has 18 perpetual Autonomy IDOL server licenses and has reached capacity. A steep
trajectory of demand in search capability for the AKO/DKO portal is forecast and an enterprise license agreement is expected to yield a large
cost savings for the Government.

4.  Objectives

The objective of this effort is to secure a five (5) year enterprise license agreement (ELA) for an unlimited number of perpetual Autonomy IDOL
server licensing to manage the existing and anticipated future need for the Autonomy IDOL search capability.  In addition to the ELA for the
autonomy search server licenses, the Army AKO/DKO program office has a need for the associated 24x7 software maintenance support.

5.   Scope

   a. The Contractor shall provide unlimited, perpetual Autonomy IDOL server licenses for those products listed in Section 6 below.
        1) In order to keep pace with changes in technology and meet worldwide requirements of the Army, the Contractor shall provide for new
           technologies and refresh product offerings in accordance with the Contractor's commercial business practices.
   b. The Contractor shall provide 24x7 software maintenance support for all Autonomy IDOL server licenses and software packages listed in
      Section 6 below.

5.1      Maintenance Support for Year 4 and Year 5

Beyond the base Period the Government reserves the right to exercise options for software support maintenance.  Each option shall provide
maintenance for all Section 6 software products for a period of one (1) year, payable by the Government in arrears.  Software maintenance shall
be consistent with the software publisher's commercial terms, and shall include, free of charge to the Government, all commercially released
software applications, patches and upgrades and 24x7 telephone support.

6.  Requirements

6.1      Autonomy Software Licenses

Army AKO/DKO requires an ELA for Autonomy IDOL server licenses which provide search functionality for the AKO/DKO enterprise portal. The AKO/DKO
Program Office also requires unlimited user access to the web application search capability integrated into the AKO/DKO portal. The components
of the ELA are defined below. Additionally, the Contractor shall provide 24x7 software maintenance support services for the products listed
below in this effort.

defined in 5 Code of Federal Regulations, section 2635, Subpart D.  Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that such personnel
avoid such participation absent notice to, and approval by, the Contracting Officer.  To that end, Contractor agrees that its personnel to
include subcontractor personnel will, prior to the commencement of performance, sign and submit to the Government the Certificate of No Conflict
of Interest which will be provided by the Government at award.

         b. Identification of Non-Disclosure Requirements

In the course of performance pursuant to this contract, the contractor may access nonpublic information, including acquisition sensitive
information.  Contractor agrees that it will not use or disclose any such information unless authorized, in writing, by the Contracting Officer.
 Contractor further agrees that it will use its best efforts to ensure that its employees and others performing services under this contract
will not use or disclose any such information unless authorized by the Contracting Officer.  To that end, Contractor agrees that its employees
and others performing duties under this contract will, prior to the commencement of performance, sign the Certificate of Nondisclosure which
will be provided by the Government at award.

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

[List as necessary]

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA,
the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.
The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines
that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(1) Listed End Product
| Listed End Product                                |· Listed Countries of Origin:                       |

(2) Certification.  (If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then
the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.)

(  )(i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in
the corresponding country as listed for that product.

(  ) (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the

(  ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror (  ) does (  ) does not

the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for
the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(  ) (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror (  ) does (  ) does not certify that--

(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));

(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for
these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

(k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.    

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this
information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the
Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN

(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

(  ) TIN: --------------------.
