Introduction



The U. S. Railroad Retirement Board (“RRB”) is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and survivor benefits program for railroad employees and their families.  The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and 1974.  Its benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System.  The Railroad Retirement System is unique inasmuch as it is the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry.  The RRB also administers the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees.  The RRB’s headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois.    



Background



The RRB is required to create authentic and reliable records; provide adequate and proper documentation; and maintain systematic control of its electronic records according to the framework outlined in the Federal Records Act, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policies, and National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) regulations and guidance.  



The agency’s information system environment consist of mainframe and non-mainframe systems used to create, capture, process, store, and retrieve electronic content for various business processes using the following hardware/software technologies:



Mainframe System/Software



IBM System Z9

DB2 (Database Management System)



Document Imaging System



Dell Servers, Windows 2003 Server R2 Standard

Microsoft SQL 2003

Global 360 for providing basic imaging, workflow, and storage archive management capabilities



Non-Mainframe Systems/Applications



SharePoint Services WSS 2.0 (plans underway to upgrade to SharePoint 2010)

EMC OneSource Archive for migrating and storing emails files to a centralized electronic repository 

Microsoft 2010 Exchange Server

Microsoft Office Suite applications (e.g., Outlook Mail, Word Processing, and Spreadsheets)

Microsoft Project 2003

Microsoft Windows-based file servers



The Document Imaging System is an approved recordkeeping system for managing specific claims-related documentation.  Although our non-mainframe systems are efficient at creating, storing, and sharing electronic mail, word processing documents, and other types of electronic content, they are not adequate to serve as an approved Electronic Records and Content Management (ERCM) System in accordance with electronic records management functional requirements.  



Mandatory Compliance



The offeror’s products and services must be compliant with the following Federal laws and standards:



NARA regulation 36 CFR Part 1236, Electronic Records Management.

OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources.



Department of Defense (DoD) 5015.2 Electronic Records Management Software Application Design Criteria Standard version 3.



Objective



The RRB is seeking information from vendors about their ERCM solutions to help us formulate a phased strategy to establish controls over our records that is consistent with the agency' information system development lifecycle, budget, and procurement goals.



The rate at which electronic records are being created and the increasing difficulty of managing unstructured repositories containing electronic records, it is imperative the RRB plan and integrate practical records management at the enterprise level in order to manage risks to our electronic record assets.  



The offeror shall provide a descriptive narrative discussing how their proposed solution integrates with SharePoint, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange Server, and Document/Workflow Management, Web Management, and Social Media Management, at a minimum.  In addition, the offeror shall discuss how their solution declares and protect records throughout its lifecycle (creation, maintenance and use, and disposition), identifies records eligible for destruction or transfer, and allow for purge or transfer of eligible records from the system in accordance with approved retention policies.  Please provide a discussion how your system meets and/or exceeds the performance capabilities listed below:



Record Creation



Declare a Record



Allows records to be declared, captured, and classified manually or automatically.



Assigns a unique identifier to records and documents ownership identification and version control. 



Captures metadata manually or automatically and reliably links metadata to associated records.



Capture a Record



Allow import of physical records from internal or external environments into a centralized repository, which includes format conversions of records into open file formats.



Allows for creation of a link from the ERCM system to a record stored in an external repository to allow for in-place records management.



Maintenance and Use



Organize Records



Allow for configurable agency-specific scheme(s) for how records are organized.



Allows users to place restrictions on records to prevent their destruction (legal holds, on-hold, etc.,)



Execute disposition instructions, based on assigned permissions, to move a single or group of records from active to inactive status.

Maintain Records Security



Prevent declared records from being overwritten.



Prevent modifications to unique records identifiers once a record is declared.



Prevent deletion of indexes, metadata, categories, and other pointers to declared records.



Provide document version control and record locking to separate draft and protect final records. 



Adequate recovery procedures so that records may be restored following a system malfunction.



Manage Records Access



Permit the identification and set up of individual users and groups permissions to view, print, or edit retention policies, disposition schedules, and file plans.



Enforce access permissions and restrictions on all record retrievals.



Allows records to be redacted in the system and prevents reconstruction.



Protect redacted records, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), to ensure records are not accessible.



Facilitate Records Retrieval



Allow searching on enterprise search such as full text, metadata, subject category, single query, location, wild-card, and between versions of the same record.



Ensures all access privileges are enforced on all retrievals.



Preserve Records



Controls to protect the record’s reliability, authentic, integrity, usability, content, context, and structure.



Ensure records can be read and accurately interpreted throughout the system’s lifecycle.



Allow migration of records to new storage media and flexible format options to avoid loss due to media decay or technology obsolescence.



Captured metadata remains linked to declared records and are unaltered throughout record’s lifecycle.



Audit/Oversight



Audit capabilities documenting system access, records modifications, deletions, and record transfers. 



Restore/recovery of records following system malfunctions.



Storage capacity and utilization alerts from central or in-place record repositories.



Tracks and documents failed attempts of all records activity and system functions.



Prevents editing or deletion of audit logs.



Disposition/Destruction/Transfer of Records



Destruction



Identify records eligible to be destroyed based on retentions schedules and disposition instructions.



Delete records in a manner that they cannot be physically reconstructed or retrieved.



Enable a record to be kept of all destructions, providing certifiable proof of destruction.



Transfer



Identify records eligible for destruction/transfer.



Export record and associated metadata in formats acceptable for transfer to NARA to preserve the context and structure of the electronic record.



Allows records to be kept on all record destructions and providing certifiable proof of destruction.



Explain or demonstrate how the system performs the following features:



Out-of-the box records management functionality and modular options.



Suite system installable options and how solution integrates with SharePoint, Microsoft Office, Document Management, Microsoft Exchange, Web Management, and Social Media applications.



User and group permissions defaults and custom permission level options.



Records declaration options--number of steps to declare a record.



Records Management interface for creating record polices and assigning user permissions.



Specify whether the product is a central and/or federated system.



Information on deduplication features for managing emails and related attachments.



Look and feel of various user interfaces based on assigned permissions.



Software Measurement Tools embedded in the software to collect statistical information.



The RRB may request a demonstration of your offered ERCM solution.
