If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:00 p.m., local time, for the designated Battelle office on the date that proposal or revision is due. 2. Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Battelle office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Battelle Contracts Representative determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-A. If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or B. There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Battelle site designated for receipt of offers and was under Battelle's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or C. It is the only proposal received. 3. However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Battelle, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. A. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Battelle site includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Battelle personnel. B. If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Battelle processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Battelle requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Battelle processes resume. C. Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award.

submitted to the Battelle Contracts Representative and approved by Battelle before any of these employees begin work under this contract. F. The Contractor shall notify the Battelle Contracts Representative immediately of any OSHArecordable injuries/illnesses, any off-normal occurrences, or Government property damaged, that the Contractor determines to have occurred in the course of operations onsite and shall furnish such further information as the Battelle Contracts Representative may require. An off-normal occurrence is any unplanned or unexpected event, including near misses, or the discovery of a deficiency in a procedure, plan, or system that has real or potentially undesirable consequences to personnel, equipment, facilities, the environment, and/or programs. G. The Contractor`s onsite ES&H activities will be subject to review by the Technical Administrator of this contract. Other representatives of Battelle may conduct periodic inspections of the Contractor`s equipment, work and storage areas for compliance with the applicable ES&H requirements. The Battelle Contracts Representative will notify the Contractor by a written Notice of Non-compliance of any observed non-compliance with applicable ES&H requirements. The Contractor shall immediately take appropriate corrective action. The Contractor shall advise the Battelle Contracts Representative, in writing, within five (5) working days of the corrective action taken on any safety non-compliance noted on the written Notice of Non-compliance. If the Contractor fails or refuses to correct the safety non-compliance, Battelle may perform, or cause to be performed, the necessary corrective work and unilaterally charge the Contractor for the cost thereof. Such charges will be deducted from payments otherwise due the Contractor under this contract. H. The Contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any non-compliance with applicable ES&H requirements. If the Contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the Contractor`s acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an imminent danger to the environment, or health and safety of employees or the public, the Battelle Contracts Representative may issue an order stopping work in whole or in part and the Contractor shall be liable for the delay and any costs thereby incurred. Any stop-work order issued by Battelle under this clause (or issued by the Contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of Battelle. In the event that the Battelle Contracts Representative issues a stop-work order, an order authorizing the resumption of the work may be issued at the discretion of the Battelle Contracts Representative. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time, or additional cost or fee, or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage ordered in accordance with this clause. I.

3. No retaliation or retribution shall be taken toward any individual as a result of filing an employee concern consistent with 10 CFR 708. J. Civil Penalties and Indemnification 1. The 2002 Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act amended the Atomic Energy Act by adding section 234C Worker Health and Safety Rules for Department of Energy Nuclear Facilities. It required DOE to promulgate a worker safety and health rule, published in the Federal Register on February 9, 2006, as 10 CFR 851. It establishes worker safety and health requirements that govern the conduct of contractor activities at both nuclear and non-nuclear DOE Sites. Contractors that fail to comply with the Rule are subject to civil penalties or contract penalties.

2. The Contractor assumes full responsibility and shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Battelle, its directors, officers, and employees from any civil or contractual liability under section 234C of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the implementing regulations, arising out of the activities of the Contractor, its subcontractors, suppliers, agents, employees, and their officers, or directors. The Contractor`s obligation to indemnify and hold harmless shall expressly include attorney fees and other reasonable costs of defending any action or proceeding instituted under section 234C or DOE`s implementing regulations. K. The Contractor is responsible for its subcontractors` compliance with the ES&H requirements of this contract.

AUTHORIZED NEGOTIATORS If a negotiation meeting is held, the Offeror shall designate as its negotiator a person who is authorized to make legally binding commitments without further review or approval. If, for any reason, it is impractical for the Offeror to be represented at a negotiation meeting by other than a person fully authorized to act in its behalf, Battelle shall be notified sufficiently in advance to allow a decision to be made whether the negotiations should proceed as scheduled or be postponed. The Offeror's notice, if originally given orally, shall be confirmed in writing. CONTRACT AWARD a) Battelle may evaluate proposals received in response to this solicitation without discussion. Contract award, if any, will be made to the responsive, responsible offeror whose evaluated proposal will be most advantageous to Battelle, considering only price and any price-related factors specified elsewhere in the solicitation, or (b) Battelle may reject any or all proposals, and waive informalities or minor irregularities in proposals received, or (c) Battelle may accept any item or combination of items, unless doing so is precluded by a restrictive limitation in the solicitation or the proposal, or (d) Battelle may reject a proposal as non-responsive if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub-line items. A proposal is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than prices for some items and prices which are significantly overstated in relation to prices for other items, and if there is a reasonable doubt that the proposal will result in the lowest overall price to Battelle even though it may be the low evaluated proposal, or if it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment. (e) Funding is obligated for this action. However, contract award is subject to Availability of Funds at the time of award. We offer to sell the above items (or alternate items as specified) at the prices indicated, on the terms and conditions stated and the referenced general provisions which will be a part of any resulting order.

QDR Infiniband network specifications:

RFP 176583 June 10, 2010

1) Single QDR Infiniband switch fully populated/configured for 648 ports with no oversubscription. 2) The Infiniband fabric shall include a subnet manager and related software to monitor the fabric health and configure QoS and virtual lanes. 3) All cables required to connect the 304 compute nodes and the 5 ancillary nodes to the Infiniband switch. Network and Operational requirements: The compute cluster is expected to be operated as up to 4 distinct clusters segmented by Ethernet VLANs while sharing the same Infiniband fabric. The Ethernet network for the cluster shall be constructed so that individual nodes and/or racks can be segmented into distinct VLANs and each VLAN should support from 1 node up to the entire cluster. Rack level gigabit Ethernet switches shall be connected to a top level 10 Gigabit Ethernet switch. Rack level IPMI switches shall be connected to the top level IPMI switch by Gigabit Ethernet. The top level switches shall be large enough to support the expected growth and have a minimum of 24 ports.

The cluster shall be equipped with 5 ancillary nodes to handle distinct cluster segments and cluster management tasks. These nodes shall meet the same specifications as the compute nodes. In addition, each node will require a secondary Gigabit Ethernet port to connect to the PNNL research network. The ancillary nodes are in addition to the base 304 compute nodes.

Configured Rack: The cluster is expected to grow over time and to support this growth; we request a rack configuration that is ready to accept compute nodes. Growth will occur evenly on both sides of the Infiniband switch with up to 5 racks being added on either side. Each rack shall have: 1) Rack level network switches for both Ethernet and IPMI network 2) Appropriate cables to connect rack level switches to top level Ethernet and IPMI network. For the Ethernet network, this includes required optics on both the rack level and top level Ethernet switches 3) Appropriate fiber cables to connect 38 compute nodes to the Infiniband switch. Costs for a configured rack are expected to be variable depending on the distance from the central switch.

GPU node:

RFP 176583 June 10, 2010 1) Compute nodes as specified with the addition of an NVIDIA Tesla M2090 GPU board connected to a PCI Express 2.0 16x slot running at 16x.

Physical space requirements: The cluster shall occupy less than 12 cabinets in a single row of a raised floor data center and fit into a existing APC AR3100 racks each of which is fed by two Raritan PX- 5628I PDUs. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for a preferred rack layout assuming 1U servers. This layout assumes copper Infiniband cabling from the racks adjacent to the Infiniband switch cabinet. No more than two cabinets on either side of the Infiniband switch may use copper cables for Infiniband connectivity. All other cabinets shall use fiber optic cabling for Infiniband. All components shall draw air from the front of the cabinet and exhaust out the back. Maximum power draw for any one rack of computers shall not exceed 22kVA Cooling in the room will be provided by Motivair rear door heat exchangers (RDHx) and a sufficient amount of standard under the floor CRAC cooling. All cables shall be placed into existing overhead cable trays with separate trays for fiber and copper cabling. The distance from the top of the rack to the bottom of the copper cable tray is 6 inches and the distance from the top of the rack to the bottom of the fiber tray is 11 inches. See Figure 3

Warranty requirements: All items shall include a 3 year, next day replacement parts warranty service.
