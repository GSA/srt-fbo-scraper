    <title>Increase in gamma delta T cells in the blood of cattle persistently infected with Bovine Leukemia Virus following administration of recombinant bovine IFN-gamma.</title>
    <abstract>To examine the effect of recombinant bovine interferon-gamma (rbIFN-gamma) on cattle persistently infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), BLV-infected cattle were inoculated intraperitoneally with IFN-gamma. All cattle were febrile after inoculation with IFN-gamma and then recovered within 48 h. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were decreased for 2-3 days and then their numbers were recovered. The number of gammadelta T cells increased after the fever. In contrast, the number of IgM(+) lymphocytes remained low for about 1 week. Moreover, the numbers of syncytia produced by peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased and remained low compared to that before IFN-gamma administration. These results suggest that IFN-gamma induces the up-regulation of gammadelta T cells, decreases the number of IgM(+) lymphocytes and suppresses the growth of BLV in BLV-infected cattle in vivo.</abstract>

    <title>Efficacy of an anti-fertility vaccine based on mammalian gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH-I)--a historical comparison in male animals.</title>
    <abstract>A N-terminal modified gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH-I, tetanus toxoid-CHWSYGLRPG-NH2) conjugate was evaluated histologically in a number of male animal species (mice, dogs and sheep). The immunogen has previously been shown to be highly effective in rats, by suppressing both steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. However, cross-species efficacy of peptide vaccines is known to be highly variable. Therefore, a comparative evaluation of reproductive tissues from animals immunized against this immunogen adsorbed onto an alum-based adjuvant was made. The sheep and dogs were chosen, as use of anti-fertility vaccines in these species is important in farming and veterinary practice. Changes in testicular size were measured during the immunization period and the greatest alteration (attributed to gonadal atrophy) was observed in the rat. Following euthanasia, the testicular tissue was evaluated for spermatogenesis. The most susceptible species to GnRH-I ablation was the rat, which showed significant (P < 0.0001) arrest in spermatogenesis compared with untreated controls. Testicular sections taken from treated animals were completely devoid of spermatozoa or spermatids, in comparison with 94% of the untreated controls showing evidence of spermatogenesis. The immunized mice and rams also showed significant arrest (P < 0.0001). There was a 30-45% decrease in spermatogenesis and total azoospermia was not apparent. However, the least responsive were the dogs, which showed little significant variation compared to untreated animals and only a 5% decrease in activity. A comparison of the specific IgG response to GnRH-I indicated that in sheep and dogs the response was not maintained, unlike in rodents, suggesting that suppression of fertility may be due to differences in immune responses in different animal species.</abstract>

    <title>Phylogenetic studies of Mammillaria (Cactaceae)-insights from chloroplast sequence variation and hypothesis testing using the parametric bootstrap.</title>
    <abstract>The genus Mammillaria is likely the most species-rich and morphologically variable genus in the Cactaceae. There is doubt as to whether the genus is monophyletic, and past infrageneric treatments differ regarding generic circumscription. Phylogenetic questions about Mammillaria were addressed using chloroplast DNA sequence data from the rpl16 intron and the psbA-trnH intergenic spacer for 125 taxa (113 Mammillaria, 10 Coryphantha, Escobaria, Neolloydia, Pelecyphora, Ortegocactus, and two outgroup taxa from Ferocactus and Stenocactus). Parsimony analyses were conducted using various heuristic search strategies. Bayesian analyses were conducted using the F81 and F81 + I + G models of sequence evolution. Tree topologies from the parsimony and Bayesian analyses were largely congruent. Hypothesis testing was undertaken using the parametric bootstrap to test the monophyly of the genus and the taxonomic status of Mammillaria candida. Phylogenies derived from the parsimony and Bayesian analyses indicate that Mammillaria is not monophyletic and that the genus Mammilloydia (synonym Mammillaria) is embedded within a "core" group of Mammillaria species. Both these results were corroborated by the parametric bootstrap tests. The entire rpl16 intron was deleted from species in the Mammillaria crinita group.</abstract>

    <title>Genetic variation of introduced Hawaiian and native Costa Rican populations of an invasive tropical shrub, Clidemia hirta (Melastomataceae).</title>
    <abstract>Clidemia hirta is one of the most common woody invasive plants in mesic to wet forests in Hawaii, where it was introduced around 1940. The species is relatively uncommon by comparison in its native range of Central and South America and some Caribbean Islands. We examined genetic variation in allozymes of 20 C. hirta populations on four Hawaiian Islands to determine the introduction history. For comparison, we measured genetic variation in 20 native populations across Costa Rica. Mean levels of genetic variation in Hawaiian and Costa Rican populations were low compared to other woody or introduced plants (11.5-12.5% polymorphic loci, 2.05-2.50 alleles per polymorphic locus, and 0.045-0.063 expected heterozygosity). Most genetic diversity was held within rather than among populations in both areas (G(ST) = 0.120 and 0.271 in Hawaii and Costa Rica, respectively). Hawaiian populations had a high degree of genetic similarity, and no genetic differentiation was found among the four Hawaiian Islands sampled. These patterns of genetic variation in Hawaii suggest that no intraspecific hybridization of genotypes from different parts of the native range has occurred and that introductions to the different islands came from the same or similar source populations. The low levels of genetic diversity in parts of both the native and introduced ranges suggest that genetic variation is unrelated to invasiveness in C. hirta.</abstract>

    <title>The relationship between contracting and livestock waste pollution.</title>
    <abstract>This paper investigates factors and mechanisms that influence the relationship between contracting and animal waste pollution. The questions raised are whether contracting worsens livestock waste management problems and how to apportion the burden of regulation between the contracting parties in a socially optimal way. The paper shows that the potential linkages between contracting and animal waste depend on scale, specialization, and concentration of animal units, as well as on division of inputs and contract settlement rules. The long-run apportioning of an increase in costs of environmental compliance depends on the integrator's market power for grower services.</abstract>

    <title>Building entrepreneurial communities: The appropriate role of enterprise development activities.</title>
    <abstract>This article examines the concept of building entrepreneurial communities as a strategy for community economic development. It begins by attempting to define what is meant by the term "entrepreneurial community" and to clarify how economic developers go about trying to create such places - using activities known as the "enterprise development" to help entrepreneurs grow new business. The article then analyzes the current approach to enterprise development and explains why it is incapable of producing entrepreneurial communities. The authors conclude by calling for a systemic and transformational approach to enterprise development that can truly yield community-wide economic development.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper focuses on the interaction between social capital and entrepreneurship in Aboriginal communities in Canada. Using statistical and interview data from three First Nations communities in northern Ontario, I examine if and how bonding networks turn into tangible resources for business development. The paper also highlights ways in which community relationships hinder entrepreneurship and turn into barriers to economic development. The paper concludes with examples of how insight into the interaction between public policy and social networks can help understand the barriers and opportunities facing community developers in marginalized communities around the world.</abstract>

    <title>Cropping diversity along the U.S.-Canada border.</title>
    <abstract>Cropping diversity, measured by the Gini coefficient, showed neither the United States nor Canada dominated in diversity along their northern plains border during 1975-1999. While cropping was slightly more concentrated in Canada for about two-thirds of the period, dominant concentration occasionally switched between the two countries. The relative price of canola to wheat and American wheat acreage restrictions were important factors determining diversity. In the early 1990s, American farmers lagged Canadian farmers in adopting alternative crops, possibly due to incentives to maintain wheat base acreage. The decoupling of American subsidies in 1996 had not significantly affected cropping diversification through 1999.</abstract>

    <title>Iron, zinc, and copper concentrations in breast milk are independent of maternal mineral status.</title>
    <abstract>Background: Little is known about the regulation of iron, zinc, and copper in breast milk and the transport of these minerals across the mammary gland epithelium. Objective: The objective was to study associations between breast-milk concentrations of iron, zinc, and copper and maternal mineral status. Design: Milk samples from 191 Swedish and Honduran mothers were collected at 9 mo postpartum. Iron, zinc, and copper concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Blood samples from mothers were analyzed for plasma zinc and copper and 4 indexes of iron status: hemoglobin, plasma ferritin, soluble transferrin receptors, and zinc protoporphyrin. Complementary food energy (CFE) intake was used as an inverse proxy for breast-milk intake. Results: Mean (+/-SD) breast-milk concentrations of iron were lower in the Honduran than in the Swedish mothers (0.21 +/- 0.25 compared with 0.29 +/- 0.21 mg/L; P < 0.001), and mean breast-milk concentrations of zinc and copper were higher in the Honduran than in the Swedish mothers [0.70 +/- 0.18 compared with 0.46 +/- 0.26 mg/L (P < 0.001) and 0.16 +/- 0.21 compared with 0.12 +/- 0.22 mg/L (P = 0.001), respectively]. Milk iron was positively correlated with CFE intake (r = 0.24, P = 0.001) but was not significantly correlated with any iron-status variable. Milk zinc was negatively correlated with CFE intake (r = -0.24, P = 0.001) but was not significantly correlated with maternal plasma zinc. Milk copper was not significantly correlated with CFE intake or maternal plasma copper. Conclusions: Milk iron, zinc, and copper concentrations at 9 mo postpartum are not associated with maternal mineral status, which suggests active transport mechanisms in the mammary gland for all 3 minerals. Milk iron concentrations decrease and milk zinc concentrations increase during weaning.</abstract>

    <title>A prospective, partially randomized study of pregnancy outcomes and hematologic responses to oral and intramuscular iron treatment in moderately anemic pregnant women.</title>
    <abstract>Background: Daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy fails to reduce the prevalence of anemia. However, 2 or 3 intramuscular doses of iron given at monthly intervals were recently found to be effective. Objective: We compared the safety and efficacy in treating pregnancy anemia of 3 intramuscular doses of iron given at monthly intervals with those of daily oral iron supplementation. Design: In a prospective, partially randomized study, 148 pregnant women received daily oral doses of 100 mg elemental Fe and 500 microgram folic acid, and 106 pregnant women received 3 intramuscular doses of 250 mg elemental Fe as iron dextran at 1-mo intervals and oral doses of 5 mg folic acid twice weekly. One hundred women in each group completed the study. Changes in hemoglobin, iron indicators, pregnancy outcomes, and birth weight were compared between the 2 groups. Results: Hemoglobin and iron indicators improved significantly with both treatments. The increase in serum ferritin concentration after parenteral iron treatment was significantly higher than that after oral iron treatment. No significant differences between the 2 groups in pregnancy outcomes and birth weight were observed. Systemic side effects were more common in the parenteral iron group, whereas gastrointestinal side effects were more common in the oral iron group. Conclusions: The intramuscular administration of 3 doses of 250 mg. Fe at monthly intervals appears to have good compliance and efficacy and may be used in women who cannot tolerate oral administration of iron. However, intramuscular administration of iron is appropriate only in hospital settings well equipped to treat anaphylactic crises.</abstract>

    <title>Genetic Diversity and Horizontal Transfer of Genes Involved in Oxidation of Reduced Phosphorus Compounds by Alcaligenes faecalis WM2072.</title>
    <abstract>Enrichment was performed to isolate organisms that could utilize reduced phosphorus compounds as their sole phosphorus sources. One isolate that grew well with either hypophosphite or phosphite was identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis as a strain of Alcaligenes faecalis. The genes required for oxidation of hypophosphite and phosphite by this organism were identified by using transposon mutagenesis and include homologs of the ptxD and htxA genes of Pseudomonas stutzeri WM88, which encode an NAD-dependent phosphite dehydrogenase (PtxD) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent hypophosphite dioxygenase (HtxA). This organism also has the htxB, htxC, and htxD genes that comprise an ABC-type transporter, presumably for hypophosphite and phosphite transport. The role of these genes in reduced phosphorus metabolism was confirmed by analyzing the growth of mutants in which these genes were deleted. Sequencing data showed that htxA, htxB, htxC, and htxD are virtually identical to their homologs in P. stutzeri at the DNA level, indicating that horizontal gene transfer occurred. However, A. faecalis ptxD is very different from its P. stutzeri homolog and represents a new ptxD lineage. Therefore, this gene has ancient evolutionary roots in bacteria. These data suggest that there is strong evolutionary selection for the ability of microorganisms to oxidize hypophosphite and phosphite.</abstract>

    <title>Interactions between Oral Bacteria: Inhibition of Streptococcus mutans Bacteriocin Production by Streptococcus gordonii.</title>
    <abstract>Streptococcus mutans has been recognized as an important etiological agent in human dental caries. Some strains of S. mutans also produce bacteriocins. In this study, we sought to demonstrate that bacteriocin production by S. mutans strains GS5 and BM71 was mediated by quorum sensing, which is dependent on a competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) signaling system encoded by the com genes. We also demonstrated that interactions with some other oral streptococci interfered with S. mutans bacteriocin production both in broth and in biofilms. The inhibition of S. mutans bacteriocin production by oral bacteria was stronger in biofilms than in broth. Using transposon Tn916 mutagenesis, we identified a gene (sgc; named for Streptococcus gordonii challisin) responsible for the inhibition of S. mutans bacteriocin production by S. gordonii Challis. Interruption of the sgc gene in S. gordonii Challis resulted in attenuated inhibition of S. mutans bacteriocin production. The supernatant fluids from the sgc mutant did not inactivate the exogenous S. mutans CSP as did those from the parent strain Challis. S. gordonii Challis did not inactivate bacteriocin produced by S. mutans GS5. Because S. mutans uses quorum sensing to regulate virulence, strategies designed to interfere with these signaling systems may have broad applicability for biological control of this caries-causing organism.</abstract>

    <title>The Crystal Structure of Archaeal Nascent Polypeptide-associated Complex (NAC) Reveals a Unique Fold and the Presence of a Ubiquitin-associated Domain.</title>
    <abstract>Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) was identified in eukaryotes as the first cytosolic factor that contacts the nascent polypeptide chain emerging from the ribosome. NAC is highly conserved from yeast to humans. Mutations in NAC cause severe embryonically lethal phenotypes in mice, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans. NAC was suggested to protect the nascent chain from inappropriate early interactions with cytosolic factors. Eukaryotic NAC is a heterodimer with two subunits sharing substantial homology with each other. All sequenced archaebacterial genomes exhibit only one gene homologous to the NAC subunits. Here we present the first archaebacterial NAC homolog. It forms a homodimer, and as eukaryotic NAC it is associated with ribosomes and contacts the emerging nascent chain on the ribosome. We present the first crystal structure of a NAC protein revealing two structural features: (i) a novel unique protein fold that mediates dimerization of the complex, and (ii) a ubiquitin-associated domain that suggests a yet unidentified role for NAC in the cellular protein quality control system via the ubiquitination pathway. Based on the presented structure we propose a model for the eukaryotic heterodimeric NAC domain.</abstract>

    <title>[gamma]-Protocadherins, Presenilin-mediated Release of C-terminal Fragment Promotes Locus Expression.</title>
    <abstract>[gamma]-Protocadherins ([gamma]-pcdhs) are type I membrane-spanning glycoproteins, widely expressed in the mammal and required for survival. These cell adhesion molecules are expressed from a complex locus comprising 22 functional variable exons arranged in tandem, each encoding extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular sequence, and three exons for an invariant C-terminal domain ([gamma]-ICD). However, the signaling mechanisms that lie downstream of [gamma]-pcdhs have not been elucidated. Here we report that [gamma]-pcdhs are subject to presenilin-dependent intramembrane cleavage (PS-IP), accompanied by shedding of the extracellular domain. The cleaved intracellular domain ([gamma]-ICD) translocates to the cell nucleus and was detected in subsets of cortical neurons. Notably, gene-targeted mice lacking functional [gamma]-ICD sequence showed severely reduced [gamma]-pcdh mRNA levels and neonatal lethality. Most importantly, inhibition of [gamma]-secretase decreased [gamma]-pcdh locus expression. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that [gamma]-pcdh promoter activity is increased by [gamma]-ICD. These results reveal an intracellular signaling mechanism for [gamma]-pcdhs and identify a novel vital target for the [gamma]-secretase complex.</abstract>

    <title>The Genome of the Basidiomycetous Yeast and Human Pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans.</title>
    <abstract>Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycetous yeast ubiquitous in the environment, a model for fungal pathogenesis, and an opportunistic human pathogen of global importance. We have sequenced its [approximately]20-megabase genome, which contains [approximately]6500 intron-rich gene structures and encodes a transcriptome abundant in alternatively spliced and antisense messages. The genome is rich in transposons, many of which cluster at candidate centromeric regions. The presence of these transposons may drive karyotype instability and phenotypic variation. C. neoformans encodes unique genes that may contribute to its unusual virulence properties, and comparison of two phenotypically distinct strains reveals variation in gene content in addition to sequence polymorphisms between the genomes.</abstract>

    <abstract>We use a method based on a statistical geomagnetic field model to recognize and correct for inclination error in sedimentary rocks from early Mesozoic rift basins in North America, Greenland, and Europe. The congruence of the corrected sedimentary results and independent data from igneous rocks on a regional scale indicates that a geocentric axial dipole field operated in the Late Triassic. The corrected paleolatitudes indicate a faster poleward drift of [approximately]0.6 degrees per million years for this part of Pangea and suggest that the equatorial humid belt in the Late Triassic was about as wide as it is today.</abstract>

    <abstract>Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and effectivenessof behavioral goal choices in the self-management of diabetes and to testgoal-setting theory hypotheses that self-selection and behavioral specificityof goals are key to enhancing persistence. Methods Participants with type 2 diabetes in a randomized controlled trial (n =422) completed baseline behavioral assessments using a clinic-based,interactive, self-management CD-ROM that allowed them to select a behavioralgoal and receive mail and telephone support for the initial 6 months of thetrial followed by additional behavioral assessments. Frequency of behavioralgoal selection and 6-month behavioral data were collected. Results Approximately 49%, 27%, and 24% of the participants, respectively, setgoals to increase physical activity (PA), reduce fat intake, or increasefruits and vegetables (F&V) consumed. At baseline, participants whoselected PA, reduced fat consumption, or F&V were significantly, andrespectively, less active, consumed more dietary fat, and ate fewer F&Vregardless of demographic characteristics. Participants who selected areduced-fat goal showed a significantly larger decrease than did those thatselected PA or F&V goals. Participants who selected an F&V goal showedsignificant changes in F&V consumption. Participants who selected a PAgoal demon-strated significant changes in days of moderate and vigorousphysical activity. Conclusions When participants are provided with information on health behavior statusand an option of behavioral goals for managing type 2 diabetes, they willselect personally appropriate goals, resulting in significant behavioralchanges over a 6-month period.</abstract>

    <abstract>Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the status of diabetes medical careand self-management among adult Puerto Ricans in New York City. Methods A random-digit-dialing telephone survey with a dual-frame sampling designwas employed to obtain a probability sample of adult Puerto Ricans withdiagnosed diabetes (n = 606). Demographic characteristics, health status, andindicators of diabetes medical care and self-management were collected usingthe standard Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire.A statewide sample of adults with diagnosed diabetes (n = 232) was obtainedfrom the BRFSS for comparison. Results Compared to New York State adults, Puerto Ricans were significantly lesslikely to receive annual A1C testing (72.7% vs 84.9%), cholesterol testing(67.5% vs 87.2%), blood-pressure-lowering medication (82.4% vs 91.9%), andpneumococcal vaccination (19.3% vs 28.5%, among those aged 18 to 64 years).Puerto Ricans were also less likely to take aspirin every day or every otherday to prevent cardiovascular complications (30.6% vs 40.7%). Puerto Ricanswere younger and more likely to have lower educational attainment and lowerincome than New York State adults, but they were not significantlydisadvantaged in access to health care indicated by ratesof health insurancecoverage, having a particular place for medical care, and frequencies ofseeing a provider for diabetes. Conclusions These findings support the need to introduce culturally sensitive andlinguistically appropriate diabetes education programs for Puerto Ricans andcontinue system-based diabetes care quality improvement efforts in the areasof prevention and control of cardiovascular complications, adult immunization,and A1C testing.</abstract>

    <title>Relationship of Campylobacter isolated from poultry and from darkling beetles in New Zealand</title>
    <abstract>Campylobacter, a foodborne pathogen closely associated with poultry, is considered to be an important agent of human gastroenteritis in New Zealand. The pathways involved in the contamination of poultry flocks remain unclear; however, many vectors, such as insects, rodents, and wild birds, have been implicated. Infestation of poultry houses by insects, particularly darkling beetles (Alphitobius diaperinus), is difficult to control. Furthermore, darkling beetles are known vectors for a variety of pathogens that include Salmonella, infectious bursal disease virus, Aspergillus, Escherichia coli, and Marek’s disease virus. In this investigation, the relationship between darkling beetles and Campylobacter contamination of poultry flocks was investigated. A New Zealand breeder flock and four of its progeny broiler flocks were included in the study. Samples of beetles and of intestinal excreta of the birds were cultured for the presence of Campylobacter spp. A subset of the recovered isolates was subsequently genotyped using flaA short variable region (SVR) DNA sequence analysis. A large number of Campylobacter subtypes were isolated, indicating that Campylobacter colonization of poultry is likely to arise from a number of different reservoirs. However, a set of genetically distinct isolates were found to be common to the broiler flocks and to the beetles. This research provides data that indicates that Alphitobius diaperinus may serve as a source of Campylobacter contamination of poultry. A more thorough understanding of the relationship between beetle infestation and the Campylobacter status of poultry flocks should enable progress in further development of biosecurity control measures.</abstract>

    <title>Detection of airborne Salmonella enteritidis in the environment of experimentally infected laying hens by an electrostatic sampling device</title>
    <abstract>Bacteriologic culturing of environmental samples taken from sources such as manure pits and egg belts has been the principal screening tool in programs for identifying commercial laying flocks that have been exposed to Salmonella enteritidis and are thus at risk to produce contaminated eggs. Because airborne dust and aerosols can carry bacteria, air sampling offers a potentially efficient and inexpensive alternative for detecting S. enteritidis in poultry house environments. In the present study, an electrostatic air sampling device was applied to detect S. enteritidis in a room containing experimentally infected, caged laying hens. After oral inoculation of hens with a phage type 13a S. enteritidis strain, air samples were collected onto agar plates with the electrostatic sampling device, an impaction air sampler, and by passive exposure to the settling of aerosols and dust. Even though the floor of the room was cleaned once per week (removing most manure, dust, and feathers), air samples were positive for S. enteritidis for up to 4 wk postinoculation. On the basis of both the number of S. enteritidis colonies observed on incubated agar plates and the frequency of positive results, the efficiency of the electrostatic device was significantly greater than that of the passive exposure plates (especially at short collection intervals) and was similar to that of the far more expensive impaction sampler. The electrostatic device, used for a 3-hr sampling interval, detected airborne S. enteritidis on 75% of agar plates over the 4 wk of the study.</abstract>

    <title>Fertility affects susceptibility of chrysanthemum to cotton aphids: influence on plant growth, photosynthesis, ethylene evolution, and herbivore abundance.</title>
    <abstract>This research details the influence of fertility on plant growth, photosynthesis, ethylene evolution and herbivore abundance of chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora Tzvelev 'Charm') inoculated with cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii Glover). We tested five fertility levels that consisted of 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% (375 ppm N) of recommended nitrogen levels. Aphid abundance was greatest at high fertility. Fertility affected the vertical distribution of aphids. A higher population of aphids were observed in physiologically mature and older leaves at low fertility, whereas at high fertility young leaves had 33% more aphids than older, basal leaves. Aphids depressed plant vegetative and reproductive growth, and altered carbohydrate partitioning at high fertility. Aphid-inoculated (AI) plants at high fertility had increased specific leaf area (SLA), i.e., thinner leaves and greater leaf area than aphid-free (NonAI) plants. Aphids caused greater ethylene production in reproductive buds and young leaves of high fertility plants, but had no effect on ethylene evolution in physiologically mature or older, basal leaves. Plant growth, leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) increased at higher fertility, as did chlorophyll and photosynthetic rates. Leaf N was highest in young and physiologically mature leaves compared to basal leaves. Aphids decreased leaf N and P. Aphids reduced photosynthesis in young leaves of high fertility plants, whereas physiologically mature and older leaves were unaffected.</abstract>

    <title>Environmental regulation of a 25 kDa dehydrin in relation to Rhododendron cold acclimation.</title>
    <abstract>The influence of photoperiod and temperature on the seasonal (fall to winter) cold acclimation and accumulation of a 25 kDa dehydrin in Rhododendron 'Chionoides' was studied by exposing two groups of plants each in the greenhouse or outdoors to either a natural photoperiod (or short days) or an extended photoperiod (or long days) regime. Results suggest that the shortening daylength alone is sufficient to trigger both the first stage of cold acclimation and concomitant 25 kDa dehydrin induction. Exposure of the plants to natural photoperiod and temperatures induced the greatest cold hardiness and 25 kDa accumulation, while exposure to extended photoperiods (long days) and warmer temperatures (in the greenhouse) failed to induce any significant freezing tolerance in leaves. Whereas short days trigger the cold acclimation process initially, low inductive temperatures can eventually replace the photoperiod stimulus. Seasonal accumulation of 25 kDa dehydrin, on the other hand, appears to be predominantly effected by short photoperiods. Data indicated that the leaf water content of outdoor plants maintained under natural photoperiod was lower than that of plants grown under extended photoperiod. This was also true for the greenhouse plants at the first (September) and the last (January) sampling. It is hypothesized that early 25 kDa dehydrin accumulation may be due to short-day-induced cellular dehydration. Accumulation of two other dehydrins of 26 kDa and 32 kDa molecular masses does not appear to be associated with short day (SD)-induced first stage of cold acclimation. Results show that their accumulation may be regulated by low, subfreezing temperatures and may be associated with the second and/or third stage of cold acclimation of 'Chionoides' rhododendron leaves.</abstract>

    <title>The more food young adults are served, the more they overeat.</title>
    <abstract>Young and Nestle suggested that the increase in the portion size of food products evident in the United States during the past 20 years may be responsible for the epidemic of overweight and obesity. They based their conclusion on statistical correlations. The purpose of the present study was to provide experimental evidence to support their proposal. Cornell undergraduate students were given access to a buffet lunch on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and were told this was a test of flavor enhancers. They were instructed to eat as much or as little as they wanted. On the same days of the following week, the subjects were divided into 3 groups. Each group was served either 100%, 125%, or 150% of the amount of food they had consumed the previous week. When larger amounts were served, significantly greater amounts of food were consumed. Each of the 4 foods that comprised the meal (soup, pasta, breadsticks, ice cream) increased significantly in proportion to the portion size. The data clearly support the hypothesis proposed by Young and Nestle and support the powerful role that environment plays in determining energy intake and potential increases in body weight.</abstract>

    <title>Dietary factors are not associated with high levels of obesity in New Zealand Pacific preschool children.</title>
    <abstract>Pacific children living in New Zealand (NZ) are prone to excessive weight gain. In this study, we assessed the anthropometric status of 2- to 5-y-old Pacific children (n = 60) in relation to their macronutrient intakes. Measurements of height (n = 56), weight (n = 60), midarm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness (n = 58), and 2-d weighed food records (n = 60) and demographic data were collected. Z-score results (mean +/- SD) showed that these children were tall (0.61 +/- 1.1) and heavy (1.67 +/- 1.1) for their age, and had high arm-muscle-area-for-height (geometric mean, 2.05). Over 64 and 45% of children were classified as overweight (including obesity) and obese, respectively. The percentage of energy contributed by fat in their diets met recommendations. In contrast, the percentage of energy contributed by sugar was high. The macronutrient intakes of children classified as obese (n = 32) compared with non-obese (n = 24) did not differ; however, their adjusted energy intakes were higher [5.79 (1.4) vs. 4.97 (1.4) MJ/d; P = 0.01]. Overweight and obesity were very common among very young NZ Pacific children, although the dietary etiology was not elucidated. These results emphasize the urgent need for obesity prevention for NZ Pacific children that begins early in life to avoid a future public health crisis.</abstract>

    <title>Utilization of beef from different cattle phenotypes to produce a guaranteed tender beef product.</title>
    <abstract>Cattle (n = 303) were visually selected from four feed yards to represent six phenotypes (English [EN; n = 50], 3/4 English-1/4 Brahman [ENB; n = 52], 1/2 English-1/2 Exotic [ENEX; n = 56], 1/2 English-1/4 Exotic-1/4 Brahman [ENEXB; n = 47], 3/4 Exotic-1/4 Brahman [EXB; n = 49], and 1/2 Exotic-1/4 English-1/4 Brahman [EXENB; n = 49]). Carcasses were processed at a commercial beef packing facility, and strip loins were collected after 48-h chilling. Strip loins were aged for 14 d at 2 degrees C and frozen at -20 degrees C for 3 to 5 d before three 2.5-cm-thick steaks were cut for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) determinations and sensory evaluations. Phenotype EN had the highest (P < 0.05) adjusted fat thickness, and EXB had adjusted fat thickness that was lower (P < 0.05) than all other phenotypes except EXENB. Carcasses of EN and ENB had smaller (P < 0.05) longissimus muscle areas than phenotypes ENEX, EXB, and EXENB. Phenotype EN produced carcasses with the highest (P < 0.05) numerical yield grade, whereas carcasses originating from phenotype EXB had lower (P < 0.05) numerical yield grades than all other phenotypes except ENEX. No differences (P > 0.05) were found among phenotypes for mean WBSF values or sensory panel ratings for initial and sustained tenderness, initial and sustained juiciness, beef flavor characteristics, and overall mouthfeel. More than 90% of steaks from carcasses of all phenotypes had WBSF values less than 3.6 kg when cooked to an internal cooked temperature of 70 degrees C. Results from this study indicated that all phenotypes represented in this study could be managed to produce tender beef.</abstract>

    <title>Free-range rearing of pigs during the winter: Adaptations in muscle fiber characteristics and effects on adipose tissue composition and meat quality traits.</title>
    <abstract>This research aimed to determine whether outdoor free-range rearing during the winter (average ambient temperature of 5 degrees C) vs. indoor housing (22 degrees C) affects meat quality, muscle metabolic traits, and muscle fiber characteristics. Forty Large White gilts and barrows were blocked by weight within each gender (20 per gender) and allotted randomly into two groups of pigs, with one reared indoors (IN) in individual pens (2.6 m2) and the other reared outdoors (OUT) from December to March in a 0.92-ha pasture. Both groups had free access to the same grower-finisher diet from 23 to 105 kg. At slaughter, adipose (backfat [BF] and omental fat [OF]) and muscle tissues (longissimus muscle [LM], rectus femoris [RF], and semitendinosus [ST]) were obtained from the right side of each carcass. Muscle fibers were stained and classified on the basis of stain reaction as slow-oxidative (SO), fast oxidative-glycolytic (FOG), and fast glycolytic (FG); fiber area and distribution were determined. Also assessed were carcass characteristics, initial and ultimate pH, L*a*b* values, drip loss percent, glycolytic potential (GP), and intramuscular lipid content, as well as the fatty acid profile of each muscle and adipose tissue. The OUT pigs had lower (P < 0.05) ADG and leaner (P < 0.05) carcasses than IN pigs. Rearing environment did not (P > 0.63) affect the intramuscular lipid content of the ST, but intramuscular lipid content was lower (P < 0.01) in the LM and tended to be higher (P = 0.06) in the RF of OUT than in those of IN pigs. In the BF outer layer of the OUT pigs, the higher PUFA content was compensated by both a lower (P < 0.01) saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) content, whereas in the OF, LM, and dark portion of the ST, only the percentage of MUFA was decreased (P < 0.01). In all tissues of the OUT pigs, the linolenic acid content was higher (P < 0.01) and the n-6:n-3 ratio was lower (P < 0.01). The GP of all muscles was higher (P < 0.01), and the ultimate pH of the RF and ST was lower (P < 0.01), in OUT compared with IN pigs. Lightness (L*) values were lower (P < 0.01) in the LM. Percentages of drip loss were higher (P < 0.05) in the LM and light portion of the ST of OUT than in those of IN pigs. The LM and RF of OUT pigs had more (P < 0.01) FOG and fewer (P < 0.01) FG fibers than muscles of IN pigs. Results suggest that rearing pigs outdoors increases aerobic capacity of glycolytic muscles but has little concomitant influence on meat quality traits.</abstract>

    <title>Study of calcium ion diffusion in components of maize kernels during traditional nixtamalization process.</title>
    <abstract>Our report shows the calcium ion diffusion process through the different parts of maize kernels (pericarp, endosperm, and germ) during the traditional nixtamalization process as a function of steeping time (t) 0-24 hr. The cooking step of the nixtamalization process used 3 kg of maize kernels in 6L of water and 2% calcium hydroxide (w/w). The cooking temperature was 92 degrees C for 40 min. The calcium content of the samples was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. We found that the whole instant corn flour, pericarp, endosperm, and germ, had a nonlinear relationship to steeping time, showing a local maximum at 9 hr. Analysis of the different parts of the nixtamalized kernels showed that in short steeping times (0-5 hr) calcium diffusion took place mainly in the pericarp. Calcium diffusion in the endosperm and germ occurred gradually over longer steeping times. However, the physical state of the kernels (broken kernels) accelerated the diffusion process. Calcium diffusion occurred first in the pericarp, followed by the endosperm and germ. Immediately after cooking (t = 0 hr), we found a 1.148% calcium content in the pericarp, 0.007% in the germ, and 0.028% in the endosperm. After 24 hr of steeping, the calcium contents were 2.714% in the pericarp, 0.776% in the germ, and 0.181% in the endosperm. In another study, the calcium content in the endosperm was measured by first separating the 10% from the outermost, followed by another 10% from the next endosperm tissue, and concluding with the remaining 80%. Calcium ions were present mainly in the outermost layers of the endosperm. The damaged kernels steeped for more than 5 hr showed greater calcium concentrations than the undamaged counterparts.</abstract>

    <title>Degradation of HMW glutenins during wheat sourdough fermentations.</title>
    <abstract>Bakeries use sourdoughs to improve bread properties such as flavor and shelf life. The degradation of gluten proteins during fermentation may, however, crucially alter the gluten network formation. We observed changes that occurred in the HMW glutenins during wheat sourdough fermentations. As fermentation starters, we used either rye sourdough or pure cultures of lactobacilli and yeast. In addition, we incubated wheat flour (WF) in the presence of antibiotics under different pH conditions. The proteolytic activities of cereal and sourdough-derived proteinases were studied with edestin and casein. During sourdough fermentations, most of the highly polymerized HMW glutenins degraded. A new area of alcohol-soluble proteins (approximately equal to 30.000 MW) appeared as a result of the proteolytic breakdown of gluten proteins. Very similar changes were observable as WF was incubated in the presence of antibiotics at pH 3.7. Cereal and sourdough-derived proteinases hydrolyzed edestin at pH 3.5 but showed no activity at pH 5.5. An aspartic proteinase inhibitor (pepstatin A) arrested 88-100% of the activities of sourdough enzymes. According to these results, the most active proteinases in wheat sourdoughs were the cereal aspartic proteinases. Acidic conditions present in sourdoughs create an ideal environment for cereal aspartic proteinases to be active against gluten proteins.</abstract>

    <title>Algorithms for calculating methane and nitrous oxide emissions from manure management.</title>
    <abstract>Biogenic emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from animal manure are stimulated by the degradation of volatile solids (VS) which serves as an energy source and a sink for atmospheric oxygen. Algorithms are presented which link carbon and nitrogen turnover in a dynamic prediction of CH4 and N2O emissions during handling and use of liquid manure (slurry). A sub-model for CH4 emissions during storage relates CH4 emissions to VS, temperature and storage time, and estimates the reduction in VS. A second sub-model estimates N2O emissions from field-applied slurry as a function of VS, slurry N and soil water potential, but emissions are estimated using emission factors. The model indicated that daily flushing of slurry from cattle houses would reduce total annual CH4 + N2O emissions by 35% (CO2 eq.), and that cooling of pig slurry in-house would reduce total annual CH4 + N2O emissions by 21% (CO2 eq.). Anaerobic digestion of slurry and organic waste produces CH4 at the expense of VS. Accordingly, the model predicted a 90% reduction of CH4 emissions from outside stores with digested slurry, and a > 50% reduction of N2O emissions after spring application of digested as opposed to untreated slurry. The sensitivity of the model towards storage temperature and soil water potential was examined. This study indicates that simple algorithms to account for ambient climatic conditions may significantly improve the prediction of CH4 and N2O emissions from animal manure.</abstract>

    <title>Pig slurry versus mineral fertilization on corn yield and nitrate leaching in a Mediterranean irrigated environment.</title>
    <abstract>Over the last 20 years, in many regions of Spain, there has been an intensification of pig production. Most of the resulting pig slurry (PS) is applied to agricultural fields and so it is important to determine the availability of nitrogen for the crops and to assess the risk of adverse environmental effects such as nitrate leaching. The effects of a single application of three different doses of PS: 50, 100 and 150 m3 ha(-1), were compared with a control mineral treatment in an irrigated Mediterranean environment. Development and crop yield of corn and the amount of nitrate leached were evaluated during 3 years in a Typic Xerofluvent soil. No significant differences for aboveground biomass, corn yield and nitrogen plant uptake were observed between the different fertilization schemes. Nitrate concentrations in the soil solution at the 0.9-1.2 m depth were higher for the control treatment (44.7 mg NO3(-)-N l(-1)) than for the slurry treatments (ranging from 19.9 to 28.0 mg NO3(-)-N l(-1)), indicating a higher susceptibility to nitrate leaching for the control mineral treatment. The high unaccounted losses in the N budget for the slurry treatments and the unexpectedly decrease in the ratio between nitrate leaching and applied nitrogen with increased N doses proves that there is a need to examine the slurry N cycle in the soils with especial emphasis in the immobilization of ammonium slurry in Mediterranean conditions.</abstract>

    <title>A soil and terrain digital database (SOTER) for improved land use planning in Central Benin.</title>
    <abstract>The soil is a natural resource, non-renewable in the short term and expensive either to reclaim or to improve following erosion or degradation. In the Republic of Benin (West Africa) the increasing pressure on land caused by steady population growth induces soil degradation. The reduced site productivity calls for an information system on soil resources, which allows the analysis of land suitability, potential food production, environmental impact of land use and the identification of conservation measures. On the basis of such a system, sound policy formulation and development planning at all levels can be carried out, utilizing both internal and external resources efficiently. For the central part of Benin, the development of a soil information system has been initiated. The data structure for the description of the land resources was established according to the Soil and Terrain Digital Database (SOTER) manual (Global and National Soils and Terrain Digital Databases (SOTER). Procedures Manual. International Soil Reference and Information Centre, Wageningen, The Netherlands, 1993) with slight modifications (Mitteilg. Dtsch. Bodenkdl. Ges. 76 (1995) 1221). Based on field observations and data analysis, land areas have been delineated showing similar response to management practices. On the uppermost level, seven so called 'terrain units' could be distinguished. The main differentiating criteria were landscape morphology, geology and hydromorphy. The terrain units are subdivided at a second level into 25 terrain components according to the soil parent material and landform. The FAO/ITC land suitability procedure was used to identify crop specific constraints to the production of sorghum, cowpea, maize, cotton, groundnuts and cassava. With regard to the soil induced limitations to crop production, unfavorable textural properties prevail, except for terrain components on gabbro or basaltic parent material. Unfavorable climatic conditions determine the suitability of this region for cotton, maize and cassava production. The ranking of the physical suitability of the six crops for Central Benin was in the order sorghum>groundnut>cowpea, cassava>maize>cotton. The problem of interannual variability of precipitation and its effects on the climatic suitability is discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Pectin esterase gene family in strawberry fruit: study of FaPE1, a ripening-specific isoform.</title>
    <abstract>Pectin esterases (PE, EC 3.1.1.11) catalyse the demethylation of pectin. As a result of its activity, structural interactions among cell wall components during cell wall turnover and loosening are affected. In plants, PEs are typically encoded by a gene family. This family has been studied in strawberry (Fragariaxananassa Duch.) in order to investigate the role of distinct PE genes during fruit ripening and senescence. By a combination of a PCR-based library screening and RT-PCR four different strawberry PE cDNAs, termed FaPE1 to FaPE4, have been isolated. Differential expression of each FaPE gene in various organs and during fruit development was revealed by northern blot. FaPE1 is specifically expressed in fruit, showing an increasing expression during the ripening process up to a maximum in the turning stage. Concerning hormone regulation, auxin treatment increased FaPE1 mRNA levels in green fruit, whereas exogenous ethylene decreased FaPE1 mRNA levels in ripe and senescing fruits. It is proposed that this repression of FaPE1 expression could be involved in textural changes occurring during fruit senescence.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of a PAL inhibitor on phenolic accumulation and UV-B tolerance in Spirodela intermedia (Koch.).</title>
    <abstract>Duckweed (Spirodela intermedia) was grown axenically on 1/2 strength Hutner's nutrient solution plus 1% sucrose, with the L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) inhibitor 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid (AIP) at 0.0, 0.05, or 10 μM, at constant 25 °C and a light intensity of 300 μmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation from CW fluorescent lamps. Growth with 10 μM AIP led to decreased frond area and fresh weight, but dry weight was unchanged. Microscopic examination of fronds revealed increased frond thickness and a lack of reticulate aerenchyma. Ultraviolet epifluorescence microscopy and UV-Vis spectroscopy of methanolic extracts confirmed the dose-dependent inhibition of secondary phenolic synthesis with the near total elimination of secondary phenolic accumulation at the 10 μM level. AIP-treated plants showed increased sensitivity to UV-B as shown by a reduced F(v)/F(m). The results provided direct evidence of the working hypothesis that phenols function to screen UV radiation from reaching photosynthetic tissues or damaging other sensitive tissues. A novel histochemical method employing zirconyl chloride to visualize phenols is discussed.</abstract>

    <title>An ecological approach to study the physical and chemical effects of rye cover crop residues on Amaranthus retroflexus, Echinochloa crus-galli and maize.</title>
    <abstract>Weeds can be suppressed in the field by cover crop residues, extracts of which have been demonstrated to exert chemical inhibition of crop and weed germination and early growth in bioassays. In this study, two complementary bioassays were developed with soil and mulch material originating from a long-term maize-cover crop experiment to determine the relative physical and chemical effect of rye cover crop residues on weed and maize germination and early growth. This was compared with the effect exerted by residue material from the natural vegetation that developed in the crop stubble during the winter before maize sowing. Germination percentage and early growth of maize and two maize weeds, Amaranthus retroflexus and Echinochloa crus-galli, were assessed in a seed incubator in tilled (green manured) and nontilled (surface mulched) soil, with and without N fertilisation, at various dates after cover crop destruction. Responses were compared to those of the same species in a standard soil without mulch or with an inert poplar mulch. A second bioassay was set up in a glasshouse to determine the effect of different quantities of fresh residue material and additional N fertilisation on emergence speed and percentage and on plant vigour during the first 22 days after cover crop destruction. These results were compared with no-mulch controls and poplar mulch controls. Results of these trials were compared with weed density and biomass that developed in the maize crop sown after cover crop destruction. Soil and mulch chemical and biological properties were determined for material collected in the field at different times after cover crop destruction. Chemical properties of the mulch differed only occasionally between the treatments, but variation in cover crop biomass production led to significantly different soil chemical properties. Although soil total phenolic acid content did not always correlate to weed and maize germination and early growth inhibition, soil microbial activity did. In suboptimal conditions, as is often the case in the field, plant residue material exerted both a physical and a chemical effect on maize and weed emergence and early growth. Nitrogen fertilisation and application timing can give the maize crop a competitive advantage with respect to the weeds, but the final response and the practical consequences depended largely on the weed species involved.</abstract>

    <title>Distribution of Rupestris stem-pitting-associated virus variants in two Australian vineyards showing different symptoms.</title>
    <abstract>The incidence of Rupestris stem-pitting-associated virus (RSPaV) in two vineyards in South Australia was studied by comparing symptoms with the results obtained from biological indexing and from virus detection by reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Vineyard 1 was an experimental block comprising a number of varieties grafted onto Vitis rupestris cv. St George rootstocks for the detection of Rupestris stem pitting disease. No swelling at graft union or decline was observed at 3 years, but some vines showed pitting on the rootstock trunk. Vineyard 2 contained Vitis vinifera cv. Shiraz (Syn. Syrah) vines on Paulsen 1103 rootstock, showing a range of symptoms including swelling of the graft union, pitting on the rootstock, leaf reddening and vine decline, resembling those in Syrah Decline, a disorder known to occur in this variety. RT-PCR using the coat-protein-specific primers detected RSPaV in all samples from either vineyard including symptomless V. rupestris cv. St George, which is used as the biological indicator for the virus. In contrast, a pair of primers designed from the replicase gene detected the virus only in symptomatic vines, whereas the symptomless St George control and nonsymptomatic vines in both vineyards tested negative. An assay for 12 other major grapevine viruses showed that none were associated with either type of symptom. Comparison of a 628-bp amplicon on the replicase gene in 13 RSPaV isolates showed that while they had 96-99% nucleotide sequence identity to each other, their identity to the American isolates from California and New York was around 65%. This low homology may indicate that a different virus species is present. The variability was more pronounced between the two vineyards than among the virus isolates in the Shiraz vines within the same vineyard. However, even the vines of the same vineyard did not contain viruses with exactly the same sequence homology. We found no association between the type of symptom expressed and the sequence variation in the amplicons in either vineyard. The sequence variants in Vineyard 1 showed a closer cluster than in Vineyard 2.</abstract>

    <title>Bird Species Sensitivity in a Fragmented Landscape of the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil.</title>
    <abstract>I tested whether terrestrial[solidus]understory habits, large body sizes, low tolerance to edge or to matrix habitat, and food[solidus]habitat specialization are characteristics of the most vulnerable bird species based on point counts conducted in 14 forest fragments in northern Paraná, southern region of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. In addition, the sensitivity level of each bird species to forest fragmentation in northern Paraná (high, medium, and low) was compared to the Viçosa region, another fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest. Contrary to expectations, large body size and terrestrial[solidus]understory habits were not features clearly related to high sensitivity to forest fragmentation; but species with tolerance to edge did have lower sensitivity. I found also that specialized habitat[solidus]food were not good predictors of extinctions; the most specialized guilds, bamboo and vine-tangle insectivores and trunk and twig insectivores, had a high number of species with low sensitivity. Patterns of sensitivity were compared for 75 bird species that occurred in both northern Paraná and Viçosa; higher incongruence occurred for 14 and 7 species considered as highly sensitive in Viçosa but were of medium or low sensitivity, respectively, in northern Paraná. These differences may occur because sensitivity to habitat fragmentation may vary from the center to the periphery of a species' geographic range. Geographic variation in patterns of sensitivity to forest fragmentation may be important for conservation planning.</abstract>

    <title>Determinants of a social clause in international trade negotiations.</title>
    <abstract>Survey data are used to examine the determinants of a "social clause" in international trade negotiations. Proponents of such a clause argue that the inclusion of labor laws, environmental impacts, and other social issues in international trade negotiations would ensure fair competition, an equitable distribution of the benefits of free trade, and, in the case of labor, protect the basic rights of workers. Opponents see these arguments as a disguised form of protectionism and self-interest based on the protection of labor-intensive industries in developed countries. Results from a logit model indicate a decreased likelihood for the inclusion of a social clause in international trade negotiations across farm sizes. In particular the results suggest that agricultural producers with annual gross sales including government payments between US$500,000 and US$999,000, are 40% less likely to want labor laws, environmental impacts, and food safety standards to be included as part of international trade negotiations. The results also show that agricultural producers with college experience or college degrees are less likely to want these social interventions while second generation farmers and first generation farmers with a master's degree want labor laws, environmental impacts, and food safety standards to be included as part of international trade negotiations.</abstract>

    <abstract>A sample of Iowa farm couples is used to evaluate whether off-farm labor supply decisions respond to permanent and transitory components of farm income. Off-farm labor supply of both spouses declines in response to increases in permanent farm income. Farm wives also reduce off-farm labor supply in response to positive transitory farm income shocks. Consequently, one mechanism farm households use to smooth their goods consumption when facing fluctuating farm income is to modify their consumption of leisure. Ability to smooth goods consumption does not imply the absence of liquidity constraints among farm households unless leisure consumption is also smoothed.</abstract>

    <abstract>In the present study, the hypothesis tested was that Penaeus monodon post-larvae (PL) experience lower growth when exposed to crushed conspecifics, which was achieved by exposing individual P. monodon PL with abundant food for 4 weeks to a gradient from 0 to 100 crushed conspecific PL L[superscript [-]1]. Both dry weight (48.5±7.2 mg) and body size (28.0±1.3 mm) of animals exposed to 1 macerated PL L[superscript [-]1] were significantly (P</=0.011) higher than those of animals in treatments with 0, 5 and 10 crushed PL L[superscript [-]1] (average over treatments: 25.6±3.2 mg; 23.4±0.5 mm). All animals died within 1 week when exposed to 70 and 100 crushed PL L[superscript [-]1], and within 3-4 weeks when exposed to 50 and 30 crushed PL L[superscript [-]1]. Exposure time affected mortality and it appeared that LC₅₀ values decreased from 60 to 13 crushed PL L[superscript [-]1] from 1 to 4 weeks' exposure. Survival of P. monodon PL was negatively correlated to pH, biological oxygen demand, ammonia and nitrate. In conclusion, low dose of crushed conspecifics has a stimulatory effect on P. monodon PL, as larvae were heavier and larger, while high doses cause high mortality.</abstract>

    <abstract>The production performance of genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus) and freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) in periphyton-based systems were studied in farmers' ponds at Mymensingh, Bangladesh. Fifteen ponds (200-300 m² area and 1.0-1.5 m in depth) were used to compare five stocking ratios in triplicate: 100% GIFT, 75% GIFT plus 25% prawn, 50% GIFT plus 50% prawn, 25% GIFT plus 75% prawn and 100% prawn. Ponds were stocked at a total density of 20 000 GIFT and[solidus]or prawn ha[superscript [-]1]. Bamboo poles (mean diameter 6.2 cm and 5.5 pole m[superscript [-]2]) were posted in pond bottoms vertically as periphyton substrate. Periphyton biomass in terms of dry matter (DM), ash-free DM and chlorophyll a were significantly higher in ponds stocked with prawn alone than in ponds with different combinations of GIFT and prawn. Survival of GIFT was significantly lower in ponds stocked with 100% GIFT (monoculture) whereas, that of prawn was significantly higher in its monoculture ponds indicating detrimental effects of GIFT on prawn's survival. Individual weight gains for both species were significantly higher in polyculture than in monoculture. The highest total fish and prawn yield (1623 kg GIFT and 30 kg prawn ha[superscript [-]1]) over 125-140 days culture period was recorded in ponds with 75% GIFT and 25% prawn followed by 100% GIFT alone (1549 kg ha[superscript [-]1]), 50% GIFT plus 50% prawn (1114 kg GIFT and 68 kg prawn ha[superscript [-]1]), 25% GIFT plus 75% prawn (574 kg GIFT and 129 kg prawn ha[superscript [-]1]) and 100% prawn alone (157 kg ha[superscript [-]1]). This combination also gave the highest economic return. Therefore, a stocking ratio of 75% GIFT plus 25% prawn at a total density of 20 000 ha[superscript [-]1] appeared to be the best stocking ratio in terms of fish production as well as economics for a periphyton-based polyculture system.</abstract>

    <title>A simplified parametric model to describe the magnitude and geometry of soil shrinkage.</title>
    <abstract>Assessing the magnitude and geometry of soil shrinkage is indispensable for sound use and management of swelling and shrinking soils for agriculture and engineering. We have explored a simplified parametric model for the soil shrinkage characteristic curve, which is a measure for the magnitude of soil shrinkage, and tested it against experimental data for a Vertisol and a Lixisol under sugar cane in the Havana province, Cuba. We then applied the model to determine soil consistency limits, including the shrinkage, plastic and structural limits, using the model's third and fourth derivative. We further demonstrated how the model can be used to assess the geometry of shrinkage in terms of the relative crack area and the relative surface subsidence. Excellent matches were obtained between the observations and the fitted model. The shrinkage and structural limits corresponded to distinct changes in the soil shrinkage characteristic curve and were as such considered to be correctly estimated. The accuracy of the estimated plastic limit could, however, not been verified, since data were lacking. Linear regressions with R² > 0.88 were established relating the shrinkage and plastic limits to the soil's COLE index and the cation exchange capacity. The model could be easily applied to determine the crack area and the surface subsidence. We finally demonstrated how a geometry factor r[subscript s] plays a crucial role in determining the shrinkage geometry, particularly for r[subscript s] values ranging from 1 to 3.</abstract>

    <title>Humus components and biogenic structures under tropical slash-and-burn agriculture.</title>
    <abstract>Slash-and-burn cultivation in the humid tropics can cause changes in the composition of topsoil, depending on the duration of the fallow. We studied differences between practices, using the small-volume micromorphological method, to quantify the distribution of solid components in the topsoil, concentrating on plant organs and biogenic structures created by soil animals. We compared samples of topsoil from five plots, two at Maripasoula, an Aluku village along the Maroni river (French Guiana), with short fallow (= 8 years), and the other three at Elahe, a Wayana village along the same river, with long fallow (= 25 years). At both sites structures created by arthropods other than ants gave way to ones formed by ants and annelids under the influence of fire and cultivation. This change was more abrupt under long fallow, because of the time needed to restore the arthropod community. Charcoal and charred plant material were incorporated by earthworms into the mineral soil, forming dark grey to black aggregates. Charcoal became mixed with the mineral soil faster at Elahe than at Maripasoula, where it accumulated in the topsoil. The reason seems to be an imbalance between charcoal inputs (from repeated fires) and the capacity of burrowing animals (earthworms, ants) to mix it with the mineral soil.</abstract>

    <title>Contrasting population changes in sympatric penguin species in association with climate warming.</title>
    <abstract>Climate warming and associated sea ice reductions in Antarctica have modified habitat conditions for some species. These include the congeneric Adélie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins, which now demonstrate remarkable population responses to regional warming. However, inconsistencies in the direction of population changes between species at different study sites complicate the understanding of causal processes. Here, we show that at the South Orkney Islands where the three species breed sympatrically, the less ice-adapted gentoo penguins increased significantly in numbers over the last 26 years, whereas chinstrap and Adélie penguins both declined. These trends occurred in parallel with regional long-term warming and significant reduction in sea ice extent. Periodical warm events, with teleconnections to the tropical Pacific, caused cycles in sea ice leading to reduced prey biomass, and simultaneous interannual population decreases in the three penguin species. With the loss of sea ice, Adélie penguins were less buffered against the environment, their numbers fluctuated greatly and their population response was strong and linear. Chinstrap penguins, considered to be better adapted to ice-free conditions, were affected by discrete events of locally increased ice cover, but showed less variable, nonlinear responses to sea ice loss. Gentoo penguins were temporarily affected by negative anomalies in regional sea ice, but persistent sea ice reductions were likely to increase their available niche, which is likely to be substantially segregated from that of their more abundant congeners. Thus, the regional consequences of global climate perturbations on the sea ice phenology affect the marine ecosystem, with repercussions for penguin food supply and competition for resources. Ultimately, variability in penguin populations with warming reflects the local balance between penguin adaptation to ice conditions and trophic-mediated changes cascading from global climate forcing.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of the 2003 heatwave and climatic warming on mollusc communities of the Saône: a large lowland river and of its two main tributaries (France).</title>
    <abstract>The study of the dynamics of mollusc populations of the Saône and its two main tributaries, the Doubs and Ognon, over several years has provided us with the opportunity of highlighting the consequences of climatic warming and especially of the heatwave of 2003 on these organisms. From 1987 to 2003, the mean temperature of the waters of the Saône upstream of Lyon (Couzon) increased by 1.5°C. In addition, the summer of 2003 was the hottest since 1500 at least. We used correspondence analysis to identify structure change in mollusc data dating from September 1996 to December 2004. The results revealed: (1) during the period from September 1996 to July 2003, a significant progressive change in the mollusc community structure of the Saône upstream of Lyon, probably linked to the increase of temperature; (2) from July to August 2003 during the heatwave, a sudden change in the structure of mollusc communities and a significant decrease of species richness and density of gastropods and bivalves. During 2004, mollusc density and particularly that of Pisidium remained dramatically low. Similar observations were performed at four other sites along the Saône and in the lower reaches of its two main tributaries. This suggests that the resilience of the mollusc populations (i.e., the speed with which they return to a predisturbance state) to the heatwave is low. In this way, as different climatic models have predicted an increase in the frequency of summers as hot as that of 2003 during this century, more than half the mollusc species currently inhabiting the potamic area of the Saône, Doubs and Ognon, and probably other large rivers, are probably directly threatened with extinction.</abstract>

    <title>Occurrence of Bursaphelenchus species in declining Pinus sylvestris in a dry Alpine valley in Switzerland.</title>
    <abstract>We determined the incidence of Bursaphelenchus species in declining Pinus sylvestris stands in the Swiss Alps. A total of 217 trees showing different degree of decline were sampled from various locations in Valais between 2001 and 2004. Bursaphelenchus species were only found in recently dead or dying trees with an overall incidence of 40%. There was a positive relationship between Bursaphelenchus infestation and blue stain in these trees. Five Bursaphelenchus species were identified: Bursaphelenchus vallesianus, Bursaphelenchus mucronatus, Bursaphelenchus sexdentati, Bursaphelenchus leoni and Bursaphelenchus silvestris. The most frequent species were B. vallesianus detected in 75% and B. mucronatus in 20% of all Bursaphelenchus-positive trees. Bursaphelenchus vallesianus is a recently described species within the B. sexdentati group, and could be a contributing factor in the observed pine decline in Valais.</abstract>

    <title>Effective concentration of phosphite in controlling Phytophthora cinnamomi following stem injection of Banksia species and Eucalyptus marginata.</title>
    <abstract>The effect of phosphite concentration on lesion development by Phytophthora cinnamomi in stems and roots of Banksia grandis and Eucalyptus marginata and in stems of Banksia coccinea was assessed during a 4.3 year period after stem injection of phosphite. Lesion length 6 weeks after inoculation was significantly less in roots of B. grandis trees that had been stem injected with three concentrations of phosphite (50, 100 and 200 g phosphite/l) at two rates (1 and 2 ml/cm of stem circumference) compared with the not-injected control. With the exception of B. grandis trees injected with 50 g phosphite/l, lesion length for the high rate was not significantly different to the low rate. In roots of E. marginata, lesion development in response to phosphite was different to that in roots of B. grandis; lesion length in roots did not differ significantly between phosphite concentration and rate. Lesion length and girdling in stems of B. grandis and E. marginata was significantly less in those injected with phosphite than in not injected stems. One year after injection, callus tissue had contained lesions in stems injected with phosphite. By 4.3 years after injection of both hosts there was a steep significant negative linear relationship between phosphite concentration and either lesion length or girdling, with greatest lesion development in not injected stems and least in stems injected with 100 g phosphite/l. Recovery of P. cinnamomi from lesion margins 1 year after injection, was significantly less in trees injected with phosphite than in not injected trees. The amount of plant death reflected containment of lesion extension and girdling, and reduction of recovery of P. cinnamomi with phosphite concentration; 4.3 year after injection there was a steep significant negative linear relationship between phosphite concentration and percentage of plant death. In contrast to B. grandis and E. marginata, there was a U-shaped non-linear relationship between phosphite concentration and effectiveness of phosphite in controlling lesion extension and girdling in B. coccinea. Containment of lesion extension and girdling with time was greatest for B. coccinea stems injected with 25 g phosphite/l, least for stems not injected, and intermediate in stems injected with 50 and 100 g phosphite/l. As in B. grandis and E. marginata, containment of lesion extension and girdling in B. coccinea with phosphite concentration was reflected in the amount of plant death. The non-linear response to phosphite of some plant species indicated that injected concentration for B. coccinea should not exceed 50 g phosphite/l, whereas injected concentrations of up to 100 g phosphite/l could be recommended for B. grandis. Longevity of action of phosphite for 4-5 years in native plant species after one injection makes phosphite injection a practical control option for the control of P. cinnamomi disease front extension and the protection of threatened flora. Research into the effect of factors affecting longevity of action of phosphite would facilitate optimization of timing of injection.</abstract>

    <title>The Molecular Motor KIFC1 Associates with a Complex Containing Nucleoporin NUP62 That Is Regulated During Development and by the Small GTPase RAN.</title>
    <abstract>KIFC1 is a C-terminal kinesin motor associated with the nuclear membrane and acrosome in round and elongating spermatids. This location in developing spermatids is consistent with possible roles in acrosome elongation and manchette motility or both. Here we describe the association of the KIFC1 motor with a complex containing the nucleoporin NUP62. Formation of this complex is developmentally regulated, being absent before puberty and appearing only after nuclear elongation has begun. In addition, the integrity of this complex is dependent on GTP hydrolysis and the GTP state of the small GTPase RAN. Concomitant with the association of this motor with the NUP62-containing complex is an apparent reorganization of the nuclear pore with loss of NUP62 from larger complexes containing other nucleoporins. The association of KIFC1 with a component of the nuclear membrane is more consistent with a role for this motor in acrosome/manchette transport along the nuclear membrane than for a role for this motor in transport of vesicles along the outer face of the manchette.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of Enucleation and Caffeine on Maturation-Promoting Factor (MPF) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Activities in Ovine Oocytes Used as Recipient Cytoplasts for Nuclear Transfer.</title>
    <abstract>In general, oocytes arrested at metaphase of the second meiotic division (MII) are used as recipient cytoplasts for nuclear transfer (NT) procedures. MII oocytes contain high levels of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which cause nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and premature chromosome condensation (PCC) in the transferred nucleus and have been implicated in nuclear reprogramming. However, the occurrence of NEBD and the extent of PCC are variable between individual oocytes and species and are dependent on donor cell type and cell cycle stage. Enucleation, which removes oocyte cytoplasm, may reduce MPF and MAPK activities and reduce reprogramming; conversely, increasing kinase activities may increase reprogramming. We compared the effects of enucleation of ovine oocytes at anaphase/telophase of the first meiotic division (AI-TI) and at MII. MPF and MAPK activities were maximal at MII; blind enucleation at AI-TI was more efficient than at MII and removed a smaller volume of cytoplasm. Neither protocol significantly affected the activity of either kinase and the fate of the donor nucleus; however, enucleation per se significantly reduced the occurrence of NEBD in NT embryos. Treatment with 10 mM caffeine significantly increased the activities of both kinases and the occurrence of NEBD but did not affect the frequency of development to the blastocyst stage; however, a significant increase in total cell numbers was observed. The results show that caffeine can increase MPF and MAPK activities in ovine oocytes and that this may contribute to an increased reprogramming in NT embryos.</abstract>

    <title>Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins may regulate innate immune responses by modulating the life span of granulocytes.</title>
    <abstract>The regulation of cell death is a key element in building up and maintaining both innate and adaptive immunity. A critical role in this process plays the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor family of death receptors. Recent work suggests that sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig) -like lectins (Siglecs) are also empowered to transmit death signals, at least into myeloid cells. Strikingly, death induction by Siglecs is enhanced when cells are exposed to proinflammatory survival cytokines. Based on these recent insights, we hypothesize that at least some members of the Siglec family regulate immune responses via the activation of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death pathways.--von Gunten, S., Simon, H.-U.

    <title>Beta-catenin regulates wound size and mediates the effect of TGF-beta in cutaneous healing.</title>
    <abstract>After cutaneous injury, a variety of cell types are activated to reconstitute the epithelial and dermal components of the skin. {szligbeta}-Catenin plays disparate roles in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, inhibiting keratinocyte migration and activating fibroblast proliferation, suggesting that {szligbeta}-catenin could either inhibit or enhance the healing process. How {szligbeta}-catenin functions in concert with other signaling pathways important in the healing process is unknown. Wound size was examined in mice expressing conditional null or conditional stabilized alleles of {szligbeta}-catenin, regulated by an adenovirus expressing cre-recombinase. The size of the wounds in the mice correlated with the protein level of {szligbeta}-catenin. Using mice expressing these conditional alleles, we found that the wound phenotype imparted by Smad3 deficiency and by the injection of TGF{szligbeta} before wounding is mediated in part by {szligbeta}-catenin. TGF{szligbeta} was not able to regulate proliferation in {szligbeta}-catenin null fibroblasts, whereas keratinocyte proliferation rate was independent of {szligbeta}-catenin. When mice are treated with lithium, {szligbeta}-catenin-mediated signaling was activated in cutaneous wounds, which healed with a larger size. These results demonstrate a crucial role for {szligbeta}-catenin in regulating cutaneous wound size. Furthermore, these data implicate mesenchymal cells as playing a critical role regulating wound size.--Cheon, S. S., Wei, Q., Gurung, A., Youn, A., Bright, T., Poon, R., Whetstone, H., Guha, A., Alman, B. A. Beta-catenin regulates wound size and mediates the effect of TGF-beta in cutaneous healing.</abstract>

    <title>Chitosan derivatives bearing cyclodextrin cavities as novel adsorbent matrices</title>
    <abstract>Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides which have recently been recognized as useful adsorbent matrices. Due to its hydrophobic cavity, CDs can interact with appropriately sized molecules to result in the formation of inclusion complexes. These complexes are of interest for scientific research as they exist in aqueous solution and can be used to study the hydrophobic interactions which are important in the biomedical and environmental fields. The grafting of CD onto chitosan can result in the formation of a molecular carrier that possess the cumulative effects of inclusion, size specificity and transport properties of CDs as well as the controlled release ability of the polymeric matrix. In this review, different methods of CD grafting onto chitosan are discussed. In addition, the inclusion ability and the controlled release properties of CD grafted chitosan derivatives and their mechanisms of host-guest complexation with organic molecules are reviewed.</abstract>

    <title>CHANGES IN TEXTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PANEER IN READY-TO-EAT CANNED PANEER CURRY DURING STORAGE.</title>
    <abstract>Paneer is an Indian soft cheese obtained by coagulating hot milk using citric acid or vinegar, pressing the hot coagulum and cooling by dipping in chilled water. In this study, paneer curry with a water activity (A[subscript w]) of 0.95 and a pH of 5.0 was prepared using ingredients like tomatoes, onions, cream, milk powder, curds and different spices, then canned at an F value of 0.80 (lethality). The product was stored at 15, 30 and 45C, and change in textural characteristics during storage was studied. Cohesiveness and chewiness increased, but hardness decreased. These changes were attributed to continued changes in texture initiated by frying of paneer and canning process. These were also linked to Maillard browning which progressed during storage as measured by hydroxymethylfurfural content. These changes were found to be slower vis-à-vis those observed in the product, which was sterilized at conventional F value of 15.0 (control) (A[subscript w] = 0.98 and pH 5.2).</abstract>

    <title>COMPARISON OF ALLO-KRAMER, WARNER-BRATZLER AND RAZOR BLADE SHEARS FOR PREDICTING SENSORY TENDERNESS OF BROILER BREAST MEAT.</title>
    <abstract>Regression models were established to predict sensory tenderness of broiler pectoralis major muscles from instrumental shear values. Birds were processed and the breasts were removed at one of nine postmortem (PM) deboning times: 0.25, 1.25, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 6.0 and 24.0 h. A seven-member trained panel evaluated the cooked samples for initial hardness, cohesiveness, moisture release, hardness of mass, cohesiveness of mass and number of chews. A 74-member consumer panel was used to evaluate the samples for acceptance of overall texture and tenderness, appropriateness of juiciness and tenderness, and intensity of tenderness. The samples were analyzed using three instrumental shear tests (Allo-Kramer [AK], Warner-Bratzler [WB] and razor blade [RB]). Shear values and sensory scores were significantly affected by PM deboning time. Shear values correlated well with descriptive sensory attributes (R[superscript 2] = 0.57 [-] 0.89) and consumer sensory attributes (R[superscript 2] = 0.76 [-] 0.96). Descriptive sensory tenderness (hardness) was predicted better by the RB test, while consumer tenderness was predicted well equivalently by all three shear tests. As the RB test is simple and rapid, it is recommended that it be evaluated by the poultry industry as a quality control method.</abstract>

    <title>Relationships between microbial biomass nitrogen, nitrate leaching and nitrogen uptake by corn in a compost and chemical fertilizer-amended regosol.</title>
    <abstract>To determine the relationships between microbial biomass nitrogen (N), nitrate-nitrogen leaching (NO₃-N leaching) and N uptake by plants, a field experiment and a soil column experiment were conducted. In the field experiment, microbial biomass N, 0.5 mol L[superscript [-]1] K₂SO₄ extractable N (extractable N), NO₃-N leaching and N uptake by corn were monitored in sawdust compost (SDC: 20 Mg ha[superscript [-]1] containing 158 kg N ha[superscript [-]1] of total N [approximately 50% is easily decomposable organic N]), chemical fertilizer (CF) and no fertilizer (NF) treatments from May 2000 to September 2002. In the soil column experiment, microbial biomass N, extractable N and NO₃-N leaching were monitored in soil treated with SDC (20 Mg ha[superscript [-]1]) [+] rice straw (RS) at five different application rates (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 Mg ha[superscript [-]1] containing 0, 15, 29, 44 and 59 kg N ha[superscript [-]1]) and in soil treated with CF in 2001. Nitrogen was applied as (NH₄)₂SO₄ at rates of 220 kg N ha[superscript [-]1] for SDC and SDC [+] RS treatments and at a rate of 300 kg N ha[superscript [-]1] for the CF treatment in both experiments. In the field experiment, microbial biomass N in the SDC treatment increased to 147 kg N ha[superscript [-]1] at 7 days after treatment (DAT) and was maintained at 60-70 kg N ha[superscript [-]1] after 30 days. Conversely, microbial biomass N in the CF treatment did not increase significantly. Extractable N in the surface soil increased immediately after treatment, but was found at lower levels in the SDC treatment compared to the CF treatment until 7 DAT. A small amount of NO₃-N leaching was observed until 21 DAT and increased markedly from 27 to 42 DAT in the SDC and CF treatments. Cumulative NO₃-N leaching in the CF treatment was 146 kg N ha[superscript [-]1], which was equal to half of the applied N, but only 53 kg N ha[superscript [-]1] in the SDC treatment. In contrast, there was no significant difference between N uptake by corn in the SDC and CF treatments. In the soil column experiment, microbial biomass N in the SDC [+] RS treatment at 7 DAT increased with increased RS application. Conversely, extractable N at 7 DAT and cumulative NO₃-N leaching until 42 DAT decreased with increased RS application. In both experiments, microbial biomass N was negatively correlated with extractable N at 7 DAT and cumulative NO₃-N leaching until 42 DAT, and extractable N was positively correlated with cumulative NO₃-N leaching. We concluded that microbial biomass N formation in the surface soil decreased extractable N and, consequently, contributed to decreasing NO₃-N leaching without impacting negatively on N uptake by plants.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of low phosphorus and iron-deficient conditions on phytosiderophore release and mineral nutrition in barley.</title>
    <abstract>To investigate the effect of low phosphorus (P) conditions on phytosiderophore (PS) release and mineral nutrient status in graminaceous plants, an experiment was conducted in a phytotron with barley plants grown in iron-deficient (Fe0) nutrient solutions with four P levels (0.5, 5, 50, 500 [control][micro]mol L[superscript [-]1]) at pH 6.5 for 21 days after treatment (DAT). The results showed that the growth and chlorophyll index of plants cultured under low P conditions (0.5, 5 and 50 [micro]mol L[superscript [-]1]) were higher than those of the control plants. The accumulation amount (mg or [micro]g/plant) of mineral nutrients in shoots was higher for potassium, iron and copper in plants in the low P treatment than in the control plants. The accumulation of PS in roots and the amount of PS released from the roots at 14 DAT were lower in plants in the Fe0 and low P treatments. These results indicated that low P depressed PS release from roots and PS accumulation in roots in Fe0 barley. This might result from the higher Fe content in shoots and the alleviation of Fe chlorosis with low P treatment of plants. These results showed that low P treatment enhanced the growth, chlorophyll index and Fe mobilization to shoots in Fe0 barley. Low P conditions alleviated Fe-deficiency symptoms, suggesting that P is physiologically competing with Fe in plant tissues.</abstract>

    <title>Expression of a putative laccase gene, ZmLAC1, in maize primary roots under stress*.</title>
    <abstract>Laccases are multi-copper-containing glycoproteins and comprise a multi-gene family in plants. However, their physiological functions are still not well understood. We obtained sequence information for a putative laccase gene, ZmLAC1, from maize and studied ZmLAC1 expression in detail. The deduced ZmLAC1 protein was 70% identical to LpLAC5-4, a laccase from ryegrass. ZmLAC1 was expressed in leaves, stems and roots of maize seedlings. In unstressed maize primary roots, a higher ZmLAC1 transcript level was located in the basal region where cell elongation had ceased compared to the apical 5 mm of the roots where cells were rapidly dividing and elongating. A treatment with 300 mm NaCl resulted in a shortened root elongation zone (< 2 mm) and swelling in the apical 5 mm. Associated with the morphological change, the transcript level of ZmLAC1 was enhanced in the apical 5 mm, reaching a level similar to that in the basal region. Other abiotic stresses tested - such as 28.5% polyethylene glycol (PEG), which caused an inhibition of root elongation comparable to 300 mm NaCl - did not affect ZmLAC1 transcript level. Potential roles of ZmLAC1 in the roots responding to NaCl or other high concentration of salts are discussed.</abstract>

    <title>The characteristics of Ca[superscript [+][+]]-activated Cl⁻ channels of the salt-tolerant charophyte Lamprothamnium.</title>
    <abstract>The dependence of the Ca[superscript [+][+]]-activated Cl⁻ channels on potential difference (PD) was extracted from current-voltage (I/V) profiles recorded at the time of hypotonic regulation while the large conductance (G) K[superscript [+]] channels were blocked by tetraethylammonium (TEA). The total clamp current (I) was dominated by the Cl⁻I, i[subscript Cl], with small contribution from the background I (i[subscript background]). The i[subscript Cl] was fitted by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) model with enhanced PD dependence simulated by Boltzmann probability distributions. The i[subscript background] was modelled by an empirical equation. The i[subscript Cl] responded to PD changes within tens of milliseconds. The G maxima were located between [-]20 and [-]150 mV. The Cl⁻ channel number and channel permeability parameter, N[subscript Cl]P[subscript Cl], decreased as a function of time in a hypotonic medium (from 0.45 [multiplication] 10[superscript [-]7] to 0.17 [multiplication] 10[superscript [-]7] ms[superscript [-]1] in 19 min), with the positive half activation PD, V[subscript 50[+]], shifting from [+]35 to [-]65 mV, and the negative half activation PD, V₅₀₋, shifting from [-]134 to [-]310 mV. The fitted Cl⁻ concentration [Cl⁻][subscript cyt] at the time of hypotonic regulation indicated rapid equalization of vacuolar and cytoplasmic concentrations. Excellent data obtained under similar experimental conditions in a previous study enabled us to infer [Ca[superscript [+][+]]][subscript cyt] influences on the Cl⁻ channel characteristics. Thick sulphated polysaccharide mucilage, found on Lamprothamnium cells acclimated to more saline media, eliminated the activation of the i[subscript Cl] at the time of the hypotonic regulation. This effect was reversed by the application of the enzyme heparinase. The characteristics of the i[subscript Cl] were found to be consistent with a component of the excitation Is at the time of the action potential (AP). The short duration of the excitation transients was contrasted with that of the hypotonic regulation. The mechanisms for Cl⁻ channel activation (and hence the Ca[superscript [+][+]] channel activation) were considered.</abstract>

    <title>Development of Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase PCR Assays To Detect and Serotype Dengue Viruses.</title>
    <abstract>Serotyping dengue virus (DENV) from suspect human specimens is crucial for developing sound epidemiological control measurements early in the transmission season and for effective patient management. We modified DENV consensus D1 (mD1) and serotype-specific TS2 (mTS2) and redesigned serotype-specific TS1 (rTS1) and TS4 (rTS4) as described previously in the conventional capsid and premembrane gene (C-prM) protocol (R. S. Lanciotti, C. H. Calisher, D. J. Gubler, G.-J. Chang, A. V. Vorndam, J. Clin. Microbiol. 30:545-551, 1992). In addition, we designed two new sets of amplimers and probes, located at nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) and the 3' noncoding region (3'NC) of DENV. The NS5 protocol utilizes two flaviviral consensus outer amplimers (mFU1 and CFD2) and four dengue virus serotype-specific TaqMan fluorogenic probes. The 3'NC protocol uses two DENV consensus amplimers, DC10418 and CDC10564. The conventional gel-based, heminested detection method was adapted for the C-prM protocol for detecting and serotyping dengue viruses. In addition, we developed the real-time SYBR green I and postamplification melting temperature curve analysis for the mD1/TS and 3'NC protocols using identical amplification conditions. The NS5 amplimer/probe set was formulated as a one-tube, multiplex, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for serotype identification. Three sets of amplimers and probes were verified for their specificity in tests with yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and West Nile viruses; optimized against 109 DENV strains; and validated for detection of the virus in sera from two different panels of acute-phase human dengue serum specimens and one panel of virus isolates from dengue patients' serum specimens. Clinical evaluation by two separate laboratories indicated that the C-prM was more sensitive (100%) than the NS5 (91%) or the 3'NC (91%) protocol.</abstract>

    <title>Occurrence of Overlooked Zoonotic Tuberculosis: Detection of Mycobacterium bovis in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid.</title>
    <abstract>The paucibacillary nature of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been a major obstacle in the diagnosis of human tuberculous meningitis (TBM). This study shows that with molecular techniques direct precise determination to the species level of mycobacterial pathogens can be made. The present report describes the utility of a nested PCR (N-PCR) assay (A. Mishra, A. Singhal, D. S. Chauhan, V. M. Katoch, K. Srivastava, S. S. Thakral, S. S. Bharadwaj, V. Sreenivas, and H. K. Prasad, J. Clin. Microbiol. 43:5670-5678, 2005) in detecting M. tuberculosis and M. bovis in human CSF. In 2.8% (6/212) of the samples, M. tuberculosis was detected, and in 17% (36/212), M. bovis was detected. Mixed infection was observed in 22 samples. Comparative analysis of clinical diagnosis, smear microscopy, and N-PCR in 69 patients (TBM, 25; non-TBM, 44) showed that the sensitivity of N-PCR (61.5%) was greater than that of smear microscopy (38.4%). Determination to the species level is important from the viewpoint of determining the prevalence of these mycobacteria in a community and would influence strategies currently adopted for the prevention of tuberculosis.</abstract>

    <abstract>We have developed near-isogenic introgression lines (NIILs) of an elite indica rice cultivar (IR64) with the genes for β-carotene biosynthesis from dihaploid (DH) derivatives of golden japonica rice (cv. T309). A careful analysis of the DH lines indicated the integration of the genes of interest [phytoene synthase (psy) and phytoene desaturase (crtI)] and the selectable marker gene (hygromycin phosphotransferase, hph) in two unlinked loci. During subsequent crossing, progenies could be obtained carrying only the locus with psy and crtI, which was segregated independently from the locus containing the hph gene during meiotic segregation. The NIILs (BC₂F₂) showed maximum similarity with the recurrent parent cultivar IR64. Further, progenies of two NIILs were devoid of any fragments beyond the left or right border, including the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) antibiotic resistance gene of the transformation vector. Spectrophotometric readings showed the accumulation of up to 1.06 μg total carotenoids, including β-carotene, in 1 g of the endosperm. The accumulation of β-carotene was also evident from the clearly visible yellow colour of the polished seeds.</abstract>

It is argued that as a result of market reforms, social and economic relations have evolved beyond stratification, and that, rather, a rural class structure is emerging. Five measures of an emerging class structure are posited: income stratification, land holdings, capital stock, class consciousness, and shared attitudes and values. Focusing on upper and lower income strata, significant differences are documented for each measure. The economic and political implications of the findings are discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Development of microsatellite markers in ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.).</title>
    <abstract>Ginkgo biloba L. is one of the oldest unevolved tree species on Earth. We isolated five polymorphic microsatellite loci from G. biloba using a dual-suppression polymerase chain reaction technique. These loci provided microsatellite markers with high polymorphism ranging from three to 13 alleles per locus. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.667 to 0.952 and from 0.640 to 0.897, respectively. The markers will contribute to research on the conservation, genetic diversity and mating patterns of G. biloba.</abstract>

    <title>Pesticides in groundwater: some observations on temporal and spatial trends.</title>
    <abstract>Following a monitoring programme of private shallow boreholes a total of 22 different pesticides were detected in 14 shallow boreholes in the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer of south Yorkshire, UK between January 2002 and November 2003. Of the 294 positive detections made, 34% were detected in excess of the permitted concentration value (PCV) (drinking water standard) for individual pesticides. Pesticides were detected in 11 (78%) of the boreholes, and in eight (57%) at concentrations exceeding the PCV on at least one occasion. These findings were complemented by data from deeper boreholes in which concentrations exceeding the PCV were also detected. Pesticide occurrence could be related to landuse; mecoprop and isoproturon were frequently detected at several locations reflecting the arable landuse, dicamba at a golf course, and atrazine, propazine and terbutryn near a railway. Temporal variations have emerged at individual sites and across the study area as the result of extended and frequent monitoring.</abstract>

    <title>Use of Picard and Newton Iteration for Solving Nonlinear Ground Water Flow Equations.</title>
    <abstract>This study examines the use of Picard and Newton iteration to solve the nonlinear, saturated ground water flow equation. Here, a simple three-node problem is used to demonstrate the convergence difficulties that can arise when solving the nonlinear, saturated ground water flow equation in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with and without nonlinear boundary conditions. For these cases, the characteristic types of convergence patterns are examined. Viewing these convergence patterns as orbits of an attractor in a dynamical system provides further insight. It is shown that the nonlinearity that arises from nonlinear head-dependent boundary conditions can cause more convergence difficulties than the nonlinearity that arises from flow in an unconfined aquifer. Furthermore, the effects of damping on both convergence and convergence rate are investigated. It is shown that no single strategy is effective for all problems and how understanding pitfalls and merits of several methods can be helpful in overcoming convergence difficulties. Results show that Picard iterations can be a simple and effective method for the solution of nonlinear, saturated ground water flow problems.</abstract>

    <title>Aquifer Responses to El Niño-Southern Oscillation, Southwest British Columbia.</title>
    <abstract>We used climatological composite analysis to investigate El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals in long-term shallow ground water level observations from four wells in the lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia. Significance of differences between warm-phase, cold-phase, and neutral climate states was assessed with a Monte Carlo bootstrap technique. We also considered time series of local precipitation and streamflow for comparison. Composite annual hyetographs suggest that ENSO precipitation impacts are largely limited to winter and spring, with higher and lower rainfall occurring, respectively, under cold-phase and warm-phase episodes. This is consistent with prior work in the region and is found to be directly reflected in both streamflow and ground water level data. The mean magnitude of ENSO terrestrial hydrologic anomalies can be up to ~50% of the average seasonal cycle amplitude. ENSO does not appear to systematically affect annual hydrometeorological cycle timing in this study area. However, relative to the surface hydrologic systems considered, aquifers are observed to retain a stronger memory of seasonal ENSO-related precipitation anomalies, with changes potentially extending through the following summer, presumably reflecting storage effects. Most responses appear to be somewhat nonlinear.</abstract>

    <title>Relative strengths of benthic algal nutrient and grazer limitation along a lake productivity gradient</title>
    <abstract>The relative effects of nutrients and herbivores on primary producers are rarely compared across ecosystems that vary in potential primary productivity. Furthermore, proposed mechanisms to explain such patterns remain understudied. Here, I examine the strength of nutrient and grazer (herbivore) limitation (i.e., the extent to which producers' growth is limited by insufficient nutrient supply or herbivory) of benthic algae across 13 southwest Michigan lakes that vary widely in productivity (i.e., resource supply). I compare the observed patterns of algal limitation and species composition to those predicted by two simple models: one that includes multiple species and species' traits (the food-web model) and one that includes no variation in species or traits (the food-chain model). Species in the food-web model are assumed to display a tradeoff between resource competitive ability and resistance to herbivory (the “keystone predator” tradeoff). Among these lakes, benthic algal nutrient limitation was positive [graphic removed] and declined significantly along a lake N:P gradient. In contrast, grazer limitation was negative [graphic removed] and was not significantly related to any of the measured lake productivity variables. Negative grazer limitation indicated that the removal of grazers caused unexpected declines in algal biomass, which were potentially due to indirect, positive effects (e.g., nutrient recycling) of grazers. Nutrient limitation was significantly stronger than grazer limitation across lakes, which was more consistent with the food-web versus food-chain model. Changes in algal composition were also broadly consistent with predictions of the food-web model in that vulnerable, superior nutrient competitors dominated in low productivity lakes and more grazer-resistant species were observed in high productivity lakes. In general, these results point to the importance of examining limiting factors across systems and the consideration of key species' traits when predicting and interpreting patterns.</abstract>

    <title>Expression patterns of low temperature responsive genes in a dominant ABA-less-sensitive mutant line of common wheat</title>
    <abstract>Abscisic acid (ABA) plays important role in mediating stress responses and in acquiring desiccation tolerance and dormancy of plant seeds. To study roles of ABA in cold acclimation and freezing tolerance in wheat, expression profiles of Cor/Lea and their putative transcription factor (TF) genes were analysed using a dominant mutation line of common wheat EH47-1 lacking seed dormancy. The mutant line was less sensitive to exogenous ABA than the original line as judged by the magnitude of ABA inhibition of seedling growth. Expression analysis of Cor/Lea and TF genes however, showed that more transcripts were present in ABA-treated seedlings of the mutant line. In developing caryopses, the same tendency was observed. The mutant line showed no changes in the cold acclimation ability, but it showed a higher level of freezing tolerance than the original line without cold acclimation. No significant differences were observed in the expression profiles of Cor/Lea and TF genes during cold acclimation between the two lines. Our results imply the presence of an unknown ABA-dependent cold responsive pathway, which enhances the basal level of freezing tolerance by a dominant mutation in EH47-1.</abstract>

    <title>Irradiance levels affect growth parameters and carotenoid pigments in kale and spinach grown in a controlled environment</title>
    <abstract>Carotenoids play critical roles in both light harvesting and energy dissipation for the protection of photosynthetic structures. However, limited research is available on the impact of irradiance on the production of secondary plant compounds, such as carotenoid pigments. Kale (Brassica oleracea L.) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) are two leafy vegetables high in lutein and β-carotene carotenoids. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of different irradiance levels on tissue biomass, elemental nutrient concentrations, and lutein β-carotene and chlorophyll (chl) pigment accumulation in the leaves of kale and spinach. 'Winterbor' kale and 'Melody' spinach were grown in nutrient solution culture in growth chambers at average irradiance levels of 125, 200, 335, 460, and 620 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹. Highest tissue lutein β-carotene and chls occurred at 335 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ for kale, and 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ for spinach. The accumulations of lutein and β-carotene were significantly different among irradiance levels for kale, but were not significantly different for spinach. However, lutein and β-carotene accumulation was significant for spinach when computed on a dry mass basis. Identifying effects of irradiance on carotenoid accumulation in kale and spinach is important information for growers producing these crops for dry capsule supplements and fresh markets.</abstract>

    <title>COMPOSITIONAL CHANGES OF STRAWBERRY DUE TO DEHYDRATION, COLD STORAGE AND FREEZING-THAWING PROCESSES.</title>
    <abstract>Strawberry is an excellent source of food ingredients, although compositional changes might occur in improperly controlled processing, affecting product quality. In this article, changes in sugar composition (glucose, fructose and sucrose), citric acid, water and total soluble content, as induced by partial dehydration and freezing-thawing processes, were analyzed in strawberries (var. Camarosa). Osmotic dehydration (OD) with 65 °Brix sucrose solution, air drying (AD) at 45C, or combined treatments (OD-AD) were applied to reduce strawberries' water content to 70-85%. Fresh and dehydrated samples were frozen (-40C, 24 h) and stored (-18C, 30 and 180 days). All samples processed by OD and OD-AD showed a significant sugar gain, and depending on the dehydration treatment, total or partial sucrose hydrolysis was observed. Dehydration treatments caused small losses of citric acid. During the freezing-thawing process, drip loss and enzymatic action also cause changes in sugar concentration, especially in OD-treated samples.</abstract>

    <title>EXTRUDED CORN MEAL AND WHEY PROTEIN CONCENTRATE: EFFECT OF PARTICLE SIZE.</title>
    <abstract>Blends of whey protein concentrate (WPC) and corn meal, which were separated into four particle fractions (residual on a #30 screen, #40 screen, #60 screen and through a #60 screen), were extruded at two moisture conditions (23 and 28%) to determine the effects of particle size on the extrudate properties. Smaller particle size fractions exhibited increased solubility and significantly higher viscosity both with and without added protein. When WPC was added to the corn meal, a large reduction in paste viscosity was observed regardless of the particle size. The blend with similar particle size distributions of corn meal and WPC had a significantly higher viscosity than the other blends. The expansion ratio, porosity and breaking strength of this blend, when extruded at the lower moisture content, were improved to the extent that they behaved similarly to extrudate made from corn meal alone.</abstract>

    <title>Survival of Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecium in sludge evaluated by real-time PCR and culture methods</title>
    <abstract>This study evaluates the behaviour in spiked sludge of a pathogenic bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, by cultural and molecular techniques, and compares its survival with the one of a faecal indicator, Enterococcus faecium. Listeria monocytogenes strain Scott A and E. faeciumT were followed for 17 days after inoculation in sludge. Kinetics of survival depended on the bacteria and on the technique used [most probable number method, direct plate count or real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)]. The concentration of L. monocytogenes decreased rapidly regardless of the technique, but the decrease was much more dramatic with culture techniques than with qPCR. On the contrary, the concentrations of culturable E. faeciumT were stable. The results suggest that the cells of L. monocytogenes strain Scott A might have entered a viable, but nonculturable (VBNC) status, whereas cells of the indicator bacteria, E. faeciumT, maintained themselves better and stayed culturable. The difference of survival kinetics in the sludge of a faecal indicator (E. faecium) and a pathogenic bacterium (L. monocytogenes) may be linked to the fact that they either enter or do not enter into a VBNC status.</abstract>

    <title>Shrimp vaccination trials with the VP292 protein of white spot syndrome virus</title>
    <abstract>Construction of a recombinant vector that expresses VP292 protein of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and to exploit the possibility of obtaining the vaccine conferring protection against WSSV infection in shrimps. VP292 protein of WSSV was amplified from WSSV genomic DNA by PCR. The target 814 bp amplified product specific for VP292 protein was inserted in to pQE30 expression vector. The recombinant plasmid of VP292 protein was transformed and expressed in Escherichia coli under induction of isopropyl-1-1-thio-β- [smallcapital d]-galactoside (IPTG) and the immunoreactivity of the fusion protein was detected by Western blot. Shrimp were vaccinated by intramuscular injection of the purified protein VP292 of WSSV and challenged for 0-30 days. Vaccination trial experiments show that two injections with recombinant VP292 (rVP292) protein induced a higher resistance, with 52% relative percentage survival value, in the shrimp at the 30th day postvaccination. The expression system of protein VP292 of WSSV with a high efficiency has been successfully constructed. Vaccination trials show significant resistance in the shrimp vaccinated twice with recombinant VP292. Results of this study prosper the development of WSSV protein vaccine against WSSV infection in shrimps.</abstract>

    <title>IMPACT OF MICROWAVE BLANCHING ON THE FLAVOR OF ROASTED PEANUTS.</title>
    <abstract>Microwave blanching of peanuts was proposed as an attractive alternative to traditional techniques of blanching, because of energy and time savings. However, the occurrence of a processing-related off-flavor has been reported. This study examined the effect of processing factors during microwave blanching on the MC and sensory characteristics of the peanuts. The peanuts reached a range of internal temperatures during microwave blanching treatments between 4 and 11 min. A total offnote attribute was introduced to the peanut lexicon and was used successfully to differentiate the effects of microwave treatments. The microwave-associated off-flavor was related (but not identical) to cardboardy/stale flavor, and was related inversely to the positive flavor attributes roasted peanutty, sweet aromatic and sweet taste. Peanuts reaching the highest internal temperatures and greatest moisture losses during blanching exhibited the most total offnote flavor; however, temperatures as high as 113C did not produce significantly increased total offnote intensity.</abstract>

    <title>EXPECTATIONS AND STABILITY OF PREFERENCE CHOICE.</title>
    <abstract>When identical milk samples are presented, only 30% of participants respond with a "no preference" rating. Stability of the "no preference" rating was studied under a variety of conditions, having consumer panelists rate both identical and different pairs of milk samples with varying fat content. The proportion of participants choosing the "no preference" option, when the samples in the pair were identical, was largely consistent despite manipulation of pretest conditions and changes in test questions and answer formats. However, when the milk preference test was preceded by a same/different test, and those responding "same" were assumed to have no preference, the percent of "no preference" was two to three times larger for identical test samples (60-69%). Thus by branching the question, the "false preference" choice for identical milks was lowered. Among those responding "different" to identical milks, the false-alarm rate increased to 91%, suggesting that perception of (spurious or momentary) differences is driving at least part of the preference choice.</abstract>

    <title>A Hedonic Price Analysis of Farmland Option Premiums Under Urban Influences.</title>
    <abstract>An emerging theory, real option pricing, suggests that an important component of urban fringe farmland values may be the option value arising from nearby urban development. This new option pricing theory, as opposed to its standard conventional counterpart in finance, incorporates both the uncertainty about the future net benefits of a land conversion decision and the irreversibility of this action taken. We demonstrate that parsimonious empirical hedonic models of the errors-in-variables type, when corrected for heteroskedasticity, can provide adequate representations of farmland option premiums. Data for a random sample of cash rented Ohio farmland parcels are used, and the impacts of urban development on farmland option premiums are estimated. Results provide evidence that (a) both land-use conversion probability and urban influences have been important factors affecting the option value of the state's farmland, and (b) these option premiums associated with irreversible and uncertain land development are capitalized into farmland values.</abstract>

    <title>Costs and Risks of Segregating GM Wheat in Canada.</title>
    <abstract>An analytical model was developed to explore prospective costs and risks of alternative testing strategies for a marketing system in Canada which markets both genetically modified (GM) and Non-GM wheats. The problem is solved using stochastic optimization, base case results are defined, and sensitivities conducted to evaluate impacts of selected variables. Added costs include: testing, rejection, and a risk premium which is required for handlers to be indifferent between the current and the proposed dual system. Protocols would require testing at the point of loading at the primary elevator, and export elevator, and supplementing this information with some form of grower variety declaration. There are several sources of inherent risks in such a system. For buyers, the cumulative impact of these is the risk of receiving GM content in a Non-GM shipment. For sellers, it is the risk of having a Non-GM shipment rejected. For sellers, the risk of rejection was typically less than 2%, and for buyers, the risk was typically less than 0.02%.</abstract>

    <title>Incorporating nutrients into meat demand analysis using household budgets data</title>
    <abstract>The objective of this article is to analyze the Spanish demand for meat, taking into account the consumer's concern about the relationship between food diet and health. This concern is forcing food demand analysts to assume that consumer utility is a function of nutrients instead of simply the food products themselves. Nevertheless, these utility function arguments are not produced in the marketplace but rather at home. As a consequence, in this article household production theory is followed in order to analyze Spanish demand for meat using the Quarterly National Expenditure Survey for 1999. Demands for several meat products (the input in the model) are derived from the translog cost function. Censored regression models are used in the estimation process, since many zero responses are reported. Five broad categories, eight nutrients, and the most relevant socioeconomic variables are considered. Finally, a set of elasticities is calculated with respect to all the variables included in the analysis.</abstract>

    <title>Estimates of overweight and obesity among samples of preschool-aged children in Melbourne and Sydney.</title>
    <abstract>Childhood obesity is a significant and increasing public health issue. We present results from two cross-sectional surveys from Melbourne and Sydney that sought to estimate the level of overweight and obesity among preschool-aged children. In Melbourne, weight and height of 196 children from 12 randomly selected preschools and kindergartens were measured and recorded. In Sydney, data on weight and height of 325 children attending four early childhood centres were extracted from client records. The two studies used the age and gender-specific body mass index criteria for classifying overweight and obesity. The prevalence of Melbourne preschool-aged children considered overweight was 15.3% for boys and 17.3% for girls, with a further 7.1% of boys and 8.2% of girls considered obese. In Sydney, the proportion of children considered overweight was 15.3% for boys and 26.3% for girls. An additional 8.7% of boys and 8% of girls were considered obese. There is some evidence that childhood obesity may begin in the preschool years. Intervention programs targeting obesity should be considered for families with preschool-aged children in urban Australia.</abstract>

    <title>Evaluation of the soil penetration resistance along a transect to determine the loosening depth</title>
    <abstract>The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of soil strength (measured as cone index, CI) along a 600 m transect and to determine the soil loosening depth necessary to eliminate zones with soil strengths exceeding a threshold value down to a depth of 0.6 m. The transect was located at a site in a glacial drift area which was characterised by sandy deposits overlying boulder clay. A tractor-mounted multi-penetrometer array consisting of four hydraulically driven single vertical penetrometers was used to determine CI at 1-m sampling intervals as a measure of penetration resistance. The spatial fluctuation of the CI readings in general and that of repeatedly averaged readings along the transect was examined. Furthermore, the relationships between the penetration resistance of several soil layers and the relationships between the CI of single penetrometers were identified. Averaged CI values over 5-m intervals were used to determine the depth of soil loosening required. By using various data sub-sets based on the averaged data of the four array mounted penetrometers and simulating several different sampling intervals, treatment intervals and threshold values of soil strength, a sampling interval of about 10 m proved to be sufficiently accurate to determine the loosening depth required.</abstract>

    <title>Site-specific production functions for variable rate corn nitrogen fertilization</title>
    <abstract>Specific recommendations for variable rate nitrogen (VRN) fertilization in corn (Zea mays L.) are required to realize the potential environmental and economic benefits of this technology. However, recommendations based on algorithms that consider the processes controlling crop response to nitrogen fertilizer (NF) within fields have not yet been developed. The objectives of this study were to develop site-specific corn yield production functions for VRN fertilization and to determine the site-specific variables controlling corn response to NF. The experiments were conducted on eight commercial production fields. Fields were divided into 13-20 sections composed of five plots. Each plot received one NF rate. Site-specific variables included primary and secondary terrain attributes, and the Illinois Soil Nitrogen Test (ISNT). Nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased corn yield and it interacted with at least one site-specific variable. The ISNT was the site-specific variable that interacted with NF in most fields where the CV of ISNT was larger than 10%. The parameter estimates indicate that ISNT had a positive effect on corn yield and that it reduced the response to NF. Terrain attributes also affected corn yield and its response to NF. In general, parameter estimates indicated that well drained areas (i.e. small specific catchment area, moderate slopes) had higher yields and responded less to NF than areas where water is expected to accumulate. These results indicate that terrain attributes as surrogates for soil water content and the ISNT as a measure of soil mineralizable nitrogen are site-specific characteristics that affect corn yield and its response to NF.</abstract>

    <title>Methods to control ectomycorrhizal colonization: effectiveness of chemical and physical barriers</title>
    <abstract>We conducted greenhouse experiments using Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) seedlings where chemical methods (fungicides) were used to prevent ectomycorrhizal colonization of single seedlings or physical methods (mesh barriers) were used to prevent formation of mycorrhizal connections between neighboring seedlings. These methods were chosen for their ease of application in the field. We applied the fungicides, Topas® (nonspecific) and Senator® (ascomycete specific), separately and in combination at different concentrations and application frequencies to seedlings grown in unsterilized forest soils. Additionally, we assessed the ability of hyphae to penetrate mesh barriers of various pore sizes (0.2, 1, 20, and 500 μm) to form mycorrhizas on roots of neighboring seedlings. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was reduced by approximately 55% with the application of Topas® at 0.5 g l-¹. Meshes with pore sizes of 0.2 and 1 μm were effective in preventing the formation of mycorrhizas via hyphal growth across the mesh barriers. Hence, meshes in this range of pore sizes could also be used to prevent the formation of common mycorrhizal networks in the field. Depending on the ecological question of interest, Topas® or the employment of mesh with pore sizes <1 μm are suitable for restricting mycorrhization in the field.</abstract>

    <title>Rooting and vitality of poinsettia cuttings was increased by arbuscular mycorrhiza in the donor plants</title>
    <abstract>In this paper, we provide evidence that the rooting performance of cuttings can be improved by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis of donor plants. Poinsettia stock plants were inoculated with the Glomus intraradices isolate H510 and grown in three different cultivation systems (two organic and one conventional). AM colonization was not related to P availability in the substrate. Decay of the excised cuttings in response to unfavorable postharvest storage conditions was significantly reduced by AM colonization of the stock plants. In most cases, AM significantly promoted the formation of adventitious roots in the stored cuttings. The strongest effect of AM was found when donor plants were grown in a modified organic substrate; then AM-conditioned cuttings showed higher leaf sugar levels and a changed kinetic of carbohydrates during storage. Analyses of N, P, and K in cuttings did not indicate a nutritional effect. The results support the idea that an altered carbohydrate metabolism and plant hormones can contribute to improved rooting performance of cuttings excised from mycorrhizal donor plants.</abstract>

    <abstract>Ascoviruses (AVs) infect larvae of various insect pests belonging to the family Noctuidae. The result of AV infection in the hosts is cleavage of infected cells into vesicles, a unique feature of AV infection. Since insect cell lines facilitate the study of virus life cycles, attempts were made to analyze Heliothis virescens AV (HvAV3e) infection in several cell lines and compare cell pathology to larval infection. In this study, replication and cytopathological effects of HvAV3e on four different cell lines were investigated. HvAV3e replication was confirmed in three noctuid cell lines from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and Helicoverpa zea (BCIRL-Hz-AM1 and FB33). However, the virus did not replicate in the non-noctuid insect cell line from Pieris rapae (Pieridae). Despite replication of the virus in the three permissive cell lines, the cytopathological effects of the virus were significantly different from that of larval infection.</abstract>

    <abstract>Phyllosphere yeasts antagonistic to the infective activity of Botrytis cinerea were isolated from leaves of greenhouse-grown tomatoes and evaluated in a detached leaf assay for their ability to suppress grey mould. Nine of 30 recovered yeast isolates were found to reduce a disease index by >90% when compared to an untreated control. In greenhouse experiments, the yeast isolate Rhodotorula glutinis Y-44 was the most efficient in controlling grey mould of tomato plants. In further experiments in greenhouse-grown tomato plants the effectiveness of R. glutinis Y-44 was compared with two commercial fungicides. It was demonstrated that R. glutinis Y-44 was as effective as fungicides in controlling the pathogen. Moreover, the population of R. glutinis Y-44 was monitored for 8 weeks after application on tomato plants. The isolate successfully colonized the plant surface, although the population decreased by 10-fold 8 weeks after application. Since B. cinerea is also a major post-harvest pathogen for tomato fruits, the ability of R. glutinis Y-44, to protect artificially infected wounded tomato fruits was also tested. It was shown that R. glutinis Y-44 was able to reduce by 50% the percentage of infected wounds compared to the untreated controls.</abstract>

    <title>Degradation of Tributyltin in Microcosm Using Mekong River Sediment</title>
    <abstract>The degradation of tributyltin (TBT) and changes of bacterial number and community structures were investigated in microcosms using the sediment collected from the Mekong River, Vietnam. Concentrations of TBT in sediments were less than 0.62 ng/g (dry wt), lower than those reported from other areas. TBT-resistant bacteria were found in the three sampling sites, and the occurrence rates were 11-16% out of the total viable count. In this microcosm experiment, initial concentration of TBT [1.0-1.4 μg/g (dry wt)] decreased to 0.6 μg/g (dry wt) during 150 days, whereas that in the control microcosm with autoclaved sediment did not change, indicating that Mekong River sediment contains high TBT-degrading activity by microorganisms. The occurrence of TBT-resistant bacteria and the bacterial community structures monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were almost the same between test and control groups, indicating that the addition of TBT had little influence on microbial community structure. Mekong River sediment seems to have a stable microbial community against TBT pollution.</abstract>

    <title>Comparison of Bacterial Communities in New England Sphagnum Bogs Using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP)</title>
    <abstract>Wetlands are major sources of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases released during microbial degradation. Despite the fact that decomposition is mainly driven by bacteria and fungi, little is known about the taxonomic diversity of bacterial communities in wetlands, particularly Sphagnum bogs. To explore bacterial community composition, 24 bogs in Vermont and Massachusetts were censused for bacterial diversity at the surface (oxic) and 1 m (anoxic) regions. Bacterial diversity was characterized by a terminal restriction fragment length (T-RFLP) fingerprinting technique and a cloning strategy that targeted the 16S rRNA gene. T-RFLP analysis revealed a high level of diversity, and a canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated marked similarity among bogs, but consistent differences between surface and subsurface assemblages. 16S rDNA sequences derived from one of the sites showed high numbers of clones belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria group. Several other phyla were represented, as well as two Candidate Division-level taxonomic groups. These data suggest that bog microbial communities are complex, possibly stratified, and similar among multiple sites.</abstract>

In this paper, the characteristics of down- and upward short wave radiation fluxes, down- and upward long wave radiation fluxes, net radiation flux, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat in the areas of CAMP/Tibet [coordinated enhansive observating period (CEOP) Asian-Australia Monsoon Project (CAMP) in Tibetan Plateau] are analyzed. Some new concepts about the characteristics of radiation flux budget and land surface energy budget are obtained.</abstract>

    <title>A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy</title>
    <abstract>It is generally accepted that the functional compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells is reflected by the differential occurrence of proteins in their compartments. The location and physiological function of a protein are closely related; local information of a protein is thus crucial to understanding its role in biological processes. The visualization of proteins residing on intracellular structures by fluorescence microscopy has become a routine approach in cell biology and is increasingly used to assess their colocalization with well-characterized markers. However, image-analysis methods for colocalization studies are a field of contention and enigma. We have therefore undertaken to review the most currently used colocalization analysis methods, introducing the basic optical concepts important for image acquisition and subsequent analysis. We provide a summary of practical tips for image acquisition and treatment that should precede proper colocalization analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the application and feasibility of colocalization tools for various biological colocalization situations and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We have created a novel toolbox for subcellular colocalization analysis under ImageJ, named JACoP, that integrates current global statistic methods and a novel object-based approach.</abstract>

    <title>Domestic Environmental Benefits of China's Energy-Related CDM Potential</title>
    <abstract>We estimate the domestic environmental and health benefits of exploiting China's energy-related CDM potential. Exploiting the CDM potential may save between 3,000 and 40,000 lives annually. Additional gains are estimated to reach upwards from 1 billion RMB annually. The key to these gains is the fact that actions and measures to reduce CO₂ emissions also reduce emissions of TSP and SO₂. In our estimate, exploiting the CDM-potential will cut SO₂-emissions by between one-half and three million tons annually. To arrive at these conclusions we synthesize a significant body of recent research on co-benefits of climate abatement in China.</abstract>

    <title>A Sustainability Framework for Enhancing the Long-Term Success of Lulucf Projects</title>
    <abstract>Collateral impacts of land use and land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects, especially those concerning social and environmental aspects, have been recognized as important by the Marrakech Accords. The same applies to the necessity of assessing and, if possible, of quantifying the magnitude of these impacts. This article aims to define, clarify and structure the relevant social, economic and environmental issues to be addressed and to give examples of indicators that ought to be included in the planning, design, implementation, monitoring, and ex post evaluation of LULUCF projects. This is being done by providing a conceptual framework for the assessment of the sustainability of such projects that can be used as a checklist when dealing with concrete projects, and that in principle is applicable to both Annex I and non-Annex I countries. Finally, a set of recommendations is provided to further develop and promote the proposed framework.</abstract>

    <title>Heavy metal pollution affects dawn singing behaviour in a small passerine bird.</title>
    <abstract>Although several studies have suggested that behavioural measures may be more comprehensive than other biomarkers for indicating an organism's health or welfare, this has rarely been investigated in free-living terrestrial vertebrates. Here we examine the expression of dawn singing behaviour in a free-living small songbird in relation to environmental pollution. We compared the singing behaviour of male great tits Parus major inhabiting an area extremely polluted with heavy metals with that of males inhabiting areas of low(er) pollution (at 4 and 20 km distance from the pollution source). Males at the most polluted site had a significantly smaller repertoire size than males at the two other sites. They also produced a significantly lower total amount of song during the dawn chorus than the males at a distance of 4 km from the pollution source. Our results, although non-experimental and obtained in field conditions, strongly suggest that heavy metal pollution might affect the expression of singing behaviour. Taking into account that previous studies were not able to detect clear, straightforward differences between the health of great tits at the most polluted site and at 4 km distance from the pollution source, our results suggest that the singing behaviour of great tits may be a useful indicator of environmental stress at the population level.</abstract>

    <title>Production of 1,3-Propanediol by Clostridium butyricum VPI 3266 in continuous cultures with high yield and productivity</title>
    <abstract>The effects of dilution rate and substrate feed concentration on continuous glycerol fermentation by Clostridium butyricum VPI 3266, a natural 1,3-propanediol producer, were evaluated in this work. A high and constant 1,3-propanediol yield (around 0.65 mol/mol), close to the theoretical value, was obtained irrespective of substrate feed concentration or dilution rate. Improvement of 1,3-propanediol volumetric productivity was achieved by increasing the dilution rate, at a fixed feed substrate concentration of 30, 60 or 70 g l-¹. Higher 1,3-propanediol final concentrations and volumetric productivities were also obtained when glycerol feed concentration was increased from 30 to 60 g l-¹, at D=0.05-0.3 h-¹, and from 60-70 g l-¹, at D=0.05 and 0.1 h-¹·30 g l-¹ of 1,3-propanediol and the highest reported value of productivity, 10.3 g l-¹ h-¹, was achieved at D=0.30 h-¹ and 60 g l-¹ of feed glycerol. A switch to an acetate/butyrate ratio higher than one was observed for 60 g l-¹ of feed glycerol and a dilution rate higher than 0.10 h-¹; moreover, at D=0.30 h-¹ 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde accumulation was observed for the first time in the fermentation broth of C. butyricum.</abstract>

    <title>Biological deinking of inkjet-printed paper using Vibrio alginolyticus and its enzymes</title>
    <abstract>Recycling of office waste paper (photocopy, inkjet, and laser prints) is a major problem due to difficulty in removal of nonimpact ink. Biological deinking of office waste paper is reported using several microorganisms and their enzymes. We report here deinking and decolorization of the dislodged ink particles from inkjet printed paper pulp by a marine bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus isolate no. NIO/DI/32, obtained from marine sediments. Decolorization of this pulp was achieved within 72 h by growing the bacterium in the pulp of 3-6% consistency suspended in seawater. Immobilized bacterial cells in sodium alginate beads were also able to decolorize this pulp within 72 h. The cell-free culture supernatant of the bacterium grown in nutrient broth was not effective in deinking. However, when the culture was grown in nutrient broth supplemented with starch or Tween 80, the cell-free culture supernatant could effectively deink and decolorize inkjet-printed paper pulp within 72 h at 30°C. The culture supernatant of V. alginolyticus grown in the presence of starch or Tween 80 showed 49 U ml-¹ and 33 U ml-¹ amylase and lipase activities, respectively. Dialysis of these culture supernatants through 10 kDa cut-off membrane resulted in a 35-40% reduction in their efficiency in decolorizing the pulp. It appears that amylase and lipase effectively help in dislodging the ink particles from the inkjet printed-paper pulp. We hypothesize that the bacterium might be inducing the formation of low molecular weight free radicals in the culture medium, which might be responsible for decolorization of the pulp.</abstract>

    <title>Stem taper functions for maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) in Galicia (Northwestern Spain)</title>
    <abstract>A total of 31 taper functions from 3 different groups of models (single, segmented and variable-form taper functions) were fitted to diameter-height data from 203 Pinus pinaster trees sampled across even-aged stands in Galicia (northwestern Spain). Most of the taper functions analyzed showed problems of multicollinearity as indicated by the condition number. A second-order autoregressive CAR(2) error process was incorporated into the models to minimize the effect of autocorrelation inherent in the longitudinal data used, and to provide valid tests of significance for model parameter estimates. In general, variable-form taper functions provided the most accurate predictions. The flexibility and predictive performance of the variable-form model developed by Kozak (For Chron 80(4):507-515, 2004) indicated its usefulness for estimating diameter at a specific height, merchantable volume, and total volume of Maritime pine in the study area.</abstract>

    <title>Neural networks for assessing the risk of windthrow on the forest division level: a case study in southwest Germany</title>
    <abstract>The paper describes a methodological approach for risk assessment on the forest division level especially in secondary coniferous forests based on regular management records using an artificial neural network (ANN). Database of the investigation are records of salvage cuttings mainly due to storm damage and of inventory data for a State Forest of the South Black Forest, Germany in the period from 1976 to 1985. The data on salvage cuttings were recorded on the forest division level, an area with a mean size of 30 ha that contains several forest stands. The database has partly to be considered as rather unsharp or fuzzy and makes classical statistical analysis very difficult. The paper provides a description of the methodological approach, especially of the structure of the neural network, a three layered feed forward network with backpropagation algorithm and the tangens hyperbolicus as activation function. First experiences with the application of the method were made by predicting the risk for storm damage within one decade for a state forest containing 139 divisions (around 4,000 ha). Two randomly selected training sets were presented to the network and produced a very satisfying learning effect. The validation for two test sets showed a good result for the lower damage class and a tendency for overestimating the damage in the higher damage class. A classical logistic regression model that was compared to the ANN systematically underestimated the damage for the training and test data sets.</abstract>

    <title>Humoral response of chicken infected with the microsporidium Encephalitozoon hellem</title>
    <abstract>Chicken (Gallus gallus) were used as the experimental model for study of immune response against the microsporidium Encephalitozoon hellem (Didier et al., J Inf Dis 163:617-621, 1991) infection in birds. Two-day-old chicken were infected perorally or intraperitoneally with a dose of 10⁷ spores of E. hellem. The anti-E. hellem immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgY, and IgM antibody responses in sera and dropping sample extracts were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results have shown specific antibody production in sera and intestinal secretions of infected birds. Chicken inoculated perorally developed the lowest antibody response. Microsporidian spores were not identified in the smears from cloacal swab samples of individual chicken. Intestinal segment cultures of perorally infected chicken cultivated in vitro showed the highest production of specific IgY and IgA antibodies in jejunum segments. In the further course of infection, the colon produced the highest amount of IgA, and the ileum and colon produced the highest amount of IgY.</abstract>

    <title>Field studies on endoparasites of Thoroughbred foals on seven farms in central Kentucky in 2004</title>
    <abstract>Fecal samples (n=1,584) for a parasite study were collected from Thoroughbred foals (n=349), 28 to 330 days old, on seven farms in central Kentucky during 49 monthly trips from May to October, November, or December 2004. The main purpose was to determine possible drug resistance of ascarids, also of strongyles, to ivermectin (IVM) and other commercially available compounds [fenbendazole, moxidectin (MOX), oxibendazole (OBZ), and pyrantel pamoate]. In addition, interest was on prevalence of foal parasites. Qualitative data were obtained by recording presence or absence of ascarid and strongyle eggs in feces from 7 to 25 days after treatment of some of the foals. None of the compounds completely eliminated ascarid eggs in feces of all foals posttreatment. Activity on ascarids was significantly the highest for OBZ and lowest for IVM. Activity on strongyles was significantly higher for IVM and MOX than for the other compounds. Prevalence (mean percentage of foals infected) was recorded for eggs of Parascaris equorum (39%), of strongyles (32%), and of Strongyloides westeri (2%) and oocysts of Eimeria leuckarti (28%) in feces of foals. One or more foals had infections of P. equorum on six farms (86%), strongyles on seven farms (100%), S. westeri on two farms (29%), and E. leuckarti on six farms (86%). The oldest foal infected with E. leuckarti was 301 days of age. Comparison was made on the prevalence of parasites in foals on five of the same farms in the 2004 study, which were part of a similar 14-farm project in 2003 (Lyons and Tolliver in Parasitol Res (2004) 92:400-404).</abstract>

    <title>Application of real-time RT-PCR for the quantitation and competitive replication study of H5 and H7 subtype avian influenza virus</title>
    <abstract>Avian influenza (AI) viruses are endemic in wild birds and if transmitted to poultry can cause serious economic losses. In the study of AI, the quantitation of virus shed from infected birds is valuable in pathogenesis studies and to determine the effectiveness of vaccines, and is performed routinely by cultivation of virus containing samples using embryonating chicken eggs (ECE) and expressed by 50% egg infectious dose (EID50). Although, this assay is accurate and is the standard test for infectious virus titration, the method is laborious, requires a large number of ECE, and takes at least 7 days to determine results. In this study, a one-tube hydrolysis fluorescent probe based real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) was applied for the quantitation of AI virus and compared with conventional virus titration method. A strong positive correlation was observed between the amount of RNA determined by quantitative RRT-PCR and the EID50s determined by conventional methods. This RRT-PCR test was further applied in the study of competitive replication of co-infected H5 and H7 subtype viruses in chickens. Using hemagglutinin subtype specific probes, we were able to determine the amount of individual subtype virus, which could not have easily been done with conventional methods. This RRT-PCR based quantitation of AI virus, which is specific, sensitive, easy to perform, and rapid, will be useful for virological, pathogenesis, and protection studies.</abstract>

    <title>Improving yields and reducing risks in pearl millet farming in the African Sahel.</title>
    <abstract>Over 40 years of research on pearl millet farming in the semi-arid Sahel has not been extended to farmers successfully. The recommendations for proper planting density, inorganic fertiliser application, and short cycle varieties have not been followed by the farmers. The difference in priorities between researchers, who aim to improve yields in average years, and Sahelian farmers, who seek to reduce the frequency of crop failure, could explain the non-adoption of most innovations because the risks of yield losses were not reduced. Innovations and conventional techniques were tested in farmers' fields in Niger over 5 years in two experiments. The first experiment (3 years) compared four hill densities with and without nitrogen and phosphorus (NP) fertilisation. Soil water was monitored with neutron probes. Grain yield, biomass, and tillering were modified profoundly by rainfall distribution, and treatment effects were statistically significant in two out of three years. The conventional low density planting did not produce high yields as frequently as higher densities under favourable conditions; however there was less crop failure under harsh conditions with low density farming, although lower average grain yields were realised. Risks to crop yields were reduced mainly by the staggered development of main stem and tiller panicles. The tiller contribution to yields was reduced from about 60% in conventional wide spacing (5000 hills ha-1) to 20% in recommended spacing (10,000 hills ha-1). The second experiment (3 years) compared NP fertilisation versus no inorganic inputs in 11 fields of variable nutrient status under conventional low density planting. Grain yields improved with NP application in all fields because of the increase in panicle number. But contribution of the tillers to yields did not increase in the poorest soils because higher yields were obtained by reducing the number of sterile hills. This study allowed the grouping of farming practices according to their potential to improve yields or reduce risks. The practices that increased yields and reduced risks were: conventional low density planting with or without inorganic fertiliser, planting of late and early maturing varieties during the same season, and manuring. The practices that increased yields but did not reduce risks were: dense planting with inorganic fertilisation, mono-cropping of early maturing varieties, and incorporating inorganic fertiliser in very poor soils. Under the marginal conditions of the Sahel, farmers are likely to accept practices that increase yields and reduce risks.</abstract>

    <abstract>This article presents an econometric analysis of the effects of price floors on price dynamics and price volatility in a multimarket context. We investigate the implications of a government price-support program providing a censoring mechanism to the price determination process. The analysis uses a dynamic multivariate Tobit model under time-varying volatility. The model is applied to the U.S. dairy markets with a special focus on the effects of government price-support programs in a period of market liberalization. The econometric analysis provides useful information on the multimarket effects of price supports on price dynamics and price volatility.</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of this study is to determine the potential for using spatial econometric analysis of combine yield monitor data to estimate the site-specific crop response functions. The specific case study is for site-specific nitrogen (N) application to corn production in Argentina. Spatial structure of the yield data is modeled with landscape variables, spatially autoregressive error and groupwise heteroskedasticity. Results suggest that N response differs by landscape position, and that site-specific application may be modestly profitable. Profitability depends on the model specification used, with all spatial models consistently indicating profitability, whereas the nonspatial models do not.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of cork-stripping damage on diameter growth of Quercus suber L.</title>
    <abstract>The Mediterranean cork oak (Quercus suber L.) agro-forestry system is oriented towards cork production, with cork being extracted from tree stem and branches as planks by cutting with an axe and stripping off. The effect of damage to the tree during cork stripping was studied in cork oaks, weakened by wounding, by following the diameter growth and its seasonality during a 9-year production cycle, and comparing them with healthy cork oaks. Tree wounding decreased diameter growth during the following cycle, e.g. 8.5 mm a(-1) and 9.8 mm a(-1) for weakened and healthy trees, respectively, mostly in the 2 years immediately following the cork stripping. The beginning of annual growth in spring and the occurrence of the highest increments in June-August were delayed by about 1 month in the weakened trees. The cork produced by weakened trees was reduced by 13 per cent in thickness, with average cork ring widths of 3.3 mm a(-1) vs. 3.8 mm a(-1) for healthy trees.</abstract>

    <title>Estimation of deforestation rates in Great Britain.</title>
    <abstract>Estimates of national deforestation rates are required for reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol. The most direct record of deforestation in Great Britain (GB) is provided by Forestry Commission (FC) unconditional felling licences, which give a value of approximately 500 ha a(-1) for recent years. This probably represents a minimum, as unlicensed felling will also occur but to an unknown extent. The deforestation rate can be estimated indirectly by constructing a forest area budget, assuming deforestation is the residual term remaining after the observed change in forest area is subtracted from the recorded area of newly planted forest. Independent estimates of the total GB forest area can be obtained from the FC Woodland Census, the FC National Inventory of Woodland & Trees, and the Countryside Survey. An additional independent source of estimates of the total Scottish forest area is provided by the National Countryside Monitoring Scheme (NCMS). The observed increase in total area in these data does not differ significantly from the recorded planting rate, and a statistically significant deforestation rate was not detectable. An alternative approach is to use national survey schemes, in which repeated surveys of land use are made in a set of permanent plots. Deforestation rate can be calculated as the sum of transitions from all forest classes to all non-forest classes. Both the NCMS and the Countryside Survey can be used in this way. The NCMS survey can be scaled to give a GB deforestation rate of approximately 1000 ha a(-1), whilst the Countryside Survey gives a value of approximately 20000 ha a(-1). The NCMS value is thought to be more reliable, as the afforestation rate estimated in this way agrees closely with FC figures, whilst the Countryside Survey substantially overestimates afforestation. National mapping data from the Ordnance Survey (OS) can be used in a similar way and, as the whole country is covered by a rolling programme of surveys, sampling bias should be removed. These data show a similar temporal pattern to the felling licence data, but with considerably higher deforestation rates, with a mean of 4059 ha a(-1) and a peak at over 7000 ha a(-1). However, these data suggest that there was substantial conversion of forest to agricultural land (62 per cent of the total deforested area). It seems unlikely that extensive unlicensed felling would have occurred for expanding agricultural land, when there has been little economic or policy incentives to do so, and we therefore suspect that these data may overestimate rural deforestation. The best estimate of the recent deforestation rate may be obtained by combining the data from the FC unconditional felling licences (accounting for conversions to rural uses) with the OS estimate of deforestation for non-rural uses which do not generally require a felling licence. This gives a value of 1375 ha a(-1).</abstract>

    <title>The influence of stand development process on the height and volume growth of dominant Fagus sylvatica L. s.l. trees in the central Rhodope Mountains of north-eastern Greece.</title>
    <abstract>This study was conducted in pure and mixed Fagus sylvatica L. s.l. stands in the central Rhodope Mountains of north-eastern Greece. Forty dominant beech trees were cut and analysed using a stem analysis technique. The trees came from two different groups (structural types) of stands. The first structural type consists of pure Fagus sylvatica L. s.l. stands and the second consists of Fagus sylvatica-Pinus sylvestris L. stands. In each structural type some stands are located in good productivity sites and others in medium-productivity sites. Within each structural type the structure of the stands was the result of the same development process. The development process of pure beech stands was entirely different from the development process of beech-pine stands. The main results of this research indicate that the stand development process, without any interaction with site, influences the height and volume growth of dominant beech trees, at least up to the age of 50 years. The growth environment of Fagus sylvatica-Pinus sylvestris stands, as a result of their development process, gives a strong competitive advantage to dominant beech trees, to such a degree that the dominant beech trees of Fagus sylvatica-Pinus sylvestris stands, in sites of intermediate productivity, exhibit practically the same height and at least the same volume, on average, as those of pure Fagus sylvatica stands of good productivity sites, at least up to the age of 50 years.</abstract>

    <title>A review of the history, definitions and methods of continuous cover forestry with special attention to afforestation and restocking.</title>
    <abstract>Continuous cover forestry (CCF) is not a new idea in forest management but there has been renewed interest in it for the potential it has to meet the sustainability requirements which are part of the Rio/Helsinki process and certification. Broadly speaking CCF includes those silvicultural systems which involve continuous and uninterrupted maintenance of forest cover and which avoid clearcutting. However, there is considerable confusion with regard to terms and definitions and even the phrase continuous cover forestry is not universally known. CCF systems are being introduced throughout Europe, where there is emphasis on the direct transformation of existing even-aged plantations to some form of mixed, uneven-aged woodland. There is also the opportunity to establish such woodlands either at re-stocking or when afforesting former agricultural land but so far there has been little discussion of the methods that can be used to do this. One approach would be to use nurse crops to aid establishment of desired species, especially where there are difficult site conditions or the trees naturally require cover for optimal growth. The use of nurse crops is already a familiar part of forest practice and has found various applications in Britain, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe. This paper outlines the historical roots of continuous cover forestry, discusses definitions and features of the current debate and explores potential silvicultural methods with special attention to the direct establishment of mixed forest stands through afforestation and restocking.</abstract>

    <abstract>The study investigated the hypotheses that Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) sapling growth is reduced by the occurrence of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) through either resource competition or allelopathy. A field experiment was established with a randomized block design and five treatments including one control in an uneven-aged Norway spruce forest. Bilberry stems were cut in a 0.56 m radius (1 m2) around each treated spruce sapling, and removed or left lying. In the following year treatments were repeated on half of the spruce saplings. Sapling height increments were measured for six growing seasons after applying the treatments. Saplings reacted with a decrease in height increment compared with the control during the first and second year after applying treatments, and had height increments similar to the control the following three years. No significant differences were found between treatments removing or leaving bilberry cuttings. The results did not support the hypotheses.</abstract>

    <title>Structure and composition of pole-stage stands developed in an ancient wood pasture in central Spain.</title>
    <abstract>El Chaparral de Montejo is a woodland area situated in central Spain containing a large group of temperate species that since the Middle Ages has been subject to communal use for grazing like many other European forests. We studied the characteristics of former wood-pasture and the pole-stage stands developed close to ancient trees in three representative stands consisting of Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica. The Fagus sylvatica stand proved to be the best regeneration site because of its deep soil and greater number of ancient trees, which provided more seeds and tree cover, both favouring the development of seedlings in this stand. However, the poorer soil conditions and the dense layer of herbaceous vegetation in the Quercus pyrenaica stand have inhibited the establishment of the more water-demanding temperate species. It is suggested that past irregular exploitation conducted to a mosaic distribution of forest communities explain the differences in structure and composition found in the three stands studied. The stand occupied by the more xerophilous species, Quercus pyrenaica, was more affected by the reduction of forest productivity in the past. Nowadays the patterns of pole-stage stand diversity reveal the future expected changes. The higher diversity of saplings in the Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica stands reveal better conditions in the understorey than those existing in their early developmental stages, especially for the two shade-tolerant species, beech and holly. On the contrary the lower diversity of saplings in the Fagus sylvatica stand is due to the low light levels in the understorey which gradually cause the disappearance of shade-intolerant species.</abstract>

    <title>Strong phylogeographic relationships among three goat breeds from the Canary Islands.</title>
    <abstract>We partially sequenced the mitochondrial D-loop region in 47 individuals from eleven Spanish and foreign goat breeds. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences allowed us to identify a particular D-loop haplotype shared by individuals from the Palmera, Majorera and Tinerfena Canarian breeds. Genotyping of 281 goats from 17 different breeds by PCR-Hpall RFLP evidenced that the geographical distribution of this haplotype is restricted to the Canary Islands. This ancestral mitochondrial haplotype might originate in the domestic goat herds brought by the native Canarian inhabitants approximately 3000 years ago. Although we observed other miscellaneous D-loop haplotypes in the Palmera, Majorera and Tinerfena breeds, any of them allowed us to group individuals from these three populations in a single cluster, a feature that suggests that these haplotypes might have diverse origins. The remarkable degree of phylogeographic structure of the Canary goat breeds with regard to other Spanish and foreign populations might be attributed to the isolation of these breeds in the Canary Islands for approximately 2500 years, without exposure to the migratory movements and commercial trading events that probably affected the genesis of most domestic goat breeds worldwide. The Canarian D-loop haplotype can be efficiently genotyped by using DNA isolated from milk and cheese samples, which paves the way for the future establishment of a Canary breed identity test for these dairy products.</abstract>

    <title>Increasing magnesium intakes in relation to magnesium absorption in dry cows.</title>
    <abstract>Earlier studies with temporarily isolated rumen of heifers show saturation kinetics of Mg efflux across the rumen wall. Therefore, we hypothesized that high Mg intakes would not further increase the rate of Mg absorption in cows. To test our hypothesis, six ruminally fistulated non-pregnant dry cows were given diets with different Mg concentrations in a 6 x 6 Latin square design. Desired concentrations of Mg were attained by adding MgO to the basal diet and the Mg concentrations in the total rations were 3.8, 6.4, 9.1, 11.8, 14.1 and 17.3 g Mg/kg dry matter, which provided Mg intakes of 27.1, 44.6, 64.6, 83.5, 100.4 and 124.3 g/d, respectively. Increasing Mg intakes were associated with increased (P<0.001) faecal Mg excretion. However, apparent Mg absorption expressed as g/d was not significantly different for Mg intakes from 100.4 to 124.3 g/d while Mg absorption expressed as a proportion of intake was not significantly different for Mg intakes ranging from 64.6 to 124.3 g/d. Mg concentrations in rumen fluid after feeding increased (P<0.001) with increasing Mg intakes. Apparent absorption of Mg appeared to become saturated at a ruminal Mg concentration of 17.5 mM (Mg intake of 83.5 g/d). Group-mean post-feeding concentrations of Mg and Na in rumen fluid were significantly correlated (Pearson's r=-0.96; P=0.003, n=6). This study showed that under conditions of practical dairy cow feeding, Mg absorption was maximal at Mg intakes greater than or equal to 84 g/d.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of different milking intervals on the composition of cisternal and alveolar milk in dairy cows.</title>
    <abstract>Effects of six different milking intervals on the distribution of milk between cistern and alveoli were studied in a randomized, incomplete Latin Square experiment with four lactating Holstein cows. Cisternal and alveolar milk was measured by udder quarter at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24-h intervals with a 3-d interperiod of regular milking. Cisternal milk was evacuated using a cannula after injection of an oxytocin-receptor blocking agent, followed by an injection of oxytocin to remove the alveolar fraction. Milk samples from each fraction and quarter were collected for analysis. Cisternal and alveolar milk increased with milking interval and represented on average 30 and 70% of the milk stored in the udder, respectively. Fat content in alveolar milk remained constant during the first 16 h, increasing rapidly thereafter, reaching its maximum at 24 h (6.95%). Fat content in cisternal milk decreased with milking interval and reached its minimum at 24 h (0.96%). Total fat yield tended to increase for cisternal milk with longer milking intervals, but it increased markedly for alveolar milk, showing that fat globules did not pass freely from alveoli to cistern between milkings. Milk protein content was greater in rear quarters than in front quarters for both milk fractions. Milk protein content increased in the cisternal milk fraction and tended to increase in the alveolar milk fraction with longer milking intervals, but values did not differ between cisternal and alveolar fractions or between front and rear quarters. Total protein yield increased with milking interval in both fractions, indicating that casein micelles passed more freely than fat globules from the alveolar to the cisternal compartment. In conclusion, the short-term effects of milking intervals in milk composition were explained by the changes observed in alveolar and cisternal milk ratio.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of subclinical intramammary infection on somataic cell counts, NAGase activity and gross composition of goats' milk.</title>
    <abstract>The study was aimed at identifying the pathogens causing subclinical udder infections in representative Israeli dairy goat herds and determining their effect on milk quality. Five hundred goats in ten flocks of various breeds and crossbreeds were surveyed. Of the 500 goats, 13.4% were in their first lactation, 36.4% were in their second lactation and 50.2% were in their third or higher lactation. Percentages of udder halves with subclinical intramammary infection in the flocks ranged from 35 to 71%. The effect of the bacteriological infection on somatic cells count (SCC) was significant (P<0.001). Various species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), mainly Staphylococcus caprae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, were the main pathogens in infected udder halves. Lactation number did not significantly influence either infection rate of udder halves or SCC, although the percentage of udder halves with no bacteriological findings was higher at the first lactation than at the third lactation. Milk composition (fat, protein and lactose) varied among flocks, with lower mean total protein in uninfected halves than in infected ones and higher lactose in uninfected than infected halves.</abstract>

    <title>Row configuration in rainfed cotton systems: modification of the OZCOT simulation model.</title>
    <abstract>Over the last 10 years, there has been a rapid expansion of rainfed cotton production in Australia. The majority of this area has used "skip row" configurations in which certain rows in the crop are not sown with the aim of providing a slowly available supply of soil moisture during periods of low rainfall. In the past, the OZCOT cotton crop simulation model has been used with long-term climate records to assess the impact of different management strategies for irrigated cotton production and to study the prospects for rainfed cotton production in the major cotton growing regions. In this paper, we present modifications made to OZCOT to better accommodate skip row. First, a simple procedure previously used to approximate light interception of row crops was assessed for its ability to enhance the capability of OZCOT to simulate skip row configurations and second, a modification to allow for the possibility that water in the skip is not as freely available as the water in the plant row was also explored. Including modifications to allow for differences in soil water extraction significantly improved predictions of crop yield for cotton in skip row configurations across a number of locations in the Eastern Australian cotton producing regions, but modifications to account for light interception in row configurations reduced the ability of the model to simulate skip row cotton yields. The modified model gave reasonable predictions of yield for solid planted and skip row crops. The performance was within the range of results published for solid planted crops over a range of nitrogen and irrigation treatments and planting dates. The model's simulation of skip row yields when compared to solid planted crops grown under the same conditions, reflected the relationships seen in the measured data and those published in the industry literature.</abstract>

    <title>Analysing farming systems with Data Envelopment Analysis: citrus farming in Spain.</title>
    <abstract>Farming systems in the Mediterranean agricultural areas of Spain are frequently characterised by the small size of the production units and a widespread strategy of externalisation of many growing tasks which could be seen as a way of allowing farms to remain competitive. In this paper, we suggest Data Envelopment Analysis as an appropriate analytical tool to explore the possibilities of short-term viability of individual farms, after eliminating current inefficient practices. From a sample of Spanish citrus farms, we identify the efficient production units that determine the technological or best practice frontier, and we compare their characteristics with those of the average farm. Best practice farms have higher yields than the average farm and are also further advanced in the process of substituting wage-earning labour for family labour. Cutting the employment of the household's labour on its own farm is linked to a strategy of externalisation of citrus growing tasks, in an attempt to surmount the problems posed by the small average size of farms. Finally, we compute an overall efficiency measure and several indicators of short-run competitiveness that compare the ability of farms to generate net income under both current and efficient production plans. Our results show that there is a substantial fall in the number of farms judged economically non-viable after inefficiency has been removed.</abstract>

    <title>Derivation of steady state herd productivity using stage-structured population models and mathematical programming.</title>
    <abstract>Assessing production efficiency in livestock herds requires the consideration of the effects of herd structure and dynamics on the calculation of efficiency measures. Steady state herd growth models can accommodate for these effects by considering sustained self-recruiting herds, in which herd size and structure are maintained in an equilibrium state over time. Previously published approaches to steady state herd productivity assessment share a number of limitations, e.g., individual animals are classified by their age only; vital parameters such as fecundity, litter size, milk yield, liveweight and liveweight gain are assumed to remain constant throughout the productive lifespan; and the corresponding computer programs lack the capability of choosing the optimal combination of offtake rates across animal classes that leads to a steady state in herd size and structure. In order to refine the concept of steady state herd productivity assessment and improve its flexibility and applicability, a new method of modelling herd dynamics over time and of deriving optimal steady state herd structure and offtake is presented. Herd dynamics are described through a deterministic, stage-structured matrix population model. Stage-structured matrix population models can be generalized to complex life cycles in which individual animals can be classified by several factors other than age. Translating the population dynamics model into a standard non-linear programming problem allows to derive the optimum offtake policy in each stage class. The proposed approach is very general and can easily be applied to a wide range of domestic livestock species and production systems. Combining stage-structured matrix population models with non-linear programming for the determination of optimal steady state herd structure and culling policy removes most limitations of previously published procedures for steady state herd productivity assessment. It is emphasized that the derivation of an optimal culling regime is crucial in comparative studies, in order to obtain a common basis on which alternatives can be compared in terms of a defined production efficiency measure. Biased comparisons may be obtained when using observed or estimated offtake rates for a given management alternative or production system. The reason is that the actual level of productivity achievable under a given management practice is not necessarily identical with the potential productivity achieved when optimal offtake decisions are taken. The choice of culling policy has a great impact on herd dynamics and structure, and needs to be controlled for in comparative assessments.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing the effect of controlled seasonal breeding on steady-state productivity of pastoral goat herds in northern Kenya.</title>
    <abstract>Biological productivity of grazing livestock under semi-arid conditions in northern Kenya is limited by marked seasonal fluctuations in the availability and quality of rangeland resources. With the increasing trend towards sedentarization of pastoral herds and households, the search for an alternative to herd mobility as the most effective adaptive management strategy to attenuate the effects of seasonality in production resources is an issue of growing concern. Using data collected during an experimental study conducted in pastoral goats in northern Kenya, this paper is concerned with the assessment of the effects of controlled seasonal breeding on biological herd productivity. The experiment was conducted over a period of 4 years (1984¡1988) in Isiolo District, northern Kenya. The experimental treatment consisted of six different mating seasons per year, which were replicated three times over the course of the experiment. Assessment of biological productivity was done with a previously developed procedure for steady-state productivity assessments in livestock herds. The criterion used to evaluate biological herd productivity was an energetic efficiency ratio, defined as the total gross energy output of the herd divided by its total metabolizable feed energy requirements at the stationary state. The first hypothesis for testing was that there is an optimal period in a year to which breeding can be restricted to improve overall biological productivity of pastoral goat flocks. Second, a simulated, aseasonally reproducing herd was used as a reference in testing whether controlled breeding is superior to uncontrolled breeding. The general conclusion that emerged from this study is that restricted breeding can effectively be used as a management control to manipulate overall biological herd productivity primarily because of its positive effect on youngstock mortality rates. For achieving maximum energetic efficiency in pastoral goat flocks, breeding should be constrained to the long dry season (June to October). However, when compared to this breeding regime simulated aseasonal breeding performed remarkably well, and more field research is required to ascertain the superiority of controlled over aseasonal breeding.</abstract>

    <title>Divided landbase, overlapping tenures, and fire risk.</title>
    <abstract>The Tardis forest modeling program was used to investigate the effects on timber supply and delivered wood cost of alternative forest tenure policies on a forest management agreement area in northeastern Alberta. Under the current tenure policy (business as usual), the woodlands divisions of one large pulp company and several sawmill companies are responsible for different aspects of planning and forest management on the area. We propose an alternative tenure policy (global planning) whereby one forest management entity is responsible for harvesting timber and delivering it to the various mills. The global planning alternative has several advantages over business as usual, especially for the sawmill companies. With business as usual, the sawmill companies experience shortfalls in timber harvest volume. No shortfall is seen with global planning. Under global planning, delivered wood cost for the sawmill companies is reduced by $2.81 m(-3), on average. Forest fire is an important disturbance affecting timber supply in the area. We examine the joint effects of tenure policy and fire using Monte Carlo simulation. The superiority of global planning is even more apparent with fire incorporated in the model. According to our simulations, many sawmills are very likely to experience persistent sharp decreases in delivered wood volume under business as usual. No such decreases occur under global planning.</abstract>

    <title>Meeting visual quality objectives with operational radial-strip partial cutting in coastal British Columbia: A post-harvest assessment.</title>
    <abstract>The spectacular aesthetic quality of British Columbia's coastal forests has long been an issue for forest managers who must often meet government-imposed visual quality objectives. The result of such objectives within traditional clearcutting silvicultural systems has often been large reductions in otherwise allowable timber removals. In this document we present the results of a post-harvest analysis of an operational trial using radial-strip partial harvesting in a highly visually sensitive area of coastal British Columbia. The analysis confirmed that this innovative form of partial harvesting successfully met visual quality requirements, while concurrently permitting significantly more timber extraction, in an operationally feasible manner, than would have been available under a traditional clearcutting system. We attribute the visual success of this harvest method in a highly visually sensitive area primarily to: (1) the radial pattern of linear clearings where it is not possible to see more than a few cleared strips from any one vantage point; (2) the avoidance of a regular series of parallel geometric clearings; (3) the narrow clearing width, which maximises bare ground screening; (4) feathered edges, which avoided highly contrasting edges of the strips; and (5) green tree retention across age classes. Faller and management experience with this method is expected to result in higher productivity and lower costs in the future. This harvesting technique appears to present a viable alternative to clearcutting for forest managers working in visually sensitive areas. Future work should focus on understanding and determining impacts on other factors such as ecological values and silvicultural goals.</abstract>

    <title>Growth limitations of planted conifers regenerating under Montane Alternative Silviculture Systems (MASS): seven-year results.</title>
    <abstract>As part of the Montane Alternative Silviculture Systems (MASS) project, this study investigates limits on the growth of montane conifers resulting from varying overstory retention under conventional and alternative silvicultural systems. After harvesting treatments were complete in 1993, Abies amabilis (amabilis fir) and Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock) seedlings were spring planted in replicated blocks of shelterwood (SW), patch cut (PC), green tree retention (GT) and clearcut (CC) systems. In addition, sub-plots were established within each silvicultural system in which fertilization (at planting) and vegetation control post-planting treatments were applied alone and in combination to test the extent to which growth limitations are related to nutrient availability and vegetative competition. The impact of overstory retention was most pronounced in the reduced light environment of the SW where height growth after seven years was 26-30% lower in both species compared to the untreated CC, GT and PC systems. Although the effect on growth of both species in the SW was mitigated somewhat by fertilization and vegetation control treatments, amabilis fir did not attain free-to-grow height (1.3 m) regardless of post-planting treatment. Time to free-to-grow height in the more open silvicultural systems was reduced in both fir and hemlock with fertilization and vegetation control alone and in combination, except in the CC where the initial growth response to fertilization alone was diminished by the end of the seven-year study. In contrast to fertilization, the effects of vegetation control on height growth were not apparent until three to five years and seven years after planting in the CC and GT, PC, SW, respectively. Combining vegetation control and fertilization had an additive effect on growth in amabilis fir but not in western hemlock. The effect of silvicultural systems and post-planting treatments on the two species illustrate that both above- and below-ground resource availability (light and nutrients) availability was potentially limiting to growth, particularly in the shelterwood treatment.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of fire severity and salvage logging traffic on regeneration and early growth of aspen suckers in north-central Alberta.</title>
    <abstract>Density and growth of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) were measured in the first two years following wildfire to determine the effects of: 1) fire severity and 2) salvage logging damage on sucker regeneration. Results indicate that stand leaf area was not affected by fire severity, although the greatest number of suckers was produced following high severity burns. In contrast, plots with the highest level of machine disturbance in the salvage-logging study had 60% fewer suckers compared to the non-trafficked plots. These suckers tended to be smaller and had less leaf area than the non-trafficked plots, resulting in a stand leaf area reduction of up to 75%. This suggests that salvage logging could have a negative impact on the future growth and productivity of regenerating aspen stands.</abstract>

    <title>Regeneration imputation models for complex stands of southeastern British Columbia.</title>
    <abstract>Two imputation techniques for predicting natural regeneration in complex stands prevalent in southeastern British Columbia (BC) were compared using data from the Interior Cedar-Hemlock moist warm subzone variant 2 (ICHmw2) in the vicinity of Nelson, BC. Imputation approaches offer advantages over other modeling approaches in that they provide estimates of many variables at one time (multivariate) and there are no assumptions regarding the probability distributions of the variables to be predicted. For the tabular imputation, the average regeneration per ha was calculated for each combination of five site groups, two residual density classes, five time-since-disturbance intervals, species, and height classes. For Most Similar Neighbour (MSN) imputation, data with both regeneration information, and overstory trees and site information (called reference plots) were used to impute regeneration of plots with only overstory trees and site information (called target plots), by selecting the most similar plot. Of the two approaches studied, the MSN approach gave better results than tabular imputation. The tabular imputation approach is simpler to implement, since tables of results can be published and made available for use. However, the MSN software has been made freely available, resulting in greater ease of access.</abstract>

    <title>Regional application of a cropping systems simulation model: crop residue retention in maize production systems of Jalisco, Mexico.</title>
    <abstract>To ensure the productivity of smallholder maize production systems in Central America, increased attention must be paid to conserving soil and water resources. Various stakeholders from national agricultural research services (NARS), networks, non-governmental organizations (NGO's) and research institutes seek to develop and target productivity enhancing resource conserving management practices such as crop residue retention systems. To support this process, a methodology with explicit spatial and temporal dimensions using the DSSAT crop simulation models was developed and applied to the case study of residue retention in maize production systems of Jalisco, Mexico. Systems where crop residues were partially or totally retained were compared with systems with no residue retention. Variables considered included crop production, soil surface runoff water, soil organic carbon and soil organic nitrogen content. Gridded climate surfaces and a range of soil profile scenarios formed the basis of the regional input. Three levels of nitrogen application (0, 150 and 235 kg ha-1) were selected to represent current agronomic practices. Simulation models for maize and fallow were run in sequence for 12 consecutive years. Results demonstrated that soil water holding capacity and topography affected benefits of residue retention much more than nitrogen management. Benefits to maize production from residue retention were found mainly in areas in the northeast of Jalisco and surrounding regions, where low precipitation limits maize production. Reductions in soil surface runoff due to residue retention were most evident in high rainfall areas in the central-east of Jalisco and surrounding regions. Although the effect of soil loss is not accounted for in DSSAT, areas of pronounced soil surface runoff reduction are hypothesized to be areas of productivity gain in the longer term. The assessment provided insight in the regional potential for and the soil and climate conditions under which successful introduction of residue retention in maize cropping systems in Jalisco may be achieved. In combination with socio-economic assessment studies and experimental work, the approach and its results contribute to targeted introduction of new production technologies.</abstract>

    <title>Competence for in vitro bulblet regeneration among eight Lilium genotypes.</title>
    <abstract>Competence for in vitro bulblet regeneration was investigated for eight diverse Lilium genotypes (L. 'Citronella', L. 'Stargazer', L. 'Stones', L. 'Lovely Girl', L. pumilum, L. lancifolium, L. lancifolium 'Orange Star', and L. speciosum var. rubrum). Explants established from bulb scales were cultured on lily bulblet regeneration medium [Murashige and Skoog (1962) modified by reducing the NH4NO3 to 0.825 g.L(-1) and KH2PO4 to 0.170 g.L(-1), and adding (per liter) 30 g sucrose, 0.1 g myoinositol, 0.4 mg thiamine.HCl, 80 mg adenine sulfate, 16 micromolar naphthaleneacetic acid, 2 mL.L(-1) Plant Preservative Mixture (PPM), and 4.5 g.L(-1) AgarGel at pH 5.7] for 8 weeks before transfer to sphagnum peat moss and 4 weeks refrigeration at 5 degrees C in darkness. All genotypes produced bulblets in vitro. However, the response rate varied among genotypes. Explants of Lilium 'Lovely Girl', L. 'Citronella', and L. speciosum var. rubrum were most responsive with approximately equal to 90% producing bulblets. The number of bulblets per responding explant ranged from 5.2 ('Stones') to 2.3 (L. lancifolium). When comparing in vitro and greenhouse bulblet production, about twice as many bulblets were produced by explants in vitro compared to halved scales incubated in the greenhouse. The percentage of responding explants ranged from 33% to 360% greater for six of the genotypes tested when propagated in vitro compared to bulb scales propagated in the greenhouse. Following refrigeration, bulblets were transferred to the greenhouse for sprouting. Over 80% of bulblets obtained from L. 'Citronella', L. lancifolium 'Orange Star', L. lancifolium, and L. 'Stones' sprouted in the greenhouse. This study illustrates that a diverse range of lily species can be successfully propagated in vitro using a single medium formulation and is the first report of bulblet regeneration in vitro for L. 'Citronella', L. 'Stones', L. 'Lovely Girl', and L. lancifolium 'Orange Star'.</abstract>

    <title>Capsaicin content of West Indies hot pepper cultivars using colorimetric and chromatographic techniques.</title>
    <abstract>Colorimetric and chromatographic methods were used to assess capsaicinoid levels in a pungent Caribbean-grown pepper collection comprising 28 accessions of Capsicum chinense and one each of C. annuum and C. frutescens. Two colorimetric methods, one commonly used and attributed to Bajaj (1980) and a modification of the Bajaj method were also compared for congruity and ease of use. Capsaicin content of the cultivars ranged from 37.6 to 497.0 mg/100 g in ripe fruits and 27.8 to 404.5 mg/100 g in green fruit, as determined by Bajaj's method. The corresponding Scoville units of pungency varied from 15,000 to 300,000 for ripe fruit and 7,500 to 270,000 for green fruit. Levels of capsaicin assessed by the modified Bajaj method varied from 15.0 to 402.4 mg/100 g and 13.7 to 356.4 mg/100 g in ripe and green fruit, respectively. On the basis of capsaicin levels assessed by each colorimetric method, the pepper cultivars were differentiated into seven distinct pungency groups. For each method, similar groupings of cultivars were observed for ripe and green fruit and groups of the same numerical designation were mainly comprised of common assessions. These results indicate that the two colorimetric methods generally agree. In contrast, the modified colorimetric method was more efficient than Bajaj's procedure, which required pretreatment of pepper extracts to remove the extracting solvent by evaporation and interfering chromogenic pigments by column chromatography. Phase separation of capsaicin and interfering pigments in pepper extracts by use of dilute acid was the only pretreatment required in the modified Bajaj method before colorimetry. High performance liquid chromatography performed on fruit extracts of the cultivars revealed the presence of the capsaicinoids capsaicin, homocapsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, and homodihydrocapsaicin. Capsaicin and homocapsaicin were detected in greater abundance than dihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin in fruit of all cultivars. Homodihydrocapsaicin was the least abundant of the capsaicinoids and was generally absent in ripe fruit.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing the integrated pest management practices of Pennsylvania nursery operations.</title>
    <abstract>A mail survey was conducted in 2000 to determine awareness and use of integrated pest management (IPM) practices by nurseries in Pennsylvania. Survey participants were randomly selected from the Pennsylvania Dept. of Agriculture, Bureau of Plant Industry, list of certified nurseries. Participants answered questions pertaining to awareness of common practices, frequency that IPM practices were employed, and specifics on monitoring and pest management decision-making processes. Responses were analyzed by Cluster Analysis (SPSS Inc., Chicago), which resulted in the formation of three distinct segments. The segments were labeled "IPM Savvy" (nursery managers who were more likely to employ IPM practices); "Part-time IPMers" (nursery managers who employed some IPM strategies and were interested in future adoption of IPM practices); and "Reluctant IPMers" (nursery managers who were least likely to employ IPM strategies). The "Part-time IPMers" and "Reluctant IPMers" segments represent a substantial part of the industry (51%), who continues to have concerns about the cost, efficacy, and implementation of IPM practices into their businesses. Overall, Pennsylvania growers are aware of IPM practices; however, maintaining permanent records of pests identified and pest management strategies employed remain low. Continued education is warranted to enhance pest monitoring skills and recordkeeping along with demonstrable evidence to the cost effectiveness and marketing benefits that the implementation of IPM practices offer the nursery operators.</abstract>

    <title>Audit of successful weight maintenance in adult and paediatric survivors of thermal injury at a UK regional burn centre.</title>
    <abstract>Background: Thermal injury is associated with significant weight loss, particularly of lean body mass. Weight loss increases the risk of morbidity and increased length of stay (LOS). Appropriate nutrition support can improve these outcomes. The aim of this audit was to evaluate the success of nutrition intervention in minimizing weight loss in adults and children with thermal injury. Method: Patients referred for nutrition support were monitored for weight change during their inpatient care episode. Sixty cases met the study criteria. Admission and discharge weight profiles were identified. The degree of weight loss was calculated. Comparison was made to a recognized standard of acceptable weight loss. Results: On admission five (13.2%) adults were found to be clinically underweight. All children were within the acceptable weight percentile range. Adults demonstrated higher (mean +/- SD) percentage weight loss (8.1 +/- 6.0%) than children (4.7 +/- 4.5%). About 76.7% of all cases met the standard used. More children (95.5%) met the standard than adults (65.8%). Conclusions: Most subjects maintained weight within an acceptable limit during the inpatient episode. Children appeared particularly successful at weight maintenance. Reasons are multifactorial and warrant further investigation.</abstract>

    <title>The health benefits of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: a review of the evidence.</title>
    <abstract>The UK dietary guidelines for cardiovascular disease acknowledge the importance of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) - a component of fish oils - in reducing heart disease risk. At the time, it was recommended that the average n-3 PUFA intake should be increased from 0.1 to 0.2 g day(-1). However, since the publication of these guidelines, a plethora of evidence relating to the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs, in areas other than heart disease, has emerged. The majority of intervention studies, which found associations between various conditions and the intake of fish oils or their derivatives, used n-3 intakes well above the 0.2 g day(-1) recommended by Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA). Furthermore, in 2004, the Food Standards Agency changed its advice on oil-rich fish creating a discrepancy between the levels of n-3 PUFA implied by the new advice and the 1994 COMA guideline. This review will examine published evidence from observational and intervention studies relating to the health effects of n-3 PUFAs, and discuss whether the current UK recommendation for long-chain n-3 PUFA needs to be revisited.</abstract>

    <title>Inter-brand differences in iron content of breakfast cereals and their impact on measurement of iron intake.</title>
    <abstract>Background/aims: Fortified breakfast cereals (FBCs) are an important source of iron in the UK diet. In order to quantify their contribution to iron nutrition, food composition data for these products must be accurate. The very large amount of products available, together with inter-brand differences in iron content mean that discrepancies between the iron content of many FBCs and values in standard food composition databases (FCD) exist. The variation in reported iron contents of FBCs was examined and the impact of this variation on measurement of iron intake using standard food composition tables was investigated. Method: Data on the reported iron content of 128 FBCs were collected. Completed food diaries from 291 participants of the UK Women's Cohort study were used in the analysis. Mean iron intake from a 4-day food diary was calculated using UK food tables' values for FBCs. This was repeated using values reported by the manufacturer for each brand of cereal. The two sets of results were then compared. Results: There is wide variation in iron content of breakfast cereals available in the United Kingdom. Use of FCD values instead of brand-specific values under- or overestimates an individual's iron intake by as much as 28 or 22% respectively. These results suggest that use of FCD values for breakfast cereals is potentially a source of substantial error in measurement of individuals' iron intake. Conclusion: Dietitians need to be aware of inter-brand differences in iron content and formulate advice accordingly. Failure to collect brand-specific data for the iron content of FBCs could lead to measurement error in measuring iron intake in dietary studies.</abstract>

    <title>Clustering of bio-products technologies for zero emissions and eco-efficiency.</title>
    <abstract>To provide a complete wood and non-wood plant biomass refinery into value-added chemicals, materials and biofuels, an integrated processing scheme has been proposed. It allows producing variety of products such as furfural, acetic acid, glucose, bioethanol, levoglucosan, microcrystalline cellulose, fiber materials, plastics, carbon materials, charcoal, activated carbon, and others. A part of the lignocelluloses bulk, producer gas and the unused part of lignin are burned in a boiler house to provide biomass processing with energy, i.e. heat carrier and steam. The first stage will cover the analysis and assessment of material and energy balance of the cluster. The results of these calculations and experimental data of the material and energy flow of particular processes will enable to choose the proper version for arrangement of the processing lines in the cluster. The global applying of zero emissions approach is also demonstrated. The benefits and the problems of realization of an integrated cluster are discussed. The oriented graph idea is used as the first attempt to optimize the clustering.</abstract>

    <title>Characterisation and application of NovaFiber lignin.</title>
    <abstract>Sulphur-free lignin coming from a novel alkaline-pulping process called NovaFiber, which has been developed by KIRAM AB, has been characterised and evaluated for potential applications. A Kraft lignin has been used for comparison. Considering the characterisation results of a NovaFiber softwood and Kraft lignin, it can be concluded that these lignins significantly differ in amounts of functional groups, molecular weight and acidity. This will affect their properties towards the potential applications studied in this project. The chemical composition and thermal stability to about 220 degrees C of both types of lignin are comparable. The "high molecular" NovaFiber lignin is totally different from the other lignins due to a high ash content, as a result of the different precipitation procedure used. This study has shown that NovaFiber lignin has a great potential as functional additive for UV stabilisation of thermoplastics and as part of a phenol formaldehyde-based wood adhesive. Initial results demonstrate that NovaFiber and Kraft lignin act as UV stabilisers in polyethylene with comparable or only slightly inferior product performance, with respect to UV exposure, compared to a relatively very expensive commercially applied stabiliser (HALS). This means that NovaFiber lignin has a very good price/performance ratio. Without loss of adhesive strength, 31% of phenol formaldehyde can be replaced by NovaFiber and Kraft lignin in a wood adhesive. The adhesive properties have been improved to a level substantially higher than the phenol formaldehyde resin by using modified lignin, after sodium dithionite treatment, and/or by using a higher curing temperature. Furthermore, the processing of NovaFiber lignin is easier compared to Kraft lignin in respect of the mixing/solubility of the lignin in the thermoplastic or glue matrix and the amount of released odour seems to be much less.</abstract>

    <title>Reactivity of sulphur-free alkali lignins within starch films.</title>
    <abstract>Three alkali lignin samples (one from sugar cane bagasse and two from wheat straw), were compared in terms of structure and reactivity when incorporated within a starch matrix submitted to electron beam irradiation. Films with a 60/40 starch to lignin ratio as well as control films made from pure starch were prepared by a casting technique in an aqueous medium. With the objective to cross-link the polymers, films were treated with radiation doses of 200 and 400 kGy. The influence of casting and irradiation on the films was investigated at a molecular level using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Infrared spectra of the native and irradiated films showed that the intensity of the structural modifications induced by the treatment was both dependent on the irradiation dose and the lignin sample. Two samples showing opposite behavior were selected for further lignin structural investigation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS determination of low-molecular-weight phenolics. These analyses provided some evidences that condensation/oligomerization reactions occurred when the more reactive system (starch/bagasse lignin) was subjected to electron beam treatment and that these reactions were probably mediated by ferulic acid. This study highlights the reactivity of alkali lignins and the potential of irradiations to increase starch/lignin compatibility.</abstract>

    <title>Volatility and price jumps in agricultural futures prices--evidence from wheat options.</title>
    <abstract>Evidence suggests that agricultural futures price movements have fat-tailed distributions and exhibit sudden and unexpected price jumps. There is also evidence that the volatility of futures prices is time-dependent both as a function of calendar-time (seasonal effect) and time to maturity (maturity effect). This article extends Bates' (1991) jump-diffusion option pricing model by including both seasonal and maturity effects in the volatility specification. Both in-sample and out-of-sample procedures to fit market option prices on wheat futures show that the suggested model outperforms previous published models. A numerical example shows the magnitude of pricing errors for option valuation.</abstract>

    <title>Price dynamics in a vertical sector: the case of butter.</title>
    <abstract>We develop a reduced-form model of price transmission in a vertical sector, allowing for refined asymmetric, contemporaneous and lagged, own and cross-price effects under time-varying volatility. The model is used to investigate the wholesale-retail price dynamics in the U.S. butter market. The analysis documents the nature of nonlinear price dynamics in a vertical sector. It finds strong evidence of asymmetric retail price responses, both in the short term and the longer term, but only weak evidence of asymmetric wholesale price responses. Asymmetric retail responses play a major role in generating a skewed distribution of butter prices. The empirical results indicate the presence of imperfect competition at the retail level.</abstract>

    <title>Using elasticities from an almost ideal demand system? watch out for group expenditure!</title>
    <abstract>Group expenditure has often been treated as exogenous when estimating demand parameters for a group of commodities with an almost ideal demand system. Researchers draw demand elasticities from past literature to use in their own analysis, but elasticities contingent on exogenous group expenditure may be inappropriate. Here, the approach is considered in the case of Japanese meat demand with a simple equation added to estimate group expenditures. The results show that elasticities should be revised and that a group expenditure equation is not a panacea as it may result in the violation of theoretical restrictions, such as symmetry.</abstract>

    <title>Flower stimulation is cost-effective in Douglas-fir seed orchards.</title>
    <abstract>The impact of flower induction on seed cost was studied considering three models of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seed orchards corresponding to different levels of management, four flower induction treatments (none, girdling, girdling + gibberellin 4/7, girdling + gibberellin 4/7 + nitrogen fertilization) and two periods of production (20 and 30 years corresponding to 32- and 42-year life spans, respectively). Seed cost referred to seeds still on the trees before cone collection. Flower stimulation considerably reduced seed production cost regardless of the intensity of orchard management and the production period. Flower induction was found to be most cost-effective in the case of intensively managed orchards and seed costs were reduced by 33 per cent when the period of production increased from 20 to 30 years. On average, girdling, girdling + gibberellin 4/7 injection and girdling + gibberellin injection + nitrogen fertilization reduced seed production costs by 2.7, 4.6 and 5.5, respectively. Therefore, the most sophisticated and intensive treatments were the most cost-effective. The study found that it is in the interest of the seed orchard manager to use flower induction treatments since they allow the production of more seeds of higher genetic quality at a cheaper rate per seed.</abstract>

    <title>Leaf-level productivity traits in Populus grown in short rotation coppice for biomass energy.</title>
    <abstract>Populus is a genus of extremely fast-growing trees originating in the northern hemisphere, with potential as a source of renewable, biomass energy. The aim of this work was to physiologically characterize genotypes of hybrid poplar, informing future selection, breeding and the development of process-based yield models. Two experiments - a short rotation coppice field trial at two contrasting UK sites and a glasshouse experiment - were conducted on five different genotypes of Populus. The field trial experiment showed that stemwood yields varied between 5.8 and 11.8 t ha-1 a-1 and that the genotype, Hoogvorst (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides) was the most productive. This production was characterized at a physiological level by rapid rates of leaf expansion and slow rates of leaf production and, at a cellular level, by the largest epidermal cell number per leaf. The glasshouse experiment confirmed the superior productivity of Hoogvorst, with this genotype producing the largest individual leaf areas (P< = 0.005) that were highly correlated with biomass production (R2 = 0.7). There was no correlation between leaf-level photosynthesis measurements and total biomass production. In general, leaf level photosynthetic characteristics were less able to differentiate between the most productive and less productive genotypes than morphological traits.</abstract>

    <title>Comparison of four glyphosate herbicide formulations for white spruce release treatment.</title>
    <abstract>An operational field trial was established to compare the efficacy and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss.) tolerance of three alternative glyphosate formulations to Vision, Canada's originally registered forestry formulation. The trial was done at operational scale (minimum treatment unit 7 ha) using helicopter application of all products. The tested alternatives included two new generic formulations, recently registered for forestry in Canada (Glyfos-Forza and Vantage), and one widely used formulation in the United States (Accord). All four formulations provided greater than 90% control of bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) Beauv.) through 23 months post-treatment (p > 0.27). Assessed over the same period, the three Canadian formulations provided equivalent white spruce tolerance (p > 0.10), with seedlings exhibiting only minor, non-lethal herbicide injury. Accord, not registered for use in Canada, consistently provided the best crop tolerance, but differences were only statistically significant 11 months post-treatment (p = 0.10). The results suggest that foresters may choose among the glyphosate formulations available in Canada without concern for product-related differences in efficacy and white spruce tolerance.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents a method for preparing wood sections and reading tree rings in diffuse-porous hardwoods that is more efficient than the standard sanding method. The planing of fresh samples and the use of an ultraviolet light source in conjunction with a fluorescent dye reduced the preparation time by 39%. No significant differences were found between the two methods for the time needed for ring count. The fluorescent method can be used for both wood sections and cores, and it can be applied to coniferous species.</abstract>

    <abstract>A national survey of broiler industry executives is conducted to analyze site-specific factors related to the broiler-complex location problem. Conjoint analysis is used to analyze the broiler complex location decision. Feed costs, community attitude toward the broiler industry, availability of geographically concentrated growers, unemployment rates, and wage rates were found to be the top five factors affecting broiler company location decisions. The quality of roads between feed mill and growers; electricity, heating, water, and sewage costs; and the number of potential growers in the region were also found to be important.</abstract>

    <title>Alfalfa hay quality and alternative pricing systems.</title>
    <abstract>Price-quality relationships for alfalfa hay were analyzed by hedonic pricing models using 1996-2001 Wisconsin auction data. Individual nutrients included in the analysis all affected alfalfa price, with acid detergent fiber accounting for the largest impact. Alternative pricing models, based on an aggregate quality index or detailed quality information, were similar in their ability to predict price. However, disaggregating price predictions to account for differences in relative feed value (RFV) and crude protein (CP) indicate that both RFV and CP are important determinants of price and that aggregating the two into a quality index is not warranted.</abstract>

    <abstract>A concern in the political economy is how national income is shared between labor and capital. This study evaluates long-term changes in factor income shares in three agri-food industries, their attribution to the level of factor usage or to factor compensation rates, and relation to changes in capital intensity and factor productivity. We find long-term stability in the profit and labor shares of farm income, decline in the profit share of agricultural services industry income, and increase in the profit share of food manufacturing income due to fewer productivity improvements being passed on to wage increases.</abstract>

    <title>Cutting production is affected by pinch number during scaffold development of stock plants.</title>
    <abstract>Stock plants of four vegetatively propagated annual species (Argyranthemum frutescens 'Comet Pink', Nemesia fruticans 'Plum Sachet' Venten., Osteospermum fruticosum 'Zulu' L., and Verbena xhybrida 'Lanai Bright Pink' L.) were grown with one (P), two (PP), or three (PPP) pinches during the scaffold development phase. The number of pinches applied to all four species affected the yield and distribution of cuttings produced over time. P began to produce cuttings first; however, the rate (number of cuttings per week) of cutting production was relatively low resulting in the fewest total cuttings produced by the end of the experiment. Cutting harvest from PPP started 3 to 6 weeks after cuttings were initially harvested from P. However, the rate of increase in cutting production was greater in PPP than P for all species, except Osteospermum, so the total cutting yield of PPP equaled P after 3 to 5 weeks of cutting production. The final cutting yield for PPP was 38%, 38%, 20%, and 8% higher than P for Argyranthemum, Nemesia, Osteospermum, and Verbena, respectively. PP produced 24%, 17%, and 21% more total cuttings than P for Argyranthemum, Nemesia, and Osteospermum, respectively, while Verbena displayed no significant difference. At the termination of the experiment, the weekly rate of cutting production increased 66.3%, 84.0%, and 30.5% as pinch number increased from P to PPP for Argyranthemum, Nemesia, and Verbena, respectively. This study demonstrates that the number of pinches performed on stock plants during scaffold development can have a significant impact on the timing, the weekly production rate, and cumulative yield of cuttings harvested.</abstract>

    <title>Application of Pseudomonas aureofaciens Tx-1 through irrigation for control of dollar spot and brown patch on fairway-height turf.</title>
    <abstract>Pseudomonas aureofaciens strain Tx-1 is suggested as a biological control for Sclerotinia homoeocarpa (F.T. Bennett) and brown patch (Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn) on golf courses. To overcome application difficulties, a field bioreactor is used to grow Tx-1 daily and then inject into nightly irrigation on the golf course. Though Tx-1 shows some promise for disease control in vitro, it is relatively untested under field conditions. We conducted three field experiments to 1) evaluate the efficacy Tx-1 when applied through an irrigation system for the control of dollar spot and brown patch; 2) determine if there is an interaction between nitrogen fertility or fungicides on efficacy of Tx-1; and 3) determine if Tx-1 can extend the duration of dollar spot control by a single application of fungicide. Nightly applications of Tx-1 through irrigation did not affect brown patch on 'Astoria' colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris Sibth.) during the 2 years of our study. Tx-1 reduced dollar spot in 'Crenshaw' creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) by 37% in 1998 compared to non-Tx-1 treatments, but Tx-1 had no effect on dollar spot in 1999. Under low disease pressure, Tx-1 increased the dollar spot control of fungicides by 32% and increased the duration of control by 2.6 days. However, Tx-1 had no effect on fungicide efficacy or duration of control later in the summer when dollar spot pressure was high. Fungicides did not negatively affect Tx-1's control of brown patch or dollar spot, nor did fertilizer regime affect brown patch or dollar spot control by Tx-1. Although delivery of Tx-1 in our studies was optimized, disease control was marginal and occurred only under low disease pressure. Therefore, we conclude Tx-1 has limited practical value for turfgrass disease control on golf courses.</abstract>

    <title>Methods for studying collective action in rural development.</title>
    <abstract>With renewed recognition of the importance of collective action in many aspects of agriculture, natural resource management, and rural development programmes in developing countries, there is a need for research on the factors that affect its emergence, as well as its performance. Yet because of its dynamic nature, collective action is difficult to measure and study. This article discusses ways of conceptualising collective action to provide researchers from various disciplines with a basic framework for understanding and studying collective action. It highlights specific features of collective action that are relevant to identify best practice methodological approaches and research techniques. The main part of the paper then describes how collective action can be operationalised, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different methods, as well as discussing complementarities among methods. This discussion provides an overview for subsequent studies in this special issue, which present applications of qualitative, quantitative, experimental, and action research methods for studying collective action.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing the factors underlying differences in achievements of farmer groups: methodological issues and empirical findings from the highlands of Central Kenya.</title>
    <abstract>This paper examines the performance of rural-based community groups in Central Kenya and addresses the methodological issues and challenges faced in doing this. Performance measures included subjective and objective ratings of success, including more objectively verifiable measures at household and group levels, derived from a survey of 87 groups and 442 households within four sites. Empirical evidence regarding explanatory factors for relative performance levels is presented using a special sample of 40 groups involved in tree nursery activities, with both descriptive analysis and regression models. Collective action is desired and practised for many tasks. The incredible number, diversity and dynamic nature of groups make it difficult to standardise and measure achievement. Choice and level of performance measures matters in explaining differences in group achievement. Focusing on groups undertaking similar activities allows deeper analysis of performance drivers. Examining different types of groups engaged tree nurseries found that performance was not linked to any easy-to-measure group characteristic, implying that for this task dissemination need not be targeted towards particular types of groups.</abstract>

    <title>Understanding, measuring and utilizing social capital: clarifying concepts and presenting a field application from India.</title>
    <abstract>Social capital has been defined as a resource, a propensity for mutually beneficial collective action, that communities possess to different extents. Communities with high levels of social capital are able to act together collectively for achieving diverse common objectives. While the concept of social capital is valid universally, the measure of social capital will vary by context. It must be related in each case to aspects of social relations that assist mutually beneficial collective action within that particular cultural context. A locally-relevant scale of social capital was developed to assess whether and how social capital mattered for development performance in 69 north Indian villages. Variables corresponding to other bodies of explanation, including extent of commercialisation, relative stratification, and relative need were also examined, but a combination of high social capital and capable agency was found to associate most closely with high development performance. Agency is important particularly in situations where institutions are not available that enable citizens to connect with the state and with markets. The productivity of social capital is considerably reduced on account of this institutional gap. Development performance can be improved in these situations by adding to the stock of social capital and also through enhancing agency capacity.</abstract>

    <title>Collective action for grazing land management in crop-livestock mixed systems in the highlands of northern Ethiopia.</title>
    <abstract>Communal grazing lands are important sources of livestock feed in developing countries. The uncontrolled and free grazing system in many of these countries has caused severe degradation of these resources. This paper examines the nature and determinants of collective action for grazing land management in the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. We find that community grazing land management contributes to more sustainable use of the resource and alleviation of feed shortage. Most collective action is locally initiated and is organized at village level. Collective action for grazing land management may be more beneficial and more effective in areas with intermediate population, higher social capital, and lower heterogeneity in oxen ownership that are far from market places.</abstract>

    <title>What do people bring into the game? Experiments in the field about cooperation in the commons.</title>
    <abstract>Experimental research has enhanced the knowledge acquired from theoretical and field sources of when and how groups can solve the problem of collective action through self-governing mechanisms. Widespread agreement exists that cooperation can happen, but little agreement as to how. As a first step, we propose that individuals may use three layers of information in deciding about their level of cooperation. The layers range from the material incentives of a specific production function and the dynamics of the game, to the composition of the group and the individual characteristics of the player. We use this framework to analyze data from a set of experiments conducted with actual ecosystem users in three rural villages of Colombia. Prior experience of the participants, their perception of external regulation, and the composition of the group, influence decisions to cooperate or defect in the experiment. Understanding the multiple information levels of a game as they affect incentives helps to explain decisions in collective-action dilemmas.</abstract>

    <title>Diagnosing phosphorus status of natural grassland in the presence of white clover.</title>
    <abstract>The phosphorus nutrition index (PNI) method proved to be suitable for diagnosing P nutrition level over a wide range of grass swards. It is based on relative nutrient concentrations and relies on a critical curve for optimum P concentration which is a function of sward N concentration. The objectives of this paper were to verify to what extent this method was valid for P nutrition diagnosis when white clover was present in the sward in view of the fact that white clover N concentration is frequently reported to be much higher than that of grass and to remain constant whatever the amount of biomass produced. For this purpose we analysed the effect of N addition on N and P concentrations in white clover and rye grass grown in pure stands with unlimited P supply in a garden collection and compared it with clover behaviour in a field experiment on a natural grassland with a similar P status. Clover displayed a different affinity for P according to whether it grew in a pure or mixed sward. In a pure stand, we observed a very significant effect of N on N and P concentrations measured in individual organs and whole plants; the highest N concentrations were measured in clover. This species behaved differently from ryegrass: for a given level of N supply, plant N concentration decreased when petioles were added to the laminae samples, while P concentrations remained constant; for rye grass both N and P concentrations decreased when sheaths were added to laminae. Clover in mixed swards had a lower P nutritional status than when grown in a pure stand, due to its lower capacity to compete with grasses for light capture and P acquisition. Analysis of data from the literature demonstrated that differences in response between clover and grass were more pronounced under limited P supply, when clover displayed a lower ability than grasses to adjust P concentration to that of N due to its lower capacity to adapt to low P availability. As a consequence it became even less competitive. We concluded that there are limitations to the use of nutrient diagnosis systems based on relative concentrations when the herbage contains a large proportion of white clover and proposed that only the non-clover fraction should be used for diagnosis to avoid excessive P application when PNIs are used for fertiliser recommendations.</abstract>

    <title>Determination and evaluation of genetic coefficients of peanut lines for breeding applications.</title>
    <abstract>Application of a crop simulation model as a plant breeding tool requires cultivar-specific coefficients for a large number of breeding lines which are commonly not available. These cultivar coefficients are normally estimated from field experiments conducted under optimum conditions over several environments, that include a combination of multiple planting dates or locations. However, it is difficult to adhere to this recommendation when many genotypes are involved, such as in plant breeding applications. The objective of this study was to derive genetic coefficients of two groups of advanced peanut breeding lines based on experimental data collected during two growing seasons. The two groups investigated included 12 lines of the large-seeded Virginia type and 14 lines of the small-seeded Spanish type which were under multi-location evaluation at the regional yield trial stage in Thailand in 1998-1999. These lines were grown during the early-rainy season of 1999 and the dry season of 2000 at Khon Kaen University (KKU) in Northeast Thailand. Data were collected on plant development and growth characteristics, soil characteristics, weather and management as required for determining genetic coefficients of a new peanut cultivar. The data were then used for model calibration, using a stepwise procedure to derive the 15 genetic coefficients of the individual lines and cultivars required for the CROPGRO-Peanut model. The results showed that the derived genetic coefficients provided simulated values of various development and growth parameters that were in good agreement with their corresponding observed values for almost all parameters. Model evaluation with an independent data set of four peanut lines grown during the rainy and dry seasons of 2001 and 2002 gave similar results. The differences among breeding lines were also expressed through differences in the derived genetic coefficients. These results suggest that the genetic coefficients of peanut lines obtained from detailed experimental data for two distinct seasons are sufficiently accurate for further evaluation of the CROPGRO-Peanut model in breeding applications.</abstract>

    <title>Impact of salinity on the fruit yield of mango (Mangifera indica L. cv. 'Osteen' ).</title>
    <abstract>The impact of saline irrigation water of different chloride and sodium concentrations on the fruit yield of field-grown mango (Mangifera indica L. cv. 'Osteen') was evaluated for 4 years (1996-1999). Tree performance was evaluated for two rootstocks (Gomera-1 or Gomera-3) and at water salinities having an electrical conductivity of 1.02, 1.50, 2.00 or 2.50 dS m-1. The results demonstrated that Gomera-1 was slightly more tolerant to salinity than Gomera-3. The sensitivity of Gomera-3 was reflected in smaller fruit and lower yield in the most saline treatments. In addition, chloride and sodium concentrations in leaves and fruits were higher in the trees with Gomera-3. The results from analysing the salt-tolerance model of Maas and Hoffman, show that the a salinity coefficient (threshold) for the first 2 years (1996-1997) was 0.88 dS m-1, and for the following (1998-1999) was 1.81 dS m-1, respectively, while the b salinity coefficient (slope) was 17.1% per dS m-1 (1996-1997), and 12.5% per dS m-1 (1998-1999), considering that the two rootstocks are not different in terms of the model. These parameters are characteristic of moderately sensitive crops.</abstract>

    <abstract>Colored plastic mulches were evaluated for their effect on the production of a triploid ('Honeyheart') and a diploid ('Sangria') watermelon cultivar during the spring growing season. Colored mulches affected cucumber beetle populations; the SRM-Red (Selective Reflective Mulch) and yellow plastic mulch plots had among the highest cucumber beetle populations recorded in both cultivars while the silver-reflective and the silver-on-black plastic mulches had among the lowest. In general, most mulched plots had longer vines than the bare-ground treatment, with few differences in vine length among treatments by 4 weeks. There were no differences among mulch treatments in first and total 'Honeyheart' harvest while the IRT-100 (infrared transmitting; green), PST (photosynthetic reduced transmitting), and silver-on-black plastic mulches had the highest first 'Sangria' harvest and among the highest total 'Sangria' harvest. Plants in plastic mulch treatments had higher yields as a result of higher fruit number per area. Fruit weight, length, and diameter and total soluble solids for both cultivars were not affected by colored plastic mulch treatments.</abstract>

    <abstract>To determine the effect of blossom and fruitlet thinners on crop load, fruit weight, seed development during the year of treatment, and the subsequent year effect on return bloom, fruit weight and yield, a field trial using the biennial apple cultivar 'Northern Spy' (Malus x domestica Borkh.) was established. Treatments applied at full bloom included ATS (ammonium thiosulphate) [12% (w/v) nitrogen, 26% (w/v) S]; TD [15.9% (w/v) diacarboxylic acid, 5.5% (w/v) dimethylalkylamine salt (Endothal)] and SCY [57% (w/v) pelargonic acid (Scythe)]. At 18 days after full bloom (DAFB), oil treatments [98% (w/v) mineral oil (Superior "70" oil)] were applied with S [480 g.L(-1) a.i. carbaryl (Sevin XLR)] and without as a means of increasing the efficacy of S. BA [19 g.L(-1) a.i. 6-benzyladenine/1.9 g.L(-1) a.i. gibberellins 4+7 (Accel)]; S; and/or SA [100% (w/w) 2-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid)], were also applied in a factorial arrangement on the same day. Fruit abscission was significantly increased the year of treatment with BA, S, BA + S, BA + SA, S + SA, BA + S + SA, oil, and S + oil. Average fruit weight was enhanced by S, BA + S, BA + SA, S + SA, BA + S + SA, and S + oil although in the latter treatment the crop load was very low. Only treatments that included BA reduced the number of fully developed seeds per fruit and seed number per trunk cross-sectional area (TCA) and increased return bloom. Defining the number of fully developed seeds per tree coupled with crop load is proposed as a predictor of return bloom in 'Northern Spy'.</abstract>

    <title>1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) for maintaining texture quality of fresh-cut tomato.</title>
    <abstract>A study was conducted to determine the effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on textural changes in fresh-cut tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, Mill.) slices during storage at 5 degrees C. The relationship between fruit developmental stage and tissue watersoaking development was also determined. Fresh-cut tomato slices prepared from light-red fruit that had been exposed to 1-MCP (1 microliter.L(-1) for 24 h at 5 degrees C) retained significantly higher pericarp firmness during storage at 5 degrees C for 10 d than slices from nontreated fruit or slices stored at 10 or 15 degrees C and they also had a significantly higher ethylene production maximum. 1-MCP (1 or 10 microliter.L(-1) for 24 h at 5 degrees C) had no affect on the firmness of fresh-cut, red tomato slices at 5 degrees C or on slices prepared from 5 degrees C-stored, intact red tomatoes. Nor did 1-MCP treatment have a significant effect on electrolyte leakage of tomato slices or intact fruit stored at 5 degrees C. Slices from fruit of the same developmental stage but with higher initial firmness values had less watersoaking development and responded better to 1-MCP treatment during 8 d storage at 5 degrees C. 1-MCP (1 microliter.L(-1)) was more effective in reducing watersoaking in light red stage tomato slices when applied at 5 degrees C for 24 h compared with 1-MCP applied at 10 or 15 degrees C. Watersoaking development was also more rapid in fresh-cut tomato slices as initial fruit ripeness advanced from breaker to red stage. Our results suggest that watersoaking development in fresh-cut tomato slices is an ethylene-mediated symptom of senescence and not a symptom of chilling injury as had previously been proposed.</abstract>

    <title>Commercial application of a photoautotrophic micropropagation system using large vessels with forced ventilation: plantlet growth and production cost.</title>
    <abstract>A photoautotrophic or sugar-free medium micropropagation system (PAM) using five large culture vessels (volume = 120 L each) with a forced ventilation unit for supplying CO2-enriched air was developed and applied to commercial production of calla lily (Zantedeschia elliottiana) and china fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantlets. The culture period of calla lily plantlets in the PAM was reduced by 50%, compared with that in a conventional, photomixotrophic micropropagation system (PMM) using small vessels each containing a sugar-containing medium. Percent survival ex vitro of calla lily plantlets from the PAM was 95%, while that from the PMM was 60%. The production cost of calla lily in the PAM was reduced by about 40%, compared with that in the PMM, and the initial investment per plantlet for the PAM was approximately equal to 10% lower than that for the PMM. The sales price of ex vitro acclimatized calla lily plantlet was increased by 25% due to its higher quality, compared with plantlets produced in the PMM.</abstract>

    <title>Local entrepreneurship: A development model based on community interaction field theory.</title>
    <abstract>Local entrepreneurship shows great potential as an economic development strategy for rural communities with stagnating or declining economies. However, nascent entrepreneurs often lack knowledge of ways to actualize their ideas, and communities often lack the social infrastructure to help entrepreneurs achieve success. Educational programs supporting entrepreneurship can play a vital role in rural community economic development. The Nebraska Enhancing, Developing and Growing Entrepreneurs (EDGE) educational program is community based, with organizing principles derived primarily from community interaction field theory. More than 1,600 nascent and active entrepreneurs have participated in EDGE since 1993. The authors draw on community interaction field theory and eight community case studies to explore an action model for delivery of an educational program of locality-based entrepreneurship. The EDGE model has implications for the delivery of long-range community development programs.</abstract>

    <title>Promoting the 'civic' in entrepreneurship: The case of rural Slovakia.</title>
    <abstract>The literature on entrepreneurship emphasizes the importance of the characteristics of individual entrepreneurs, their social networks, and the broader economic, cultural and political institutional landscape. In Slovakia and many of the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe, attention to social and cultural concerns and the institutional framework to support economic development was given insufficient attention at the beginning of the transition to capitalism. This paper shows the importance of social and cultural norms and experiential learning in providing the foundation for entrepreneurship and economic development. It presents a successful rural development model from Slovakia, which used mini-grants to build individual and community capacity for civic entrepreneurship as a precursor to economic entrepreneurship.</abstract>

    <title>Dynamic relationships among U.S. wheat-related markets: applying directed acyclic graphs to a time series model.</title>
    <abstract>Using advanced methods of directed acyclic graphs with Bernanke structural vector autoregression models, this article extends recent econometric research on quarterly U.S. markets for wheat and wheat-based value-added products downstream. Analyses of impulse response simulations and forecast error variance decompositions provide updated estimates of market elasticity parameters that drive these markets, and updated policy-relevant information on how these quarterly markets run and dynamically interact. Results suggest that movements in wheat and downstream wheat-based markets strongly influence each other, although most of these effects occur at the longer-run horizons beyond a single crop cycle.</abstract>

    <title>Adoption of site-specific information and variable-rate technologies in cotton precision farming.</title>
    <abstract>Probit analysis identified factors that influence the adoption of precision farming technologies by Southeastern cotton farmers. Younger, more educated farmers who operated larger farms and were optimistic about the future of precision farming were most likely to adopt site-specific information technology. The probability of adopting variable-rate input application technology was higher for younger farmers who operated larger farms, owned more of the land they farmed, were more informed about the costs and benefits of precision farming, and were optimistic about the future of precision farming. Computer use was not important, possibly because custom hiring shifts the burden of computer use to agribusiness firms.</abstract>

    <title>Buyback programs: goals, objectives, and industry restructuring in fisheries.</title>
    <abstract>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries has conducted several buyback programs to reduce harvesting capacity in fisheries. These programs have attempted to maximize capacity reduction given a fixed budget. However, restructuring issues have not been considered. We explore the possibility of satisfying three different buyback objectives. We examine the black sea bass trap fishery and determine the number of vessels given different allowable catch levels and objectives of maximizing technical efficiency, capacity utilization, and vessels in the fishery. We find considerable variation in the number of vessels allowed to remain in the fishery given the different objectives.</abstract>

    <title>Developing policy relevant agrifood models.</title>
    <abstract>The opportunities and challenges of incorporating accurate policy representations into institutional partial equilibrium commodity models were investigated. Six issues are raised: commodity space definition, vertical linkages, assessing market power, the changing nature of government support, trade policy, and data requirements. The importance of product attributes and different approaches to modeling product differentiation are considered. A case study of food safety is used to bring together the major issues. Although institutional commodity models still have a role to play, we advocate the use of smaller idiosyncratic models to address many of the relevant policy questions in a rapidly changing sector.</abstract>

    <abstract>Major issues and challenges encountered in modeling and analyzing agricultural and trade policy reforms are reviewed. We focus on modeling approach and pay special attention to the type and scope of models, calibration of a realistic baseline scenario, representation of the reform agreement, use of extramodel information, choice of metrics to measure reform impacts, and emerging issues in policy modeling. Existing solutions and unresolved issues are examined. We stress the complementarity of various modeling approaches in assessing policy reforms and the importance of helping users understand the limitations of the chosen approach.</abstract>

    <title>Economic comparison of commodity and conservation program benefits: an example from the Mississippi Delta.</title>
    <abstract>Changes to commodity programs in the 2002 Farm Bill increased the value of crop base acreages on which decoupled payments are received. The bill also expanded the availability of key conservation programs. This paper compares the value of payments from commodity programs (along with continued crop production) to the easement payment (and recreational lease revenue) available under the Wetland Reserve Program. A net present value model using risk-adjusted returns is employed in the analysis for Mississippi delta cropland containing rice, cotton, and soybean base. Sensitivity analysis is conducted on some of the key variables affecting the decision.</abstract>

    <title>Productivity and land enhancing technologies in northern Ethiopia: health, public investments, and sequential adoption.</title>
    <abstract>The adoption of more efficient farming practices and technologies that enhance agricultural productivity and improve environmental sustainability is instrumental for achieving economic growth, food security, and poverty alleviation in sub-Saharan Africa. Our research examines the interaction between public investments, community health, and adoption of productivity and land enhancing technologies by households in the northern Ethiopian state of Tigray. Agricultural technology adoption decisions are modeled as a sequential process where the timing of choices can matter. We find that time spent sick and opportunity costs of caring for sick family members are significant factors in adoption. Sickness, through its impact on household income and labor allocation decisions for healthcare and other activities, significantly reduces the likelihood of technology adoption. Our findings suggest that agencies working to improve agricultural productivity and land resource conservation should consider not only the financial status of potential adopters, but also their related health situation.</abstract>

    <abstract>A conceptual model is developed to evaluate the effect of Bt corn on risk. Results highlight the importance of distinguishing between marginal and aggregate risk effects and demonstrate that the effect of Bt corn on risk depends crucially on the price paid for the technology. Empirical results show that, depending on the price, Bt corn can be marginally risk increasing or decreasing and can either increase or decrease corn acreage. Also, depending on the price, Bt corn can provide a risk benefit to farmers, even when Bt corn is risk increasing.</abstract>

    <title>Two-step econometric estimation of farm characteristics affecting marketing contract decisions.</title>
    <abstract>We examine how farm characteristics affect marketing contract decisions. We relax the restrictive assumptions of Tobit, Poisson, and multinomial logit models and consider the quantity, frequency, and contract type decisions conditional on, rather than jointly with, the contract adoption decision. In contrast to earlier studies on marketing contract decisions, we estimate a two-step econometric model using Agricultural Resource Management Study data and find that farm characteristics affecting decisions to adopt marketing contracts differ from those affecting decisions regarding quantity, frequency, and contract type.</abstract>

    <title>Hog producer preferences for marketing contract attributes.</title>
    <abstract>We use a stated preference instrument to elicit producer preferences for the attributes of risk-shifting hog marketing contracts and express acceptable producer trade-offs between contract attributes in a convenient dollar metric. Respondents value an increase in a window contract's price ceiling three to five times more than the same increase in the price floor, which suggests that hog producers dislike contracts that limit up-side price potential (limit positive skewness). The contractor's organizational form is also important. Cooperative forms are preferred by many respondents, particularly those who state that trust in the contractor is an important antecedent for any contractual relationship.</abstract>

    <title>Seasonal adjustment in a market for female agricultural workers.</title>
    <abstract>This article explores seasonal adjustment in the market for temporary agricultural labor. We estimate a model of participation allowing for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity/selection bias using daily observations from Chilean panel data, and a model of daily earnings. Results indicate that seasonal wage variation is an important aspect of labor-market adjustment, contributing to a large change in labor force participation. The labor force participation rate of women is significantly more elastic to changes in the expected wage than is that for men. Nonetheless, we find evidence of substantial open unemployment during the slack season, especially for females, probably due to frictional and efficiency wage effects.</abstract>

    <title>Entrepreneurial behaviour of Dutch dairy farmers under a milk quota system: goals, objectives and attitudes.</title>
    <abstract>An empirical model, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, was developed to test the hypothesis that differences in farmers' goals, objectives and attitudes are a determinant of strategic and entrepreneurial behaviour and will, therefore, result in differences in farm size. The theory states that a person's behaviour results from his/her goals and intentions, attitudes, perceived behavioural control and social norms. Data (n=257) were gathered from a questionnaire that was sent to a selected group of Dutch dairy farmers, members of study-groups in the northern part of the Netherlands. Answers to statements about goals as well as statements related to attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control, explained 38% of the variance in farm size as expressed by farmers' milk quota. The goal of having a "large and modern farm" was positively correlated with farm size, while those related to "having a breeding farm" and "extra source of income" were significantly negatively correlated with farm size. A significant relationship was found between behaviour (farm size as expressed by a farm's milk quota) and goals and intentions of farmers. This relationship is even stronger when statements on attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioural control are included. Farm size is mainly explained by farmers' instrumental goals. This suggests that farm size is not relevant for fulfilling intrinsic, expressive and social goals. This research shows a consistency with the Theory of Planned Behaviour and can be used in empirical research by applying it to data collected in a questionnaire. Such psychological models on decision making can help to yield insight into aspects related to entrepreneurial behaviour of dairy farmers.</abstract>

    <title>Optimisation of field machinery for an arable farm converting to organic farming.</title>
    <abstract>Optimal crop and machinery systems are essential if organic farming is to be economically competitive. The aim of this study was to examine how the capacity of an optimal field machinery system is affected with respect to economy when a farm converts to organic production. An important part of the work was to calculate timeliness factors valid for organic farming. A case study was made for a typical arable farm in the south-central part of Sweden. To keep the scope manageable, the focus was on two of the most important machines used; the seed drill and the combine harvester. Machinery costs consist of three parts: direct machine costs, labour costs and timeliness costs. For optimisation of farm machinery systems, a method based on linear programming was used. The optimal size of the seed drill and combine harvester increased when the arable farm in this study converted to organic production. The total machine costs were 7% higher in conventional production but calculated per kg grain produced the machine costs were 58% higher in organic production. The main differences in timeliness costs between organic and conventional farming can be attributed to two counteracting facts: the lower yields and the higher product prices in organic farming. Timeliness cost per kg cereal produced was higher in organic production.</abstract>

    <title>A critical assessment of the system of rice intensification (SRI).</title>
    <abstract>The system of rice intensification (SRI) has been proposed as an integrated and agroecologically sound approach to rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation. It was mainly developed through participatory on-farm research conducted in Madagascar, but its evaluation is ongoing in Asia as well. This paper critically discusses some of the assumptions underlying the SRI and its scope for improving rice production in Asia. A review of cropping practices at known high-yield sites showed that techniques such as SRI are not necessary for growing rice near the yield potential. A move from permanent flooding to intermittent irrigation bears short- and long-term risks that are not well understood, but non-flooded conditions will generally favor rice growth on poor soils with potential for Fe toxicity. Deep root systems are associated with low input rice cropping and the intermittent water management practiced in SRI, but they are not a necessity for maximum rice performance, particularly in favorable environments with intensive cropping, short growth duration, and good water and nitrogen management. Approaches such as SRI may serve the important needs of resource-poor farmers in areas with poor soils, but are likely to have little potential for improving rice production in intensive irrigated systems on more favorable soils, where high yields can be achieved through implementation of more cost-efficient management practices.</abstract>

    <title>Productivity growth, catching-up and uncertainty in China's meat trade.</title>
    <abstract>The potential role of China as a major importer of agricultural products, and the likely impact on world markets has been a topic of considerable debate over the past decade. In this paper, we focus specifically on the livestock sector and develop a detailed analysis of productivity growth in China's pig and poultry production along with projections of China's likely meat trade in the year 2010. We use a general equilibrium model which permits us to explore the sensitivity of our projections to macro-economic uncertainty as well as uncertainty in livestock productivity growth rates. Our analysis shows that China's net trade position is very sensitive to both of these factors. With high livestock productivity growth and a slow-down in the rest of the economy, China could be a substantial competitor in export markets by 2010. On the other hand, slow productivity growth in livestock production, coupled with a rapidly growing macro-economy could transform China into a major market for future meat exports.</abstract>

    <title>Agriculture, pesticides and the ecosystem.</title>
    <abstract>Economists have a good understanding of intra-economic interdependence and a mature methodology of modelling it. Ecologists focus on the complex and sensitive interactions of species in ecosystems. This paper's objective is to suggest a new micro-foundation of ecosystem analysis based on economic methodology, to integrate the analyses of the ecosystem and the economy and focus on the interface of ecosystem-economy relations. Agriculture forms a major part of this interface. The basic assumption is that in the short run the individual organisms of all species behave as if they optimise their costly offensive and defensive activities given other organisms' activities (Nash-behaviour). We consider an ecosystem with three species in a unidirectional food chain: buzzards feed on mice, mice feed on grain, and grain feeds on solar energy. A fourth species, humans, also feeds on grain. Humans intervene in the ecosystem in various ways. They can grow grain by using seed, farm labour, pesticides and possibly nature conservation measures to maintain buzzard habitat. Short-run ecosystem equilibrium is characterised, and it is shown, in particular, how this equilibrium depends on farming activities. We then link this ecosystem model to a simple model of an agricultural economy. Both systems are solved for equilibrium simultaneously. From an economic perspective the ecosystem induces positive and negative externalities in agricultural production and in consumer 'green' preferences. The inefficiencies of the competitive economy are identified and some possibilities to restore efficiency through corrective taxes or subsidies are briefly discussed. We also outline how short-run equilibria are connected through ecosystem stock-flow relationships. Due to the complexity of the inter-temporal analysis, the resulting ecosystem dynamics cannot be characterised in general analytical terms. It is a topic for future research to study the dynamics in numerical analysis to understand under which conditions the joint ecological and economic system is driven toward a (sustainable) steady state.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper explores the relationship between agricultural productivity and rural-urban migration by developing an econometric model and applying it to the case of Senegal. Country level data is used covering the years 1961-1996. Policy implications of reducing rural-urban migration using agricultural output elasticities are developed. The findings support the hypothesis that rural¡urban migration is a positive function of the ratio of urban per capita income to rural per capita income. Moreover, the results support a policy aimed at reducing rural-urban migration flows through increases in per capita earnings derived from increased agricultural investment.</abstract>

    <title>Irrigation water pricing: differential impacts on irrigated farms.</title>
    <abstract>European water policy, as set out in the Water Framework Directive (WFD), requires all EU Member States to implement volumetric water pricing at rates that roughly cover the total costs of providing water services. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology that, for the different types of farm in an irrigable area, will enable us to analyse the differential impact that a pricing policy for irrigation water would have. For this purpose, Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) mathematical programming models were used. The methodology is implemented on a representative area in the Duero Valley in Spain. Our results show the usefulness of differential analysis in evaluating the impact of a water pricing policy. This allows significant differences in the evolution of agricultural incomes to be observed, as well as the recovery of costs by the State, demand for agricultural employment and the consumption of agrochemicals resulting from rising prices of irrigation water in various groups of farmers within a given irrigated area.</abstract>

    <title>A cross-section analysis of household demand for food and nutrients in Tanzania.</title>
    <abstract>Undernutrition and malnutrition are still problems of unacceptable proportions in many developing countries. However, the debate on the roles of income and other socio-economic variables such as women's education and household size on food and nutrient demand continues. This study examines the demand for food and nutrients amongst households in Tanzania, using recent survey data. A quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS) is employed to estimate price and expenditure elasticities, as well as the impact of socio-economic variables on food demand patterns. A moment-based instrumental variable approach is then used to analyse the determinants of nutrient demand. The results show that income and other socio-economic variables exert significant effects on the demand for food and nutrients. The estimated expenditure elasticities for the nutrients range from 0.307 for iron to 1.26 for Vitamin B12. The elasticities are higher for those micronutrients that are consumed through animal products and lower for those micronutrients that are mainly obtained through staple foods. These results reflect the higher expenditure elasticities for meat, fish, eggs, milk, and milk products, as well as fruits and vegetables, relative to cereals and pulses, reinforcing the assertion that the demand for Vitamins A and B12, as well as calcium and zinc will increase with rising income.</abstract>

    <title>A revised Tobit procedure for mitigating bias in the presence of non-zero censoring with an application to milk-market participation in the Ethiopian highlands.</title>
    <abstract>Fixed transactions costs that prohibit exchange engender bias in supply analysis due to censoring of the sample observations. The associated bias in conventional regression procedures applied to censored data and the construction of robust methods for mitigating bias have been preoccupations of applied economists since Tobin [Econometrica 26 (1958) 24]. This literature assumes that the true point of censoring in the data is zero and, when this is not the case, imparts a bias to parameter estimates of the censored regression model. We conjecture that this bias can be significant; affirm this from experiments; and suggest techniques for mitigating this bias using Bayesian procedures. The bias-mitigating procedures are based on modifications of the key step that facilitates Bayesian estimation of the censored regression model; are easy to implement; work well in both small and large samples; and lead to significantly improved inference in the censored regression model. These findings are important in light of the widespread use of the zero-censored Tobit regression and we investigate their consequences using data on milk-market participation in the Ethiopian highlands.</abstract>

    <abstract>We analyzed the prospects and challenges for silvopasture adoption in south-central Florida using the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats approach in combination with analytic hierarchy process. We used preference data from opinion leaders who have had extensive knowledge about silvopasture practices in south-central Florida. Results reveal that strengths and opportunities for silvopasture adoption outweigh its weaknesses and threats. The participants perceive that land stewardship and diversification of income as major strengths of silvopasture and environmental benefits and government support for silvopasture practices as important opportunities. While long-term investment requirement and poor-quality soils are identified as weaknesses for the adoption of silvopasture, government regulation relating to land-use practices is considered as a critical threat. These results provide important insights for policy developments relating to silvopasture practices.</abstract>

    <title>Investigating technical efficiency and potential technological change in Dutch pig farming.</title>
    <abstract>This paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to investigate the possibilities for improving the technical, economic and environmental performance of Dutch pig farms relative to currently applied technologies and relative to currently available but not yet applied technologies. First, the efficiency is computed relating observed pig farms to the current best practice frontier. This frontier is computed from a sample of observed pig farms, using DEA based on linear programming. Second, potential technological change is computed as the change of the frontier due to addition of virtual farms (based on technologies that are available but not applied in practice yet) to the dataset. It is found that the mean technical efficiency of farms is rather high relative to the currently available technologies. Overall technical performance increases slightly when new technologies are introduced. Environmental performance increases importantly when applying new technologies. In particular, the ammonia emissions can be reduced largely by utilising the up-to-date housing techniques.</abstract>

    <title>Starch digestion site: influence of ruminal and abomasal starch infusion on starch digestion and utilization in dairy cows.</title>
    <abstract>The effect of site of starch digestion on glucose metabolism in dairy cows was studied. Four multiparous Israeli-Holstein cows in mid lactation were used in a 4 x 4 Latin-square design. Average body weight of cows was 580+/-38 kg, and average milk yield was 28+/-3 kg/day. The cows were fitted with ruminal cannula and flexible T-cannulae in abomasum and ileum. Treatments were as follows : CON (control) : water was infused to the rumen. SR (starch-rumen) : 1.5 kg/day of maize starch solution was infused into the rumen. SA (starch-abomasum) : 1.5 kg/day of maize starch solution was infused into the abomasum. SCA (starch-casein-abomasum) : 500 g/day sodium caseinate and 1.5 kg/day of maize starch solution was infused into the abomasum. Total intake of dry matter (DM), was similar in all treatments and averaged 19.9 kg/day. Total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) intake averaged in 6.8 kg/day. The average TNC digested in the rumen was 4.95 kg/day for CON and SR cows and 3.34 kg/day for the SA and the SCA cows. The average TNC digestion in the small intestine was 1.18 kg/day for CON and SR cows and 2.41 kg/day for the SA and SCA cows. TNC digestibility in the small intestine was highest for the SCA cows at 0.83 as compared with other treatments. Concentrations of plasma glucose and insulin were similar between treatments. No difference between treatments in total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration in ruminal fluids was observed. However, propionate proportion in total VFA was higher in the SR cows than in other treatments (P<0.04). Milk yield and composition were not affected by treatments in the present study. It was concluded that the amount of dietary protein in the small intestine has a considerable effect on TNC digestibility. Under conditions of high milk production and high rumen-by-pass TNC flow, efficiency of TNC utilization might be greater since TNC is digested in the small intestine rather than in the rumen.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing the use of chopper herbicide for establishing hardwood plantations on a cutover site.</title>
    <abstract>Successful establishment of hardwood plantations requires effective weed management. Mechanical weed control is inefficient, and few herbicides are available for use in hardwood plantations. In an effort to identify new chemical control options, the potential of imazapyr (Chopper herbicide) for site preparation prior to planting three common southern hardwood species was assessed. Twelve site preparation treatments were tested using Chopper applied at four rates and three timings prior to planting. Each site preparation rate and time pairing was repeated under two postplant herbicide regimesdirected glyphosate (Accord herbicide) sprays designed to maintain weed-free conditions and a single broadcast sulfometuron methyl (Oust herbicide) treatment designed to test a potential operational sequencing of Chopper site preparation followed by herbaceous weed control. Although results must be evaluated in the context of a single site and set of environmental conditions, they demonstrate the utility of Chopper herbicide for site preparation prior to planting hardwoods. For sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.), site preparation before the end of July with Chopper rates up to 64 oz/ac improved survival and growth over postplant treatments alone. For later season applications, sycamore and sweetgum were more sensitive to the Chopper site preparation rate. For Oct. site preparation, Chopper rates above 16 oz/ac adversely affected planted sycamore seedlings and rates greater than 32 oz/ac adversely effected planted sweetgum seedlings. Cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) performed best using the highest Chopper rate of 64 oz/ac regardless of timing.</abstract>

    <title>Hematological, Metabolic, and Endocrine Effects of Feeding Vitamin A and Lactoferrin in Neonatal Calves.</title>
    <abstract>There are reports of important interactions among vitamin A, lactoferrin (Lf), and components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. Newborn calves are deficient in vitamin A and have a low Lf status. Colostrum contains vitamin A, Lf, and members of the IGF system, including IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), and these compounds may exert mutual interactions in neonatal calves. Effects of feeding different amounts of vitamin A and Lf on hematological, metabolic, and endocrine traits during the first 5 d of life were studied in neonatal calves. Calves were fed a milk-based formula without (F) or with added vitamin A [F[subscript A]; 351, 402, 490, and 490 [micro]mol/kg dry matter (DM) on d 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively], Lf (F[subscript L]; 3850, 1990, 660, and 660 mg/kg DM on d 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), or vitamin A + Lf (F[subscript AL]) and colostrum (C). Blood samples were taken preprandially on d 1 to 5 and postprandially on d 1, 2, and 4 for the study of hematological, metabolic, and endocrine traits. As intestinal absorption of Lf in formula-fed calves was obviously lower than in colostrum-fed calves, Lf supplementation did not influence the metabolic and endocrine status. Plasma vitamin A concentrations increased from d 1 to 5 in F[subscript A], F[subscript AL], and C, but remained low in F and F[subscript L]. Addition of vitamin A to F affected concentrations of vitamin A from d 2 to 5; hemoglobin and triglycerides on d 3; and tended to influence IGFBP-3 levels on d 5. On d 1, preprandial insulin concentrations in F and F[subscript L] were higher than those in F[subscript A] and F[subscript AL] and growth hormone concentrations on d 3 in F[subscript A] were higher than in F[subscript AL]. In C, plasma Lf concentrations increased on d 1 and then decreased until d 5, whereas plasma urea and IGF-I concentrations remained stable. Compared with F-fed calves, C-fed calves had higher plasma concentrations of Lf from d 1 to 4, higher concentrations of vitamin A on d 5, higher concentrations of total protein from d 2 to 5, higher concentrations of triglycerides on d 3 and 4, and higher concentrations of IGF-I on d 4 and 5, but lower urea concentrations on d 4 and 5 and lower basal growth hormone concentrations than in F, F[subscript L], and F[subscript A]. In conclusion, metabolite and hormone concentrations were influenced by differences in feeding. Addition of vitamin A influenced concentrations of vitamin A, hemoglobin, and triglycerides and tended to affect IGFBP-3 levels. Lactoferrin and vitamin A did not interact with respect to the IGF-I and IGFBP-3 status.</abstract>

    <title>Dietary Supplements of Two Doses of Calcium Salts of Conjugated Linoleic Acid During the Transition Period and Early Lactation.</title>
    <abstract>Reduction of milk fat secretion by the use of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplements may alleviate energy demands during early lactation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate lactational performance, net energy balance, and reproductive response of dairy cows supplemented with 2 doses of CLA from 2 wk before predicted calving until 9 wk postpartum. Holstein cows (n = 48) were divided into 3 treatment groups: 1) control, 2) low dose CLA treatment (CLA-1), and 3) high dose CLA treatment (CLA-2). Supplements for all treatments provided 230 g/d of fat; the control group received Ca salts of palm fatty acid distillate and the CLA groups received a mixture of Ca salts of CLA isomers and Ca salts of palm fatty acid distillate (31.6 and 63.2 g/d of CLA isomers for CLA-1 and CLA-2, respectively). Supplementation with CLA resulted in an 11 and 21% decrease in milk fat yield for CLA-1 and CLA-2, respectively. Milk production and secretion of other milk components did not differ among treatments. Milk energy output was significantly reduced with CLA-2, but net energy balance, body weight, and body condition scores were unaffected. Treatment had no effect on hepatic triglyceride concentration or plasma glucose and insulin, but nonesterified fatty acids tended to be lower for CLA-1. There were no consistent dose-related effects on reproduction variables, and no adverse effects were observed during the treatment or posttreatment period. Supplemental CLA was effective in reducing milk fat content, but it did not have a significant effect on milk yield or net energy balance.</abstract>

During each of 3 periods, cows were offered 1 of 3 diets that were chemically similar but varied in peNDF content (high, medium, and low) by altering corn silage particle length. The peNDF contents were determined using the Penn State Particle Separator and were 11.5, 10.3, and 8.9%, for the high, medium, and low diets, respectively, and the physical effectiveness factors for the long, medium, and fine silages were 84.1, 72.6, and 67.2%, respectively. Increased forage particle length increased intake of peNDF but did not affect intakes of nutrients including dry matter, NDF, starch, and nitrogen. Except for starch, apparent digestibilities of nutrients in the total tract were linearly increased with increasing dietary peNDF. Fiber digestion was affected by dietary peNDF to a greater extent than were the other nutrients. However, increased digestibility due to increased dietary peNDF did not significantly improve milk production or milk composition. Increased dietary peNDF also increased numerically rumen microbial protein synthesis due to increased amount of organic matter fermented in the rumen. These results indicate that increasing the peNDF content of a corn silage based diet improves digestibility, especially digestibility of fiber, in the total tract. Dietary particle size, expressed as peNDF, is positively associated with nutrient digestibility when level of peNDF in the diet is low.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of Rumen-Degradable Protein Balance and Forage Type on Bulk Milk Urea Concentration and Emission of Ammonia from Dairy Cow Houses.</title>
    <abstract>As the Dutch government and dairy farming sector have given priority to reducing ammonia emission, the effect of diet on the ammonia emission from dairy cow barns was studied. In addition, the usefulness of milk urea content as an indicator of emission reduction was evaluated. An experiment was carried out with a herd of 55 to 57 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows housed in a naturally ventilated barn with cubicles and a slatted floor. The experiment was designed as a 3 x 3 factorial trial and repeated 3 times. During the experiment, cows were confined to the barn (no grazing) and were fed ensiled forages and additional concentrates. The default forage was grass silage. The nutritional experimental factors were: (1) rumen-degradable protein balance of the ration for lactating cows with 3 levels (0, 500, and 1000 g/cow per d), and (2) proportion of corn silage in the forage ration for lactating cows with 3 levels (0, 50, and 100%) of forage dry matter intake. Several series of dynamic regression models were fitted. One of these models explained emission of ammonia by the nutritional factors and the temperature; another model explained ammonia emission by the bulk milk urea content and the temperature. The ammonia emission from the barn increased when levels of rumen-degradable protein balance increased. Furthermore, at a given level of rumen-degradable protein balance, the emission of ammonia correlated positively with the corn silage content in the forage ration. However, this correlation was not causal, but was the result of interaction between corn silage proportion and intake of ileal digestible protein. The bulk milk urea content and the temperature correlated strongly with the ammonia emission from the barn; the selected model accounted for 76% of the variance in emission. It was concluded that the emission of ammonia from naturally ventilated dairy cow barns was strongly influenced by diet. The emission can be reduced approximately 50% by reducing the rumen-degradable protein balance of the ration from 1000 to 0 g/cow per d. The milk urea content is a good indicator of emission reduction.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of Body Fatness and Glucogenic Supplement on Lipid and Protein Mobilization and Plasma Leptin in Dairy Cows.</title>
    <abstract>Twenty-four multiparous Ayrshire cows were used in an experiment to test the effect of body fatness and glucogenic supplement, fed during the transition period, on lipid and protein mobilization and plasma hormone concentrations. Eight weeks before their expected calving date, the cows were divided into blocks of 4. Two cows with the highest body condition score within each block were then allocated to a test (T) group and the other 2 cows to a control (C) group. To scale up the differences between fatter and thinner cows, the estimated energy allowance was 40% higher in group T than in group C between d 56 and 21 prepartum. For the final 3 wk before calving, all the cows were fed according to energy recommendations for pregnant cows. Within C and T groups and blocks, cows were randomly assigned into groups with (G1) or without (G0) glucogenic supplement. Division to G0 and G1 groups was made 2 wk before the expected calving and continued for 56 d postpartum. After calving, all the cows received grass silage ad libitum and a common daily concentrate allowance. No significant differences were detected in feed intake and milk yield between C and T. The T groups showed an earlier rise of nonesterified fatty acids as calving approached and had higher plasma nonesterified fatty acids during the final week of pregnancy and lactation wk 1 to 3. At the same time, adipose tissue samples from fatter cows tended to show higher in vitro lipolytic responses to added norepinephrine, as monitored by glycerol release. Protein mobilization was elevated during the final week of pregnancy and tended to be more increased in fatter cows. Glucogenic supplement did not decrease lipid or protein mobilization. Fatter cows had higher plasma leptin concentration prepartum, showed a more pronounced decrease in leptin concentration near calving, and had higher plasma leptin concentration after calving. In conclusion, fatter cows initiated more extensive mobilization of body fat before calving and this continued during the first lactation weeks. Plasma leptin concentration in early-lactation cows was associated with body fatness and not with estimated energy balance.</abstract>

    <title>Detection of Different Shapes of Lactation Curve for Milk Yield in Dairy Cattle by Empirical Mathematical Models.</title>
    <abstract>The study of relationships between mathematical properties of functions used to model lactation curves is usually limited to the evaluation of the goodness of fit. Problems related to the existence of different lactation curve shapes are usually neglected or solved drastically by considering shapes markedly different from the standard as biologically atypical. A deeper investigation could yield useful indications for developing technical tools aimed at modifying the lactation curve in a desirable fashion. Relationships between mathematical properties and lactation curve shapes were analyzed by fitting several common functions (Wood incomplete gamma, Wilmink's exponential, Ali and Schaeffer's polynomial regression, and fifth-order Legendre polynomials) to 229,518 test-day records belonging to 27,837 lactations of Italian Simmental cows. Among the best fits (adjusted r² higher than 0.75), the 3-parameter models (Wood and Wilmink) were able to detect 2 main groups of curve shape: standard and atypical. Five-parameter models (Ali and Schaeffer function and the Legendre polynomials) were able to recognize a larger number of curve shapes. The higher flexibility of 5-parameter models was accompanied by increased sensitivity to local random variation as evidenced by the bias in estimated test-day yields at the beginning and end of lactation (border effect). Meaning of parameters, range of their values and of their (co) variances are clearly different among groups of curves. Our results suggest that analysis based on comparisons between parameter values and (co)variances should be done carefully. Comparisons among parameter values and (co)variances could yield more robust, reliable, and easy to interpret results if performed within groups based on curve shape.</abstract>

    <title>Association of the Protease Inhibitor Gene with Production Traits in Holstein Dairy Cattle.</title>
    <abstract>Positional, comparative candidate gene analysis and previous quantitative trait loci linkage mapping results were used to search for candidate genes affecting milk production and reproduction traits in dairy cattle. The protease inhibitor (PI) gene was chosen for examination, and 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in coding regions of the gene by direct sequencing of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products from a wide range of cattle tissues. A total of 6 different intragenic haplotypes were identified in North American Holstein population, and these were examined for associations with milk production traits in 24 half-sib families comprising 1007 sons utilizing a granddaughter design. One common haplotype was associated with increased milk and fat yields, increased productive life, and decreased somatic cell score. Another common haplotype was associated with decreased productive life and increased somatic cell score. One rare haplotype was associated with decreased milk, fat, and protein yields and increased milk protein percentage; another rare haplotype was associated with decreased milk yield, increased protein percentage, and decreased productive life. The observation that the PI gene is associated with analogous traits in humans demonstrates the effectiveness of the positional comparative candidate gene analysis that utilizes information about genes present in chromosomal regions with conserved synteny in other species.</abstract>

    <title>The Interaction of Strain of Holstein-Friesian Cows and Pasture-Based Feed Systems on Milk Yield, Body Weight, and Body Condition Score.</title>
    <abstract>Interactions between genotype and environment are becoming increasingly important as cattle genotypes are being managed in a diverse range of environments worldwide. The objective of this study was to investigate if there is an interaction of strain of Holstein-Friesian cows (HF) by grass-based feed system that affects milk production, body weight, and body condition score. Three strains of HF were compared on 3 pasture-based feed systems over 3 consecutive years. The 3 strains of HF were: high production North American, high durability North American, and New Zealand. The 3 grass-based feeding systems (FS) were: a high grass allowance system (MPFS), a high concentrate system (HCFS), and a high stocking rate system (HSFS). There was a separate farmlet for each FS and a total of 99, 117, and 117 animals were used in yr 1, 2, and 3 respectively, divided equally between strains of HF and FS. The high production cows produced the highest yield of milk, the New Zealand the lowest, and the high durability animals were intermediate. Milk fat and protein content were higher for the New Zealand strain than for the high production and high durability strains. The New Zealand strain had the lowest body weight and the highest condition score, whereas the high durability strain had the highest body weight, and the high production strain had the lowest condition score. There was a strain x FS interaction for yield of milk, fat, and protein. The milk production response to increased concentrate supplementation (MPFS vs. HCFS) was greater with both the high production and high durability strains (1.10 kg of milk/kg of concentrate for high production; 1.00 kg of milk/kg of concentrate for high durability) than the New Zealand strain (0.55 kg of milk/kg of concentrate). The results indicate that the optimum strain of HF will vary with feed system.</abstract>

    <title>Selection Indices in Holstein Cattle of Various Countries.</title>
    <abstract>Fifteen countries, based on geographical representation, Interbull membership, and size of progeny testing programs, provided a brief description of national selection index and top bull listings from August 2003. Individual traits included in each selection index were grouped into 3 components as they related to production, durability, and health and reproduction. The relative emphasis for each component within the selection index, as well as the number of common bulls among top listings were compared across countries. Average relative emphasis for production, durability, and health and reproduction, across all countries, was 59.5, 28, and 12.5%, respectively. The main difference between selection indices in various countries was the relative emphasis on production. Overall, the Danish S-Index had the most balanced emphasis across the 3 components, with 34% on production, 29% on durability, and 37% on health and reproduction. Broadening of breeding goals through recent changes to selection indices decreased the similarities of top bull listings across the various countries, with a slightly greater commonality among sires of top bulls.</abstract>

    <title>Performance of Lactating Dairy Cows Managed on Pasture-Based or in Freestall Barn-Feeding Systems.</title>
    <abstract>The objective was to compare productive and metabolic responses of lactating dairy cows managed on 2 pasture-based systems using a concentrate supplement (n = 16) with those of a freestall housing system (n = 24). In a 259-d experiment, 3 multiparous Holstein cows were assigned at calving to each of 4 replicates of 2 pasture systems. For system 1, winter pastures were a mixture of rye, ryegrass, and crimson and red clover; summer pastures were pearl millet. Pasture system 2 included a rye-ryegrass mixture during winter and bermudagrass during summer. Pregraze herbage mass averaged 2.3 and 3.6 Mg/ha for winter and summer pastures, respectively; however, during August through September, pearl millet pregraze mass was reduced to about 1 Mg/ha. Daily dry matter intake by cows on pasture averaged 24.7 kg/d in winter and 19.0 kg/d in summer, of which 55% was from pasture; that of cows in confined-housing averaged 23.6 kg/d. Cows in confinement produced 19% more milk (29.8 vs. 25.1 kg/d) than those on pasture systems. Differences in concentration of milk fat, protein, or urea N were not detected among treatment groups. Grazing cows lost more body weight than confined cows (113 vs. 58 kg) and had lower concentrations of plasma glucose in the early weeks postpartum. Despite greater milk yield by cows housed in freestalls, milk income minus feed costs including that of pasture was similar for the 3 management systems. Although these pasture systems might be a viable management system in the southeastern US, extensive loss of body weight immediately postpartum for pasture-based cows are a potential concern.</abstract>

    <title>Lodgepole pine site index in relation to synoptic measures of climate, soil moisture and soil nutrients.</title>
    <abstract>Lodgepole pine site index was examined in relation to synoptic measures of topography, soil moisture, and soil nutrients in Alberta. Data came from 214 lodgepole pine-dominated stands sampled as a part of the provincial permanent sample plot program. Spatial location (elevation, latitude, and longitude) and natural subregions (NSRs) were topographic variables that might be considered as synoptic measures of climate. Soil moisture regimes (SMRs) were used as synoptic measures of soil moisture supply. Soil nutrient regimes (SNRs) were used as synoptic measures of soil nutrient supply. Simple measures of geographic location (elevation, latitude, longitude) carried the most predictive power, explaining between 33% and 37% of the variation. Site index decreased with elevation, increased with latitude, and had a quadratic relationship with longitude. The Lower Foothills NSR had higher site index (16.1 m) than the Upper Foothills (14.0 m), Montane (11.8 m) and Subalpine (10.3 m) NSRs. Soil moisture regime variables were not significant. Soil nutrient regime variables were also not important, although one was significant in conjunction with elevation, latitude, and longitude (41% explained variation). Standard errors of estimate ranged between 2.64 and 2.94 m for the various synoptic models. Interaction terms between synoptic variables were examined but were found to be non-significant.</abstract>

    <title>The apparent digestibility of phytate phosphorus and the influence of supplemental phytase in horses.</title>
    <abstract>Availability of phytate-bound P as influenced by supplemental phytase was studied in eight horses consuming four diets in a 4 x 4 Latin square design experiment. The treatments were a control (containing a low P level, 18.4 g/d) and three high-P diets. These diets contained P as monocalcium phosphate (MCP; 43.7 g/d), myoinositol hexakisphosphate in the form of wheat and rice bran (MIHP; 41.8 g/d), or MIHP with microbial phytase (MIHPP; 42.5 g/d). The proportions of phytate-bound P were 3, 1, 55, and 56% for the control, MCP, MIHP, and MIHPP, respectively. The MIHPP diet was supplemented with 300 phytase units (FTU)/kg (as-fed basis). Feces and urine were collected quantitatively and analyzed for P, Ca, and Mg. Urinary P excretion was lower (P < 0.05) with the control diet (0 g of P/d) than with the MCP diet (1.0 g of P/d). The low urinary P excretion (0.3 g of P/d) for the MIHP diet suggested low P availability compared with the MCP diet, but apparent digestibility of P expressed as a percentage of intake did not differ (P = 0.065) between these diets. Apparent Ca digestibility was lower (P < 0.05) for the MIHP diet than for the MCP diet (26.4 vs. 42.4%). This difference may have been caused by the origin of the Ca in these diets. Phytase supplementation increased apparent Ca digestibility from 26.4 to 31.5% (P < 0.05). Magnesium was not influenced by the level of phytate in the diet. Our data indicate that phytase supplementation had more influence on Ca digestibility than on P digestibility and suggest that phytase supplementation may be beneficial for improving Ca digestibility for horses receiving a phytate-rich diet.</abstract>

    <title>Leaving forest strips in large clearcut landscapes of boreal forest: a management scenario suitable for wildlife?</title>
    <abstract>Riparian forest strips (RS) along lakes and streams have been incorporated in regulations on clearcuts to protect water quality and fish habitat. As well, upland strips (US) are used to limit the size of clearcut patches. We conducted a three-year study to evaluate if RS and US between adjacent cutovers in large clearcut landscapes could be useful for certain terrestrial wildlife. Our study was conducted in southcentral Quebec on six landscapes (23-256 km2) originating from black spruce (Picea mariana) forests that were recently logged (less than or equal to 9 years). Residual uncut forest, mostly strips (width = 51-132 m), made up 31% of the productive forest area within these landscapes. RS and US were suitable habitat for red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and many species of birds including spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis). They provided marginal habitat for snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and were not preferred by moose (Alces alces) over clearcut areas in winter. One bird species, bay-breasted warbler (Dendroica castanea), was absent in forest strips during the last year. We concluded that leaving RS and US is a management scenario that enables maintaining certain wildlife species within clearcut landscapes, but that larger residual forest patches are needed to accommodate area-sensitive and forest-interior species. A portion of these patches should be allowed to develop into mature and overmature stages for old-growth forest species. Green tree and dead tree retention should also be incorporated in logging practices to accommodate species that need snags for nesting or feeding. In areas where wildlife use has a high priority, large clearcuts should be intermixed with dispersed patch cutting in order to gain social acceptance.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of forest management practices on red-shouldered hawks in Ontario.</title>
    <abstract>The red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) is a species of special concern throughout its northern range. It is considered to be sensitive to forest management practices because it requires dense mature hardwood forest for nesting. In Ontario, guidelines that prescribe spatial and temporal buffers were developed in about 1990 to mitigate the potential impacts of harvesting. We monitored 84 nesting areas of red-shouldered hawks in central and southeastern Ontario from 1988 to 1995 to describe the effects of forest management practices on the occupancy and productivity of nesting areas, to evaluate the effectiveness of the guidelines, and recommend modifications as appropriate. The number of years nesting areas had been used previously had a significant negative effect on activity status, but not on nest success. Nesting areas harvested with application of the guidelines had a similar probability of being active to those in uncut forest but nesting areas harvested without application of the guidelines did not. Neither the area nor proximity of selection cuts with a moderate to high residual basal area (greater than or equal to 18 m2/ha) affected the activity status of nesting areas. In contrast, the area and proximity of heavy cuts (shelterwood cuts or selection cuts with a residual basal area of 14-16 m2/ha) appeared to have a negative effect on activity status. When nesting areas were active, the proximity and amount of harvesting did not influence nest success. We concluded that the impact of harvesting on the activity status of nesting areas could be mitigated by prohibiting heavy cuts within 300 m of active nests and retaining greater than or equal to 20 ha of forest dominated by tolerant and mid-tolerant hardwood trees, greater than or equal to 18 m tall, with greater than or equal to 70% canopy closure around nests.</abstract>

    <title>Birds as indicators of sustainable forest management.</title>
    <abstract>This paper discusses the potential of birds as indicators of sustainable forest management. Several reviews have been critical of birds as indicators of environmental change, and we discuss the major criticisms in the context of forest management. We address these criticisms by suggesting alternative approaches for an indicator research program including the use of focussed studies to identify cause-and-effect relationships, habitat modelling to act as a surrogate to extensive monitoring of populations, and spatially-explicit population modelling (1) to conduct exploratory sensitivity analysis to identify the most important parameters; (2) to incorporate the spatial configuration of habitat into consideration of the impacts of management; (3) to anticipate future impacts as an alternative to measuring past impacts; (4) and, as a means of evaluating alternative management scenarios including natural disturbance regimes. Birds are unlikely to be able to act as a precise tool for the measurement of some forest condition, but they could be useful indicators of sustainable forest management as part of an iterative research program.</abstract>

    <title>Guiding principles for developing an indicator and monitoring framework.</title>
    <abstract>Sustainable forest management ideally involves five elements: 1) establishing a clear set of values, goals and objectives and, 2) planning actions that are most likely to meet desired goals and objectives, 3) implementing appropriate management activities, 4) monitoring the outcomes to check on predictions, effectiveness, and assumptions, and 5) evaluating and adjusting management depending on the outcome of monitoring. Within this framework, indicators are used to determine whether the outcome of management has met the intended goals. In this paper we provide general guidance for developing an integrated and logical monitoring system, define and differentiate between "evaluative" and "prescriptive" indicators, provide more specific advice on choosing evaluative indicators (including a comparison of types of ecological indicators), and provide specific advice on defining prescriptive indicators. Our guidelines for developing an indicator and monitoring framework are based on three principles. The first principle is to develop a logical framework, including 1) establishing clear values and goals before setting indicators and objectives, and 2) linking prescriptive and evaluative indicators directly to plan objectives, and to each other. The second principal is to use the framework to learn adaptively by: 1) designing management activities to address specific questions, 2) learning about thresholds, and 3) testing assumptions. The third principal is to create a formal plan for learning.</abstract>

    <title>Forests and forest protection in Cyprus.</title>
    <abstract>Cyprus, an island located in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, was heavily forested prior to human settlement. Human influence since about 6000 BC has significantly changed the area and composition of the island's forests. Approximately 40% of the Island is presently occupied by forest, maquis and garigue vegetation. The dominant tree species in Cyprus' forests is Pinus brutia, which has been planted extensively on abandoned agricultural lands and areas burned by wildfire. P. brutia forests are subject to periodic wildfire episodes. In addition, young plantations are subject to defoliation by the pine processionary caterpillar, Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera: Pityocampidae), and older forests are subject to attack by several species of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). A policy of extensive planting of pines will, most likely, result in continued problems with wildfire, pine processionary caterpillar and bark beetles in the foreseeable future. Long-term measures to effectively manage these problems include examination of opportunities to plant alternative tree species and to manage the vegetation to increase the diversity of the Island's wildland ecosystems.</abstract>

    <title>A proposed framework for developing an integrated growth and yield monitoring system for Alberta.</title>
    <abstract>A province-wide growth and yield (GY) monitoring program, composed of three data collection systems, is proposed for Alberta for the main purpose of verifying GY predictions for various stand types. The first system, based on the 20-km grid proposed for the National Forest Inventory, is recommended for collecting monitoring data on GY predictions for untreated, natural-origin stands. A denser, 10-km grid is recommended for the second system for monitoring GY predictions for untreated, post-harvest stands. The third system is designed for monitoring GY predictions for silviculturally treated stands. The sample plots for the third system will be randomly selected from eligible stands. To enable comparison of site index estimates between natural-origin and post-harvest stands, paired plots are recommended whenever possible in the second system. In the first phase, 500 installations each for untreated natural-origin and post-harvest stands, and 250 installations for silviculturally treated natural-origin and post-harvest stands, are proposed. Detailed plot designs are presented, along with the planned implementation strategies.</abstract>

    <title>The influence of site tree selection method on site index determination and yield prediction in black spruce stands in northeastern Quebec.</title>
    <abstract>Site index is a common and convenient indicator of forest site productivity. The concept is well suited for growth and yield predictions, although there appears to be no universal consensus on the type or number of site trees needed for its application. We compared four methods for assessing site quality using data from black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) stands of northeastern Quebec. Data were analysed with a univariate repeated measures analysis of variance design using the MIXED procedure of the SAS system. Significant differences were found between the method based on the mean height of the 100 largest trees per hectare and three other methods that calculate site index using information from average site trees (codominants and dominants) and an equation to estimate top height from stand level data. We concur with many others that using the mean height of the 100 largest trees per hectare is a more standard procedure than simple averages of codominant and dominant tree heights for site quality assessment and growth modelling. We recommend that the next yield table system developed in the province should be based on top height trees, instead of using average codominants and dominants and an equation to estimate dominant height.</abstract>

    <title>Changes in plasma ghrelin and growth hormone concentrations in mature Holstein cows and three-month-old calves.</title>
    <abstract>We measured changes in plasma ghrelin and GH concentrations in mature Holstein cows and 3-mo-old female Holstein calves fed at scheduled times. Our objective was to determine the characteristics of ghrelin secretion in dairy cattle and its influence on GH. Animals were fed at 0800 and 1600 for 2 wk before and during experiments. Plasma was sampled for 24 h at 2-h intervals in Exp. 1. In mature cows, plasma ghrelin concentrations decreased (P < 0.01) just after 0800 but not at the 1600 feeding. Ghrelin concentrations were lower (P < 0.01) in calves than in mature cows and they did not decrease after feeding in calves. The temporal relationship between ghrelin and GH remained unclear. In Exp. 2, plasma was sampled 2 h before and after both morning and evening feedings at 20-min intervals. Plasma ghrelin concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) 40 min after 0800 feeding and 60 min after 1600 feeding in mature cows. These results indicate that in mature cows, plasma ghrelin concentration decreased after feeding, but this decrease was not evident in 3-mo-old calves. Further studies are required to define the relationship between plasma ghrelin and GH concentrations.</abstract>

    <title>Bovine metalloprotease characterization and in vitro connective tissue degradation.</title>
    <abstract>Metalloproteases that selectively hydrolyze connective tissue proteins may tenderize meat without creating texture problems associated with myofibrillar protein degradation. Our objective was to characterize the activity of bovine placental proteases to determine whether they can improve meat tenderness through disruption of the connective tissue matrix. Enzymes were extracted, crudely purified, and proteolytic activity was assessed against gelatin and collagen under varying pH and temperature conditions using both SDS-PAGE and zymography. Gelatin zymography revealed proteolysis between 57 and 63 kDa, with decreased activity as buffer pH decreased from pH 7.4 to 5.4 (37 degrees C). Proteolytic activity was pronounced at 37 degrees C, moderate at 25 degrees C, and absent at 4 degrees C following 48-h incubation (pH 7.4). Placental enzymes were metalloproteases inhibited by excess EDTA. Maximum proteolysis was achieved in the presence of Ca(2+), with or without Mg(2+) and Zn(2+). Absence of Ca(2+) decreased proteolytic activity. Complete degradation of both the 125- and 120-kDa proteins of the alpha-chains of gelatin was achieved following enzyme incubation for 6 h at 37 degrees C or 24 h at 25 degrees C. No degradation was observed following enzyme incubation with native Type I collagen. Given the marked decrease in enzyme activity at pH 5.4 and 4 degrees C (standard industry conditions), bovine placental metalloproteases would not be expected to contribute to connective tissue degradation or improve meat tenderness.</abstract>

    <title>A comparison of progestin-based protocols to synchronize estrus in postpartum beef cows.</title>
    <abstract>Two progestin-based protocols for estrus synchronization in postpartum beef cows were compared following treatment administration on the basis of estrous response, interval to and synchrony of estrus, and pregnancy. Cows were assigned to one of the two treatment protocols by age, body condition score (BCS), and days postpartum (DPP). The MGA Select-treated cows (MGA Select; n = 109) were fed melengestrol acetate (MGA; 0.5mg.cow(-1).d(-1)) for 14 d, fed carrier for 8 d, GnRH (100 microgram of Cystorelin) was injected i.m. 12 d after MGA withdrawal, and PG (25 mg of Lutalyse) was administered i.m. 7 d after GnRH. Cows assigned to the 7-11 Synch protocol (7-11 Synch; n = 111) were fed carrier for 15 d, fed MGA for 7 d, injected with PG on d 22 (d 7 of MGA), injected with GnRH on d 26, and injected with PG on d 33. Mean BCS (4.8 +/- 0.1, MGA Select; 4.7 +/- 0.1, 7-11 Synch) and DPP (40 +/- 1, MGA Select; 40 +/- 1, 7-11 Synch) did not differ between treatments. Blood samples were collected 8 d and 1 d before feeding of MGA or carrier to determine the pretreatment estrous cyclicity (progesterone greater than or equal to 1 ng/mL; 10/109 [9%], MGA Select; 12/111 [11%], 7-11 Synch), and again at PG on d 33 to evaluate treatment response (81/109 [74%], MGA Select; 84/111 (76%), 7-11 Synch). Serum concentrations of progesterone at PG on d 33 differed (P < 0.01) between treatments (3.3 +/- 0.3 ng/mL [MGA Select] vs. 1.7 +/- 0.1 ng/mL [7-11 Synch]). HeatWatch was used for 6 d after PG on d 33 to detect estrus, and AI was performed 12 h after the onset of estrus. Estrous response did not differ between treatments (100/109 [92%], MGA Select; 101/111 [91%], 7-11 Synch). Mean interval to estrus (65 +/- 2.7 h, MGA Select; 52 +/- 1.8 h, 7-11 Synch) and synchrony of estrus differed (P < 0.01) between treatments. Synchronized conception and pregnancy rates (61/100 [61%], 61/109 [56%], MGA Select; 71/101 [70%], 71/111 [64%], 7-11 Synch), and final pregnancy rates (94/109 [86%], MGA Select; 99/110 [90%], 7-11 Synch) did not differ between treatments. In summary, estrous response and fertility did not differ among cows assigned to the MGA Select or 7-11 Synch protocols. Synchrony of estrus, defined as the variance in the interval to estrus from PG, however, was improved following treatment with the 7-11 Synch protocol.</abstract>

    <title>Characteristics of calves produced with sperm sexed by flow cytometry/cell sorting.</title>
    <abstract>The objectives of this study were to determine whether calves produced by sexed sperm differed from controls and to what extent the sex ratio of calves was altered by the sexing procedure. Data were collected from 1,169 calves produced from sperm sexed by flow cytometry/cell sorting after staining with Hoechst 33342, and 793 calves produced from control sperm during breeding trials between 1997 and 2001. Least squares ANOVA were completed using factors of treatment (sexed vs. control sperm), 19 management groups from 13 field trials, and calf sex. Responses analyzed include gestation length, birth weight, calving ease, calf vigor, weaning weight, abortion rate, and death rates (neonatal and through weaning). No significant difference was observed for any response due to treatment or treatment interactions (P > 0.10). Therefore, calves produced from sexed sperm grew and developed normally both pre- and postnatally. A neurological disorder was observed in four control calves and one sexed calf from one farm. No gross anatomical abnormalities were reported for any calves in the study. Differences were observed for all responses among management groups (P < 0.03 for abortions and P < 0.01 for all other responses). Heifer and bull calves differed (P < 0.001) in gestation length (278.4 and 279.6 d), birth weight (32.8 and 35.2 kg), calving ease (1.15 and 1.30), and weaning weight (233 and 247 kg). Gestation length did not affect characteristics of calves. The sex ratio at birth of calves from unsexed control sperm was 49.2% male. Sexing accuracy of X-sorted sperm was 87.8% female calves, and Y-sorted sperm produced 92.1% male calves. Flow cytometry/cell sorting can be used to preselect sex of calves safely with approximately 90% accuracy.</abstract>

    <title>Copper proteinale in weanling pig diets for enhancing growth performance and reducing fecal copper excretion compared with copper sulfate.</title>
    <abstract>Two 28-d experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of low dietary concentrations of Cu as Cu-proteinate compared with 250 ppm Cu as CuSO4 with growth performance, plasma Cu concentrations, and Cu balance of weanling swine as the criteria. In the production study (Exp. 1), 240 crossbred pigs that averaged 19.8 d of age and 6.31 kg BW initially were group-fed (two or three pigs per pen) the basal diets (Phase 1: d 0 to 14 and Phase 2: d 14 to 28) supplemented with 0 (control), 25, 50, 100, or 200 ppm Cu as Cu-proteinate, or 250 ppm Cu as CuSO4 (as-fed basis). The basal diets contained 16.5 ppm Cu supplied as CuSO4 before supplementation with Cu-proteinate or 250 ppm Cu as CuSO4. There were quadratic responses (P less than or equal to 0.05) in ADFI and ADG for wk 1, Phases 1 and 2, and overall because ADFI was higher for pigs fed 25 or 50 ppm Cu as Cu-proteinate, and ADG increased with increasing Cu-proteinate up to 50 ppm Cu. The Cu-proteinate treatment groups combined had a higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) Phase 2 and overall ADFI and ADG than the CuSO4 group. In the mineral balance study (Exp. 2), 20 crossbred barrows that averaged 35 d of age and 11.2 kg/BW initially were placed in individual metabolism pens with total urine and fecal grab sample collections on d 22 to 26. Treatments were the basal Phase 2 diet supplemented with 0, 50, or 100 ppm Cu as Cu-proteinate, or 250 ppm Cu as CuSO4 (as-fed basis). Treatments did not differ in growth performance criteria. There were linear increases (P < 0.001) in Cu absorption, retention, and excretion (milligrams per day) with increasing Cu-proteinate. Pigs fed 100 ppm Cu as Cu-proteinate absorbed and retained more Cu and excreted less Cu (mg/d, P less than or equal to 0.003) than pigs fed 250 ppm Cu as CuSO4. Plasma Cu concentrations increased linearly (P = 0.06) with increasing Cu-proteinate. In conclusion, weanling pig growth performance was increased by 50 or 100 ppm Cu as Cu-proteinate in our production Exp. 1, but not in our balance Exp. 2, compared with 250 ppm Cu as CuSO4. However, 50 or 100 ppm Cu as Cu-proteinate increased Cu absorption and retention, and decreased Cu excretion 77 and 61%, respectively, compared with 250 ppm Cu as CuSO4.</abstract>

    <title>Balance and serum concentration of biotin in sheep fed alfalfa meal-based diets with increasing level of concentrate.</title>
    <abstract>The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that serum biotin concentration and biotin balance (consumed - [urinary output + fecal output]) measured as total avidin-binding substances (biotin + biotin metabolites) are responsive to changes in the proportions of dietary alfalfa meal and concentrate fed to sheep. Eight sheep (initial BW = 40 kg) consumed a pelleted alfalfa meal-based diet that had 95:5, 48:52, 23:77, or 9:91% alfalfa meal:concentrate ratios (DM basis) in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design with 20-d periods (10 d of acclimation, 7 d of adaptation, and a 3-d collection period with jugular blood drawn on the last day). Replacing alfalfa meal with concentrate in the pelleted diets decreased dietary concentrations of biotin proportionally. As the percentage of alfalfa meal in the diet decreased, there was a linear decrease in daily DM intake (1,128 to 901 g of DMI/d; P < 0.01), with a linear (P < 0.01) and quadratic (P < 0.01) increase in the apparent total-tract DM digestibility of diets (51.0 to 80.0%). The biotin consumed decreased with alfalfa meal proportion in the diet (linear, P < 0.01). Both fecal biotin concentration (linear, P < 0.01) and fecal biotin output (quadratic, P < 0.05) increased, reaching peaks at 23% alfalfa meal. Fecal biotin output was not correlated with biotin intake, DMI, or intake of digestible DM. Mean urinary output, urinary biotin concentration, urinary biotin output, and serum biotin concentration were not affected by treatments. Means of biotin balance were negative and revealed the same trends among treatments as did fecal output. Biotin balance was a quadratic (P < 0.05) function of decreasing alfalfa meal in the diet, with more negative values at the alfalfa meal:concentrate ratio of 23:77. Results suggest that the greatest synthesis of biotin in the total digestive tract occurs with diets of either 52 or 77% concentrate for sheep; however, research addressing the significance of biotin metabolites on biotin balance and plasma biotin pool is needed.</abstract>

    <title>Backtest type and housing condition of pigs influence energy metabolism.</title>
    <abstract>The behavioral response of piglets in a backtest early in life seems indicative of their coping strategy at a later age. Coping characteristics may depend on the interaction between backtest classification and housing conditions. We studied whether growth rate and partitioning of energy in adult gilts were related to response in the backtest early in life, and to housing in groups or individual stalls. During the suckling period, female piglets were subjected to the backtest. Each piglet was restrained on its back for 1 min, and the number of escape attempts was scored. Thirty-six high-resisting gilts and 36 low-resisting gilts were selected. After weaning, pigs were housed in 12 groups of six (three high-resisting and three low-resisting). From 7 mo of age onward, 36 gilts out of six groups were housed in individual stalls, whereas the other gilts remained group housed. At 13 mo of age, gilts were housed in clusters of three (three high-resisting or three low-resisting) for an experimental period of 7 d in climatic respiration chambers. Group-housed gilts were loose housed, and stall-housed gilts were housed in stalls within the chamber. Despite the fact that high-resisting and low-resisting gilts did not differ (P = 0.269) in initial BW, low-resisting gilts showed a higher (P = 0.039) ADG during the experimental period in association with a higher (P = 0.043) energy metabolizability. This suggests that, in line with the theory on coping strategies, high-resisting gilts may have more difficulties in adapting to a change in environment, (i.e., the change from home pen to climatic chamber). Group- and stall-housed gilts differed (P = 0.001) in initial BW, with group-housed gilts being heavier. During the experimental period, stall-housed gilts showed lower energy metabolizability (P = 0.001), lower energy retention (P = 0.001), and a higher energy requirement for maintenance (P = 0.001) due to a higher activity-related heat production (P = 0.001). This finding suggests that stall housing might have a negative influence on performance and partitioning of energy when animals are adapting to a change in their environment.</abstract>

    <title>Computer image analysis for measuring lean and fatty areas in cross-sectioned dry-cured hams.</title>
    <abstract>The aims of this study were 1) to apply computer image analysis to obtain measures of lean and fatty areas on the cross section of dry-cured hams, 2) to investigate variation of these measures, and 3) to evaluate reproducibility and repeatability of these techniques. Traits of concern were the cross-sectional area (SA), lean, or muscles, area (LA), and the fatty area (FA) centered on the cross section and surrounded by biceps femoris, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and quadriceps femoris, as well as the FA-to-SA ratio (FESR). Hams were obtained from crossbred pigs (n = 279) slaughtered at 9 mo of age (mean BW of 169 +/- 17 kg). Digital images of the cross section of dry-cured hams were captured using standardized procedures. Three replicated measures of areas were collected by three operators using three image analysis techniques (automatic, automatic-assisted, and manual). Variance components were estimated using a linear model that included slaughter group, gender, and gender x slaughter group as fixed effects and operators, pig, and operator x pig as random effects. Statistical analyses considered all measures (n = 7,533) or measures collected after reinstruction of all operators for spatial calibration of the analysis system (n = 4,428). Average SA, LA, FA, and FESR were 350 cm2, 220 cm2, 8.7 cm2, and 2.5%, respectively. Variability of FA (CV = 42%) and of FESR (CV = 39%) was four times greater than that of SA and LA. Slaughter group, pig, operator, and operator x pig effects were the most (P < 0.01) important sources of variation of measures. Correlations between measures obtained with different techniques were greater (P < 0.01) than 0.90, with the exception of LA measures. Coefficients of reproducibility for SA and LA ranged from 87 to 94%, whereas those for FA and FESR ranged from 88 to 98%. Coefficients of repeatability ranged from 92 to 99%. Automatic-assisted and manual methods provided more reproducible and repeatable measures than the automatic technique. Spatial calibration of the software system was a key issue affecting reproducibility and repeatability. Reinstructing the analysts for spatial calibration enhanced both reproducibility and repeatability of all methods of analysis. Computer image analysis is a technique suitable for measuring lean and fatty areas in cross-sectioned hams, providing reproducible and repeatable measures, and it might be used in large sample-based studies to investigate causes of defective fatty areas.</abstract>

    <title>Explanation of the relationships between seed yield and some morphological traits in smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) by path analysis.</title>
    <abstract>Path analysis was performed on plant characters in a sward of smooth bromegrass to determine the seed yield, the direct and indirect effects of the following seed yield components: stem yield/m2, total stem number/m2, fertile stem number/m2, sterile stem number/m2, percentage of fertile stem, seeds/m2, seeds/panicle, seed weight/panicle, 1000-seed weight, and plant height under field conditions. Seed yield was significantly correlated with all components except 1000-seed weight, total stem number/m2, and seed weight/panicle. Stem yield/m2, percentage of fertile stem, sterile stem number/m2 and seeds/m2 had substantial direct effects, in that order, on enhancement of seed yield. The significant positive correlation coefficients of fertile stem number/m2 and plant height with seed yield resulted from positive indirect effects of stem yield/m2 and percentage of fertile stem. Conversely, the significant negative correlation between sterile stem number/m2 and seed yield resulted from negative indirect effects of the same two components. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that 54.9% of total variation in seed yield could be explained by the variation in stem yield/m2 and by fertile stem number/m2 (51.4 and 3.5%, respectively). Results suggest that stem yield/m2 and fertile stem number/m2 are primary selection criteria for improving seed yield in the sward of smooth bromegrass.</abstract>

    <title>Comparison of local and exotic maize varieties for stalk lodging components in a desert climate.</title>
    <abstract>A 2-year study on the influence of certain plant morphological traits as well as the chemical composition of the stalk on lodging in exotic and local maize groups was done at Sultan Qaboos University. The exotic group consisted of six varieties, while five varieties were represented in the local group. The soil type was classified as saline, the EC being 3.9-4.2 dS/m. In both maize groups, lodging was negatively correlated with grain yield, rind thickness and stalk breaking strength. Weight of 5-cm stalk section was negatively correlated with lodging in the local group but the exotic group showed no such correlation. In the exotic group, lodging was positively correlated with ear height and negatively correlated with stalk lignin and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration but no such correlations were represented in the local group. In a stepwise regression analysis, a four-variable model consisting of shelling percentage, stalk breaking strength, rind thickness and TNC had a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.66, suggesting that 66% of the variability in lodging was due to variability in these characters acting together. Based on this result it was suggested that, in breeding for lodging resistance in maize in a desert climate, it may be worthwhile to focus on these four parameters.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of foliar application of a byproduct of the two-step olive oil mill process on rice yield.</title>
    <abstract>The main objective of this work is to study the effects of foliar fertilization with a byproduct of the two-step olive oil mill process at different dose on rice (Oriza sativa cv. Puntal) production and quality in Villafranco del Guadalquivir, near to Sevilla city (Andalusia, Spain). The obtained results show that the foliar fertilization with a byproduct rich in humic substances (but also containing macro- and micronutrients) increased the leaf concentration of micronutrients Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn, and macronutrients N and K uptake by plants. Highest values of chlorophyll A, B and carotenoids were found in the plots foliar fertilized, which presumably favoured photosynthesis. Foliar application of the byproduct gave significant increases in grain protein concentration of about 22%, grain starch concentration of about 5%, grain yield of about 4% and a significant rice yield of about 6%.</abstract>

    <title>Influence of sulphur supply on yield and quality of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.)--determination of a threshold value.</title>
    <abstract>In the last 20 years, several crops such as oil seed rape and cereals have developed sulphur deficiency symptoms with subsequent yield reductions due to decreasing S deposition. The study aimed at: (1) defining indicators of the S status of sugar beet; and (2) determining threshold values of internal S concentrations which affect yield and quality. For this purpose, the effect of S supply on S concentration and N/S ratio in leaves and on yield and technical quality of sugar beet was analysed. A field survey with 200 sites was conducted and S treatments were performed in 33 field trials and four pot experiments. In the field survey, the mineral S content of the soil in spring had no impact on the S concentration in sugar beet leaves in July. In accordance, there was no effect of S application on yield and quality of sugar beet in the field trials, indicating that S was available in sufficient amounts. In pot experiments, beet yield and sucrose concentration decreased, while potassium, sodium and amino N concentration in the beet considerably increased with extremely low S supply. With S concentrations above 0.3% (range of: 0.28-0.32%) in young leaf blades, which equalled N/S ratios below 20, no changes in yield or quality occurred as a result of S application, indicating that the plants were adequately supplied with sulphur. Plants from field trials and pot experiments reached maximum yields with the same S concentrations in the leaf blades. This good agreement leads to the conclusion that these threshold values do not depend on growing conditions and are, therefore, a general characteristic for sugar beet. S concentration and N/S ratio in the blades of young sugar beet leaves sampled in July are thus suggested as suitable indicators of the plant's S status.</abstract>

    <title>Growth responses of sorghum plants to chilling temperature and duration of exposure.</title>
    <abstract>Sorghum is a species sensitive to chilling temperatures. In the cultivation areas at higher latitudes chilling sensitivity may significantly influence plants growth in early spring, resulting in significant yield reductions. The effects of chilling stress were investigated in a controlled environment experiment on sorghum plants fertilised with 0 and 44 mg per pot of N. Plants were grown at 27 degrees C until eighth leaf development stage, exposed to 2, 5, and 8 degrees C for time period varying from 1 to 8 days, and then returned to 27 degrees C. Dry weight of plants, leaf area and N and P concentration and content were determined before and after each period of cold treatment and after a 10-day recovery period. Plant relative growth rate (RGR), leaf relative growth rate (RLGR) and N and P uptake rates were calculated during the chilling and the recovery period. Chilling treatments greatly inhibited sorghum growth and N uptake during chilling exposure. The nature and severity of chilling damage was a function of the severity and duration of the exposure: plants suffered short chilling injury at all temperatures, when the duration of chilling was prolonged plants were able to react to chilling, but the ability of the plant to adapt decreased with the decrease of temperature. Plant shoot growth was found to be more sensitive to chilling than leaf area growth and non-fertilised plants were more tolerant to chilling than N-fertilised plants. Also the ability of the plant to recover was a function of the severity and duration of the exposure and of N availability. The recovery of growth rate decreased as temperature was lower and as exposure was longer. Non-fertilised plants were able to recover higher growth rates following chilling stress than N-fertilised plants, while for N uptake the reverse was true, with N-fertilised plants having higher N uptake rates than non-fertilised ones.</abstract>

    <title>Frost damage to winter wheat in the UK: the effect of plant population density.</title>
    <abstract>One winter wheat variety, Soissons, suffered extensive frost damage in a plant population density (PPD) and sowing date (SD) experiment in 1997/1998. Another variety, Cadenza, did not incur any frost damage, even though it was at a similar developmental stage to Soissons when the damaging frosts (minimum grass temperatures of -8 and -9 degrees C) occurred. Therefore, in addition to rapid development, other physiological characteristics of Soissons, such as the presence of awns and weak glaucosity must be important in determining its susceptibility to frost damage. When sown on 23 September, the low PPD crops suffered the most frost damage but when sown on 25 October the high PPD crops suffered the most. This challenges the assumption that low PPDs are more resistant to frost than high PPDs. No frost damage was observed in the crop sown on 16 December. Frosts killed spikelets, restricted internode extension (stem growth) and reduced yield. Frosts in April and May, after growth stage (GS) 33, appeared responsible for the damage symptoms observed in the crop. Minimum temperatures in April and May were similar to those recorded in the previous season when no frost damage was observed. There had been a cooler winter in 1996/1997, allowing slower crop development and more cold hardening, therefore the frosts in the spring of 1997 did not inflict obvious damage.</abstract>

    <title>Carbon sequestration in croplands: the potential in Europe and the global context.</title>
    <abstract>Biospheric carbon sinks and sources can be included in attempts to meet emission reduction targets during the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Forest management, cropland management, grazing land management and re-vegetation are allowable activities under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. Soil carbon sinks (and sources) can, therefore, be included under these activities. In this paper, the role of croplands in the European carbon budget and the potential for carbon sequestration in European croplands are reviewed. The global context is then considered. Croplands are estimated to be the largest biospheric source of carbon lost to the atmosphere in Europe each year, but the cropland estimate is the most uncertain among all land-use types. It is estimated that European croplands (for Europe as far east as the Urals) lose 300 Mt C per year. The mean figure for the European Union is estimated to be 78 (S.D. 37) Mt C per year. There is significant potential within Europe to decrease the flux of carbon to the atmosphere from cropland, and for cropland management to sequester soil carbon, relative to the amount of carbon stored in cropland soils at present. The biological potential for carbon storage in European (EU15) cropland is of the order of 90-120 Mt C per year with a range of options available including reduced and zero tillage, set-aside, perennial crops and deep rooting crops, more efficient use of organic amendments (animal manure, sewage sludge, cereal straw, compost), improved rotations, irrigation, bioenergy crops, extensification, organic farming, and conversion of arable land to grassland or woodland. The sequestration potential, considering only constraints on land-use, amounts of raw materials and available land, is up to 45 Mt C per year. The realistic potential and the conservative achievable potentials may be considerably lower than the biological potential due to socioeconomic and other constraints, with a realistically achievable potential estimated to be about 20% of the biological potential. As with other carbon sequestration options, potential impacts on non-CO2 trace gases need to be factored in. If carbon sequestration in croplands is to be used in helping to meet emission reduction targets for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the changes in soil carbon must be measurable and verifiable. Changes in soil carbon can be difficult to measure over a five-year commitment period and this has implications for Kyoto accounting and verification. Currently, most countries can hope to achieve only a low level of verifiability during the first commitment period, whilst those with the best-developed national carbon accounting systems will be able to deliver an intermediate level of verifiability. Very stringent definitions of verifiability would require verification that would be prohibitively expensive for any country. Carbon sequestration in soil has a finite potential and is non-permanent. Soil carbon sequestration is a riskier long-term strategy for climate mitigation than direct emission reduction and can play only a minor role in closing carbon emission gaps by 2100. However, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be stabilised at reasonable levels (450-650 ppm), drastic reductions in carbon emissions will be required over the next 20-30 years. Given this, carbon sequestration should form a central role in any portfolio of measures to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the next 20-30 years, whilst new energy technologies are developed and implemented. Given that improved agricultural management often has a range of other environmental and economic benefits in addition to climate mitigation potential, such "win-win" strategies to improve soil carbon storage are attractive and should be implemented as part of integrated sustainability policies.</abstract>

    <title>Environmental impact assessment of agricultural production systems using the life cycle assessment methodology. I. Theoretical concept of a LCA method tailored to crop production.</title>
    <abstract>A new life cycle assessment (LCA) method is presented, which is specifically tailored to plant nutrition in arable crop production. Generally, LCA is a methodology to assess all environmental impacts associated with a product or a process by accounting and evaluating its resource consumption and emissions. In LCA studies the entire production system should be considered, i.e. for crop production systems the analysis includes not only the on-field activities, but also all impacts related to the production of raw materials (minerals, fossil fuels) and farm inputs like fertilizers, plant protection substances, machinery or seeds. The LCA method developed in this study evaluates the impact of emissions and resource consumption associated with crop production on the following environmental effects: depletion of abiotic resources, land use, climate change, toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. In order to enable conclusions on the overall environmental impact of alternative crop nutrition systems, an aggregation procedure to calculate indicators for resource depletion (RDI) and environmental impacts (EcoX) has been developed. The higher the EcoX value, the higher is the overall environmental burden associated with the product under investigation. An environmental analysis of arable crop production systems based on this LCA method is especially appropriate in order to: (1) detect environmental hot spots in the system; (2) trace back environmental impacts of arable farming products to their sources and on that basis to suggest options for improvement; and (3) contribute to the debate on the environmental preference of alternative cropping systems in an informed way.</abstract>

    <title>Environmental impact assessment of agricultural production systems using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. II. The application to N fertilizer use in winter wheat production systems.</title>
    <abstract>This study examined the environmental impact of different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates in winter wheat production by using a new life cycle assessment (LCA) method, which was specifically tailored to crop production. The wheat production system studied was designed according to "good agricultural practice". Information on crop yield response to different N rates was taken from a long-term field trial in the UK (Broadbalk Experiment, Rothamsted). The analysis considered the entire system, which was required to produce 1 ton of wheat grain. It included the extraction of raw materials (e.g. fossil fuels, minerals), the production and transportation of farming inputs (e.g. fertilizers) and all agricultural operations in the field (e.g. tillage, harvest). In a first step, all emissions and the consumption of resources connected to the different processes were listed in a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and related to a common unit, which is 1 ton of grain. Next a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was done, in which the inventory data are aggregated into indicators for environmental effects, which included resource depletion, land use, climate change, toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. After normalization and weighting of the indicator values it was possible to calculate summarizing indicators for resource depletion and environmental impacts (EcoX). At N rates of 48, 96, 144 or 192 kg N/ha the environmental indicator "EcoX" showed similar values per ton of grain (0.16-0.22 EcoX/ton of grain). At N rates of zero, 240 and 288 kg N/ha the EcoX values were 100-232% higher compared with the lowest figure at an N rate of 96 kg N/ha. At very low N rates, 'land use' was the key- environmental-factor, whereas at high N rates 'eutrophication' was the major problem. The results revealed that agronomical optimal arable farming does not necessarily come into conflict with economic and environmental boundary conditions.</abstract>

    <title>Growth and yield responses of spring and winter triticale cultivated under Mediterranean conditions.</title>
    <abstract>Eight hexaploid triticale genotypes, five of spring and three of winter growth habit were used to study biomass production, contribution of the pre-anthesis assimilates to the grain yield, and their relationship to grain yield. Genetic effects for biomass production were found at anthesis but not at maturity. Growth-habit explained most of the detected differences for biomass production: winter triticale had around 15% higher dry matter than spring triticale at anthesis. However, the higher accumulated thermal time from sowing to anthesis could explain the observed differences, since the correlation coefficient between both variables was 0.78 (P < 0.001, n = 24). Dry matter translocation (DMT) was 30% higher for winter than for spring triticales, representing a contribution to the grain yield of 60.9% for winter genotypes and 42.0% for spring ones. However, grains were 26.8% heavier in spring than in winter triticales, and, finally, spring triticales yielded around 21% more than winter types. For spring genotypes, crop dry weight at anthesis was positively related to yield, whereas for winter triticales the relationship for these two variables was negative. Highest values of triticale grain yield were reached when time from sowing to anthesis was comprised, approximately, between 1350 and 1420 growing degree-days (GDD), decreasing before and after this interval. Thus, time to anthesis for spring triticales were included into the optimum interval, which permitted to reach higher grain yield. We could conclude that spring triticales are much more adapted than winter triticales for grain production under Mediterranean conditions.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of elevated CO2 and cutting frequency on the productivity and herbage quality of a semi-natural grassland.</title>
    <abstract>Monoliths of a fertile, although N limited, C3 grassland community were subjected (or not) to an atmospheric CO2 enrichment (600 micromol mol(-1)), owing to the Mini-FACE system from August 1998 to June 2001, at two contrasting cutting frequencies (3 and 6 cuts per year). The present study reports the effects of elevated CO2 on the above-ground productivity and on the herbage quality. Elevated CO2 did not affect the dry matter (DM) yield of the swards in 1999. In 2000, the second year, there was a positive CO2 effect (+26%) both on the DM and on the nitrogen yields (+30%). With the frequently cut monoliths, the DM of the legume component of the sward was strongly increased by elevated CO2. This effect became also significant in July 2000 for the low cutting frequency treatment. These results are in good agreement with the concept of an increased legume development and symbiotic N2 fixation triggered by an increased ecosystem scale demand of N under elevated CO2. At a low cutting frequency, the DM of the forbs was strongly increased in elevated compared with ambient CO2. This increased development of the forbs apparently led to a competitive decline of the grasses. Therefore, the total DM yield response to CO2 was smaller at a low (+15%) compared with a high (+36%) cutting frequency in 2000. An increase in the water soluble sugar content of the bulk forage under elevated CO2 and a corresponding decline in cell wall contents (NDF) were observed. In June 1999, the decline in NDF was correlated with an increased in-vitro DM digestibility. The forage quality was also indirectly affected by elevated CO2 through changes in leaf:stem ratio and in botanical composition. At a low cutting frequency, the increased forb content favoured the herbage quality because of a higher digestibility of the forb shoots and, indirectly, through the reduction in the mass of the grass stems. These results emphasise the role of species dynamics for elevated CO2 impacts on semi-natural grassland productivity and herbage quality.</abstract>

    <title>Factors affecting root and seed yield in ahipa (Pachyrhizus ahipa (Wedd.) Parodi), a multipurpose legume crop.</title>
    <abstract>Ahipa (Pachyrhizus ahipa) is a legume crop, which produces carbohydrate-rich tuberous roots and seeds rich in protein and oil. In the present work, we studied the effect of different agronomic practices and climatic conditions on root and seed yield in order to make a preliminary assessment of the yield potential under different managements for the ahipa crop in south-western Europe. Sowing date affected productivity when delayed, because of growth season shortening. Reproductive pruning greatly increased root yield. Increasing planting density affected root and fruit growth per plant but increased yield to a certain extent. Seed inoculation with effective rhizobia greatly increased root and seed production. Low temperature is a main factor to be considered as it reduced productivity in areas of cool nights. Ahipa has a low environmental impact and low input requirement (fertilizer, pesticides), providing an attractive alternative to traditional sources of carbohydrates for conserving non-renewable resources and maintaining farmer profitability. Competitive yields for the simultaneous production of starch, feed protein and industrial oil may be obtained with low investment using available landraces.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of lupins as compared with peas and oats on the yield of the subsequent winter barley crop.</title>
    <abstract>New high yielding early maturing cultivars of lupins have been introduced in north-west Europe as grain protein crops in crop rotations. This paper reports on a comparative study of lupins with peas and oats, and of their effect on yield of subsequent winter barley crops. These crops were given five levels of N under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions on sand and loam. Under rain fed conditions the grain yield of pea, oat and lupin varied between 24-36, 34-53 and 18-37 hkg DM ha(-1), respectively. Supplemental irrigation raised grain yield of oat to 50-60 hkg DM ha(-1), while grain yield in pea was not affected and grain yield in lupin in most cases decreased due to gray mould attack and excessive vegetative growth in the indeterminate lupin variety. Under rain fed conditions, the grain nitrogen content of pea, oat and lupin varied between 137-172, 61-80 and 189-226 kg N ha(-1), respectively, and was significantly higher in lupin as compared with pea. On sandy soil, similar low-root densities were found for pea, oat and lupin below 30 cm depth. On sand, at final harvest the residual soil-N of lupin and pea, as measured in a subsequent winter barley crop not supplied with N fertilizer, was 15 and 8-10 kg N ha(-1) higher than in winter barley following oat, respectively. The nature of the probably more N-root residues of lupin is discussed. On loam, the residual N of lupin and pea was similar, 18-27 kg N ha(-1). On sand, under rain fed conditions preceding lupin and pea as compared with oat, increased the barley grain yield at zero N-application 77 and 49%, respectively; the effect of lupin was significantly higher than that of pea until the highest N-level 120 kg N-application ha(-1). On loam under rain fed conditions preceding lupin and pea increased the barley grain yield at zero N-application by 36 and 62%, respectively, as compared with oat; at N-application >60 kg N ha(-1) the grain yield was similar after all three crops. For both soil types the same level of effect was found under irrigated conditions. Conclusions: Supplemental irrigation might result in lower grain yield in lupin due to gray mould attack and excessive growth if indeterminate lupin varieties are used. Grain nitrogen yield of lupin is significantly higher than that of pea. On sand, the effect of lupin on the subsequent winter barley grain yield is significantly higher than that of pea, probably due to greater N-root nitrogen residues. On loam, lupin and pea have similar effects on the subsequent winter barley crop.</abstract>

    <title>Bio-accumulation and distribution of heavy metals in fibre crops (flax, cotton and hemp).</title>
    <abstract>Flax, hemp and cotton, grown in industrially polluted region, were included in the present research. The experimental plots were situated at different distances (0.5 and 15 km) from the source of pollution-the Non-Ferrous-Metal Works (MFMW) near Plovdiv. We investigated the level of pollution and the way heavy metals enter the fibre crops, by taking soil and plant samples. The contents of heavy metals in plant materials (roots, stems, leaves, seeds, flowers) were determined after the method of the dry mineralization. The quantitative measurements were carried out with inductively-coupled plasma (ICP). A clearly distinguished species peculiarity exists in the accumulation of heavy metals in the vegetative and reproductive organs of flax, hemp and cotton. Flax is the crop that most strongly absorbs and accumulates heavy metals from the soil, followed by hemp and cotton. The distribution of the heavy metals along the plant axis of the studied crops seems to be selective, therefore their contents in flax and hemp are decreasing in the following order: roots > stems > leaves > seeds, while in cotton: leaves > seeds > roots > stems. A strongly exhibited tendency towards decrease of the contents of heavy metals in the fibre crops is observed as the distance from the NFMW increases. Flax and hemp are cultures, suitable for growing in industrially polluted regions-they remove considerable quantities of heavy metals from the soil with their root system and can be used as potential crops for cleaning the soil from heavy metals.</abstract>

    <title>Functional properties of extruded foam composites of starch acetate and corn cob fiber.</title>
    <abstract>With increasing concerns about environmental protection and garbage handling, natural renewable materials such as starch, cellulose and other natural fibers become more and more popular in packaging materials manufacturing. In this study, physical and mechanical properties of extruded foam composites, prepared from starch acetate and cellulose/corn cob, were evaluated. A split-plot experimental design was used to compare selected functional properties of foams produced from starch acetate blended with ground corncobs, compared to blending with cellulose, and with different ethanol contents. Extrusions were conducted in a twin-screw extruder with 160 degrees C barrel temperature and 225 rpm screw speed. Physical properties of extrudates were measured including radial expansion ratio, unit density, bulk density, and water absorption index. Mechanical properties including unit spring index, bulk spring index, and compression strength were measured. Scanning electron microscopy was used to compare the macromolecular structures of the two types of starch acetate blends. Blending with corncobs significantly hindered radial expansion of starch acetate foams, whereas cellulose did not affect expansion significantly. Higher compression strength was obtained with higher corncob content. Although ethanol penetration assisted in the formation of a starch acetate-fiber matrix, corncob blends produced inferior linkages and cell development in the foams than foams produced with cellulose blends.</abstract>

    <title>Analytical protocols for characterisation of sulphur-free lignin.</title>
    <abstract>Interlaboratory tests for chemical characterisation of sulphur-free lignins were performed by five laboratories to develop useful analytical protocols, which are lacking, and identify quality-related properties. Protocols have been established for reproducible determination of the chemical composition and functional groups, such as phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of alkaline lignins from annual fibre sources. The lignins studied, were precipitated from black liquors of alkaline pulping of annual fibre crops, flax, hemp and straw. The total (Klason and acid soluble) lignin contents of these lignins range between 83 and 97%. Contaminants may be present, such as sugar residues (<3.2%), ash (<5.2%), including Si (<0.9%), and relatively high amounts of nitrogen (<1.6%). Furthermore, the (oxidised) acid precipitated soda lignins were found to contain significantly less phenolic hydroxyl and more carboxyl groups than organosolv lignin (Alcell). A comparison of FTIR and wet chemical methods indicated that acetylation for determination of hydroxyl groups under the conditions used is incomplete, resulting in an unreliable total hydroxyl determination. Molecular weight analysis of the round robin lignins using HPSEC with different eluents gave incomparable results. Number average molecular weights of the lignins, as found by VPO, are relatively low (2-3 phenylpropane units). Compared with Alcell lignin, soda lignins from flax, hemp and straw have different compositions, functional groups and molecular weights, which confirms that different functional properties are related to the chemical structure.</abstract>

    <title>Latex quantification in homogenate and purified latex samples from various plant species using near infrared reflectance spectroscopy.</title>
    <abstract>Parthenium argentatum (guayule) is under commercial development as a source of hypoallergenic latex, which is suitable for the manufacture of latex medical devices safe for use by people suffering from Type I latex protein allergy. Improving agronomic practices, post-harvest shrub handling, and optimizing latex extraction and purification protocols during bioprocessing are hampered by the relatively cumbersome latex quantification methods currently employed. Current methods require several hours before analytical results can be obtained. The object of our study was to develop and test a near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic method for rapid quantification of latex in both wet and dried P. argentatum homogenate and purified latex samples. The procedure was tested on latex samples from Ficus elastica (Indian rubber tree), Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Hevea brasiliensis (Brazilian or para rubber tree) and Taraxacum kok-saghyz (Russian dandelion). P. argentatum latex could be accurately quantified, over a wide concentration range of 0 to 25 mg/ml. The correlations between the measured rubber content and the rubber content predicted by NIR were 0.96 and 0.91 for dry and wet samples, respectively. The presence of homogenate components unrelated to the latex fraction did not perturb the correlations obtained. Similar predictive models could be used to measure the rubber content in F. elastica, H. annuus, H. brasilensis and T. kok-saghyz.</abstract>

    <title>Classification trees versus multinomial models in the analysis of urban farming systems in Central Africa.</title>
    <abstract>This study was aimed at the identification of location and household characteristics influencing the choice of keeping livestock or practising crop production in a post-conflict region in Central Africa. Two thousand eight hundred randomly selected families from Brazzaville (Congo) were surveyed. From these, 6% are both keeping livestock and producing crops, 3% are keeping livestock only, 24% are producing crops only and 67% are not producing crops nor keeping livestock. From these four groups, respectively, 135, 84, 246 and 245 households were interviewed to collect further data on household and location characteristics. Non-parametric and parametric techniques were compared as tools to analyse the groups. In the non-parametric classification tree method CART following variables were identified as being important for the engagement in keeping livestock or urban agriculture: keeping livestock before 1997, practising agriculture before 1997, property size, locality, income, availability of water, professional activity and level of instruction. Including surrogate variables resulted in extra variables: age, availability of electricity and sex. In the multinomial regression only the most important variables from the classification tree were withheld and other insights were obtained. The results of this research highlighted the shortcomings of multinomial regression. Fitting a full model containing all possible interactions becomes an impossible task with 20 explanatory variables. Using the classification tree information in a multinomial model appears the most appropriate solution, and this method is a useful tool for further work in the analysis of livestock and crop production systems. The importance of the historical component in the decision to practise crop production and keep livestock was demonstrated. Being involved in crop production develops roots, which cannot be destroyed by impediments such as periods of conflict.</abstract>

    <title>Eucalyptus-wheat interaction on Ethiopian Nitosols.</title>
    <abstract>Over the past few years a single row of Eucalyptus globulus trees planted along the borders of cropland has come to dominate central highland agroforestry practices. Although evidence is scanty, there is a perception that this practice adversely affects crop productivity. An on-farm trial was therefore conducted at Ginchi to determine the biomass production potential of eucalypt boundaries and their effect on the productivity of the adjacent wheat crop (Triticum aestivum) on highland Nitosols. Three rotation cycles of 4 years each, two stand ages within each rotation, four field aspects and six yield strata perpendicular to the tree-crop interface were arranged in a split-split plot design with three replications. The annual wood production rate, which was 345-903 kg ha-1 yr-1 with two- and four-year-old stands in the first cycle, was increased more than 2-fold in the subsequent two rotation cycles. With these productivities, eucalypt boundaries on a hectare of land in the second and third cycle would satisfy about 70% of the annual biomass energy requirement of a rural household with a family size of five people for four consecutive years. However, adjacent wheat yields were substantially reduced because of the combined effects of water, light and nutrient competition. In the last two rotation cycles, significant yield depressions occurred over the first 16 m from the line of trees as opposed to only the first 8 m in the first cycle. The yield drop was 4.5-8.1%, and 8.1-10.4% in the first and last two rotation cycles, respectively. Nevertheless, the benefit accrued from the tree component adequately compensated for this reduction in wheat yield and generated additional income. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of the suitability of the practice in the region and its role in relieving the increasing pressure on indigenous forest and woodland.</abstract>

    <title>Dietary macro- and micronutrient intakes of nonsupplemented pre- and postmenopausal women with a perspective on menopause-associated diseases.</title>
    <abstract>Objectives: To assess the dietary intakes and diet quality of menopausal women relative to premenopausal women, and to determine whether their diets are compatible with reducing risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and osteoporosis. Design: Cross-sectional study using 3-day food records and anthropometric measurements. Subjects: Thirty apparently healthy, nonoestrogen using and nonsupplemented women menopausal since 3-5 years and 30 well-matched premenopausal women. Outcome measures: Nutrient intakes, diet nutrient density, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and serum oestradiol. Results: Energy intake and body weight of pre- and postmenopausal women were comparable. Their BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratios were within healthy ranges. The diet of postmenopausal women was compatible (less total lipids and saturated fatty acids; more fibres, antioxidant vitamins and potassium) with North American nutritional recommendations linked to cardiovascular health. Their dietary iron intakes exceeded their reduced physiological need, which may jeopardize their cardiovascular system. Their calcium and vitamin D intakes were far below recommendations for healthy bones. Five other nutrients were also suboptimal. Phosphorus intake (high in both groups) correlated with dietary proteins, sulphur amino acids and calcium. Conclusions: The diet of the postmenopausal women studied were more compatible with national nutritional recommendations than that of premenopausal controls. However, these postmenopausal women, not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and having inadequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intakes, may be at increased risk of osteoporotic fracture later in life. More studies on CVD risk inherent to body iron accumulation involving a large number of postmenopausal women are warranted before planning public health measures regarding dietary iron intake.</abstract>

    <title>Comparison of nutritional risk screening tools in patients on admission to hospital.</title>
    <abstract>Background and aims: Undernutrition has been frequently reported in patients on admission to hospital. Because this is not always detected promptly, screening for nutritional risk on admission has been widely advocated. Although there is no universally accepted 'gold standard' for defining undernutrition, the definition used by McWhirter, J.P. & Pennington, C.R. [(1994) Br. Med. J.308, 945] has been widely used by clinical nutrition specialists. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of two frequently used nutritional risk screening tools in detecting undernutrition according to this definition. Methods: Both the Nutrition Risk Index [Veterans Affairs Total Parenteral Nutrition Co-operative Study Group (1991) N. Engl. J. Med.325, 525] and the Nutrition Risk Score [Reilly H.M. et al. (1995) Clin. Nutr.14, 269] were used to screen for undernutrition in 359 admissions to two acute teaching hospitals in Dublin. Undernutrition was defined as a Body Mass Index below 20 kg m2 and a triceps skinfold thickness or mid-arm muscle circumference below the 15th percentile. Comparison of stratification of nutritional risk by the two screening tools was carried out. Results: Both screening tools identified over 40% (Nutrition Risk Index, 44%; Nutrition Risk Score, 46%) of all patients assessed as at nutritional risk on admission. However, one-third of the undernourished patients were classified as at no nutrition risk by the Nutrition Risk Index, while almost one-fifth of those undernourished were classified as at low risk by the Nutrition Risk Score. The degree of nutritional risk differed with the screening tool used, the Nutrition Risk Score classifying 29% of all patients as high risk while the Nutrition Risk Index classified only 5% as in the high risk category. Conclusions: Although a large proportion of patients on admission were classified as being at nutritional risk, the degree of risk was significantly different depending on the screening tool used. Both nutritional risk screening tools evaluated in this study failed to recognize many cases of undernutrition. Evaluation of the efficacy of nutritional screening tools should be promoted as seriously as the development of such tools.</abstract>

    <title>Changes in the activity and expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase, ACC oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in asparagus spears in response to wound-induced ethylene synthesis.</title>
    <abstract>The molecular and enzymatic changes that follow harvesting of asparagus are important aspects for postharvest deterioration. To define the factors contributing to postharvest deterioration, the early changes in ethylene production and the activities and expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase, ACC oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were studied in whole spears and in excised top and bottom portions. As a result of wounding, ethylene production was found higher in both top and bottom portions compared with whole spears but followed the same trend reaching the peak at 16 hours after harvest. ACC synthase was rapidly induced in excised top portions but no significant ACC synthase activity was observed in excised bottom portions. In top portions, ACC synthase reached a peak 8 hours after harvest and thereafter started to decline. In contrast to ACC synthase, ACC oxidase was induced markedly in both top and bottom portions and remained high until 16 hours after excision. On the other hand, PAL greatly increased in activity in bottom portions but not in excised tops. Northern blot analysis showed that increased mRNA levels coincided well with the excision-promoted increases in enzyme activity and ethylene production.</abstract>

    <title>Creeping bentgrass seedlings tolerance to herbicides and paclobutrazol.</title>
    <abstract>The tolerance of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) seedlings to many herbicides has not been evaluated. Three field studies were conducted between fall and spring from 1998 to 2002 to assess creeping bentgrass seedling tolerance to five herbicides and paclobutrazol. The primary objectives of this investigation were to assess bentgrass tolerance to these chemicals when applied at various timings following seedling emergence, and establishment of new seedlings as influenced by potential soil residues in the spring following a fall application of the chemicals. Treatments were applied 2, 4, or 7 weeks after either 'Crenshaw' or 'L-93' creeping bentgrass seedlings had emerged. Siduron (6.7 and 9.0 kg.ha(-1)) and bensulide (8.4 kg.ha(-1)) were noninjurious when applied two weeks after seedling emergence (2 WASE). Bensulide (14 kg.ha(-1)), ethofumesate (0.84 kg.ha(-1)), prodiamine (0.36 kg.ha(-1)) and paclobutrazol (0.14 kg.ha(-1)) were too injurious to apply 2 WASE, but they were generally safe to apply at 4 WASE. Chlorsulfuron (0.14 kg.ha(-1)) was extremely phytotoxic to seedlings when applied 2 WASE. Plots were treated with glyphosate and overseeded the following spring. The overwintering soil residuals of prodiamine and bensulide (14.0 kg.ha(-1)) unacceptably reduced spring establishment. All other herbicides and paclobutrazol had little or no adverse residual effects on spring establishment.</abstract>

    <title>Abscisic acid accumulation in relation to drought tolerance in Kentucky bluegrass.</title>
    <abstract>Drought is a major factor limiting plant growth, which has been associated with the accumulation of absicsic acid (ABA) in various species. The objective of the study was to determine the relationship between ABA accumulation and drought tolerance for kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) during short-term drought stress. Eight kentucky bluegrass cultivars ('Midnight', 'A82-204', 'RSP', 'Alpine', 'Moonlight', 'Brilliant', 'Washington', and 'Baruzo') were subjected to drought stress in a growth chamber. Water relations, gas exchange rate, and ABA content of leaves were determined at various times during drought stress. Turf quality decreased with drought duration for all eight cultivars. Leaf ABA content increased linearly with drought stress within 11 days of treatment; the rate of the increase was negatively related to the rate of turf quality decline. The rate of ABA accumulation during drought stress was positively correlated with the rates of decrease in turf quality (r2 = 0.6346), increase in electrolyte leakage (r2 = 0.7128), and decrease in relative water content (r2 = 0.5913). There were highly significant negative correlations between ABA content and leaf water potential (r2 = 0.9074), stomatal conductance (r2 = 0.6088), transpiration rate (r2 = 0.6581), net photosynthesis rate (r2 = 0.6956), and a positive correlation between ABA content and electrolyte leakage (r2 = 0.7287). The results indicate that drought tolerance is negatively related to ABA accumulation during short-term drought stress. ABA accumulation in response to drought stress could be used as a metabolic factor to select for drought tolerance in kentucky bluegrass.</abstract>

    <title>Intentional mis-reporting of food consumption and its relationship with body mass index and psychological scores in women.</title>
    <abstract>Background: The reasons for mis-reporting food consumption warrant investigation. Objective: To document intention to mis-report food consumption and its associations with psychological measures in women. Design: A total of 184 female volunteers aged 18-65 years, comprising 50 seeking help in primary care to lose weight with a body mass index (BMI) >or=30 kg m-2 (obese-clinical group) and 134 nurses (nonclinical groups) (BMI <25 kg m-2, n = 52; BMI 25-29.9 kg m-2, n = 45; BMI >or=30 kg m-2, n = 37) were studied. A questionnaire was administered containing three psychological tests (self-esteem, psychological well-being and Stunkard's three-factor eating questionnaire) and new items to address food intake mis-reporting. Results: Overall, 68% of participants declared an inclination to mis-report (64% nonclinical, 78% clinical). Inclination to under-report was 29, 33 and 51% in the three nonclinical groups; and 46% among the obese clinical patients. Among the same groups, inclination to over-report were 39, 29, 11 and 32%. After adjusting for social deprivation and BMI, women inclined to mis-report had higher hunger (P = 0.008) and disinhibition (P = 0.005) scores than those intending to report accurately. These variables were associated with current dieting, frequency of dieting, self-reported bingeing and dissatisfaction with body weight. Conclusions: These findings indicate that intentional under-reporting and over-reporting of food consumption are common in women of all BMI categories and are associated with eating behaviour. Current dieting, frequency of dieting in the past, self-reported bingeing and dissatisfaction with body weight seem to mediate this relationship.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of changing to a self-selected vegetarian diet on anthropometric measurements in UK adults.</title>
    <abstract>Background: Vegetarians are often a little leaner compared with nonvegetarians and suffer less from obesity and its associated complications than nonvegetarians. Whether this is because of not eating meat specifically is unclear. Objective: We investigated whether changing to a self-selected vegetarian diet resulted in changes to anthropometric measurements. Design: Subjects (n = 33; seven males and 26 females) who were in the earliest stages of becoming vegetarian were observed for 6 months. Data on dietary intake, using a 3-day estimated dietary diary, and body composition were obtained at baseline and after 6 months of following a self-selected vegetarian diet. Results: Dietary calculations showed that on changing to a self-selected vegetarian diet, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in energy intake (8.9 MJ day-1 versus 8.1 MJ day-1), and in the proportion of energy from saturated fatty acids (12.9% versus 11.3%) and a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the proportion of energy from carbohydrates (44.9% versus 47.5%) and in intake of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) (1.6 g MJ-1 versus 2.0 g MJ-1). Significant reductions in mid-upper arm circumference, calculated body fat, biceps and triceps skinfolds and waist and hip circumferences were observed. No reduction in body weight was observed. Conclusion: The findings of our study suggest that significant dietary changes, helping people to conform more closely to current dietary recommendations, occurred when people became vegetarian. In this study we did not find any significant change in body weight, but significant reductions were observed in skinfold thickness and waist : height ratio which imply that on changing to a self-selected vegetarian diet, the subjects became leaner.</abstract>

    <title>Biocidal plant dried pellets for biofumigation.</title>
    <abstract>The presence in all Brassicaceae plant organs of high amounts of glucosinolates, and of the enzyme myrosinase that catalyses their hydrolysis, linked to the high biocidal activity of some glucosinolate enzymatic hydrolysis derivative products (mainly isothiocyanates and nitriles) have suggested the practical possibility of amending soil with these natural biocidal compounds by the cultivation and green manure of selected species of this family. The application of this technique even at full field level has given, in recent years, interesting applicative results, with clear advantages for the following crop yield (e.g. strawberry), if compared with an untreated soil or a conventional green manure, evidencing that the glucosinolate-myrosinase system may provide a natural alternative for methyl bromide soil fumigation. In this paper, some preliminary results of a study on the possibility of drying some of these selections to produce biocidal pellets to be used as organic treatments in addition or in alternative to biocidal green manure are reported and discussed. The first target was to limit, during drying, glucosinolate leakage and myrosinase activity loss; in this way, in fact, dry plants should be able to produce in soil the biocidal compounds when watered by irrigation. Using a simple drying up lab technique, it was possible, for some selections, to lose <40% of starting glucosinolate and to preserve myrosinase activity at a sufficient level. These results could be further improved using industrial dehydration plant. The dried plants, after water addition, showed, in vitro, a good fungitoxic activity on Pythium ssp. and Rhizoctonia solani, confirming the results obtained in similar tests with pure glucosinolate and pure myrosinase. These results open interesting applicative perspectives for this new raw material probably even as a natural alternative to methyl bromide.</abstract>

    <abstract>The use of oil with a high level of erucic acid in some industrial sectors appears to offer excellent prospects from a technological and environmental point of view. This study was carried out to determine the potential of a new Eruca sativa spp. oleiformis selection named Nemat as a source of high erucic oil in the Po Valley environment. This species, classified as catch crop of the nematode Heterodera schachtii, showed a wide adaptability both in spring and autumn sowing and permitted a generally satisfactory productive yield over 3-year trials, with a grain yield ranging between 1.9 and 2.2 t ha(-1) (autumn sowing). Seeds presented an oil concentration around 290 g kg(-1) with significant higher amount in spring sowing, while fatty acid composition was characterised by a long chain content higher than 53%. The residual meal presented a high level of thiofunctionalised glucosinolates (GLs), showing some interesting perspectives in integrated pest management.</abstract>

    <title>Production process for high density high performance binderless boards from whole coconut husk.</title>
    <abstract>Coconuts are typically growing in coastal areas of tropical countries. The husk is abundantly available as cheap residue from coconut production in many areas, which is known to yield the coarse coir fibre. In this project a simple and efficient technology has been developed to produce high strength-high density board materials from whole coconut husks, without the addition of chemical binders. The board exhibits excellent properties, which are comparable with or even superior to commercial wood based panels. The pressed coconut husk boards can be handled with common wood working equipment for drilling and sawing, planing and polishing. Screwing, however, is only possible after pre-drilling and the board product is too hard for nailing.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of farmers' seed selection on genetic variation of a landrace population of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), grown in North-West Italy.</title>
    <abstract>Recognition by the European Community of élite landraces encourages farmers to grow these and earn more than is possible by growing modern varieties. However, farmers often exercise strong selection by collecting seed from a limited number of plants which best embody a few characters of prime interest. This, in the long run, may be responsible for considerable genetic erosion. In Southern Piedmont, North-West Italy, a local landrace of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) known as Cuneo is grown; it deserves particular attention because of its hardiness, late production and fruit quality. We used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to assess the effect, on genetic composition of a population, of seed sampling carried out using the selection criteria adopted by the farmer. After two reproductive cycles using selection, it was already possible to detect loss in genetic variation and a change in allele frequencies, while no significant effect was found after two cycles of random sampling. Over this period, farmer selection pressure led to disappearance of eight low-frequency alleles, while only three alleles were lost in randomly sampled populations. Our results stress the need to adopt appropriate techniques for seed sampling in order to avoid genetic erosion of local landrace gene pools.</abstract>

    <title>Analysis of genetic diversity in Turkish sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) populations using RAPD markers.</title>
    <abstract>The genetic diversity of 38 cultivated populations of Sesamum indicum L. from four different regions of Turkey was estimated at the DNA level with the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Sixty-one bands were obtained for all populations 78% of which were polymorphic. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used to investigate the genetic diversity of the populations which yielded highly significant differences among populations within regions (91.9% of the total genetic diversity). According to AMOVA and Shannon''s index that were performed separately for each region, the highest value of genetic variation was observed among Northwest region populations (CV = 7.7; H(0) = 0.304) and lowest in the Southeast regions'' populations (CV = 2.6; H(0) = 0.068). Nei and Li''s similarity index was calculated and phylogenetic tree was established using the neighbor-joining algorithm. This phenetic analysis grouped 35 of 38 accessions in six groups leaving three highly diverse accessions outside. Wagner phylogenetic method was used to assess the phylogenetic relationships among the populations. In the majority-rule consensus tree, only 7 of the 32 forks showed above 60% occurrence. Using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) of the RAPD data set, the groups were clearly separated along the first three axis. These results indicate that RAPD technique is useful for sesame systematics, and should be valuable for the maintenance of germplasm banks and the efficient choice of parents in breeding programs.</abstract>

    <title>Evaluation of Aegilops tuaschii Coss. for resistance to wheat stem rust and inheritance of resistance genes in hexaploid wheat.</title>
    <abstract>With the objective to identify new sources of resistance to wheat stem rust, a collection of 169 accessions ofAegilops tauschii, obtained from the IPK genebank at Gatersleben, Germany, were screened for resistance undercontrolled conditions. Fourteen (8%) accessions were resistant to stem rust among which 10 were highly resistant(IT 5 ; and 1) and four exhibited a moderately resistance reaction (IT 5 2). From the synthetic hexaploids whichwere produced by hybridizing resistant Ae. tauschii with susceptible Triticum durum, six synthetics expressed ahigh level of stem rust resistance similar to their corresponding diploid parents, while five displayed either areduced or complete susceptibility compared to their Ae. tauschii parents. This suppression of resistance at thehexaploid level suggests the presence of suppressor genes in the A and/ or B genomes of the T. durum parents.Inheritance of resistance from crosses of five stem rust resistant synthetic hexaploids with two susceptible T.aestivum genotypes revealed that three of the synthetics (syn 101, syn 601 and syn 801) possessed one dominantgene each, syn 111 has two different dominant genes and syn 116 has two complementary interacting genes forstem rust resistance. Intercrosses among the four stem rust resistant synthetic hexaploids indicated that the putativegenes conferring stem rust resistance in each of the synthetics are neither allelic nor closely linked to each other.</abstract>

    <title>Assessment of diversity using agro-morphological traits for selecting a core sampsle of Papua New Guinea taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott) collection.</title>
    <abstract>Agro-morphological variation in the taro germplasm of Papua New Guinea was estimated using 18 polymorphicdescriptor states to aid in the selection of a core sample for the formation of a regional core collection currentlybeing assembled under the Taro Network for Southeast Asia and Oceania. A total of 276 accessions were strati-fied into five homogenous groups by using a hierarchical approach according to botanical variety (dasheen oreddoe), altitude (high or low) and stolon formation (present or absent). In selecting the core sample, the eddoegroup were directly included because of their rarity in the germplasm collection. While, a ten per cent samplefraction within each group of the dasheen types were selected based on principal component scores. A total of 31accessions were selected for the core sample. Multivariate analysis of the core sample revealed wide variation,which was mainly influenced by botanical variety, plant height, lamina colour and variegation, petiole colour,corm shape, corm weight and palatability. Cluster analysis identified two homogeneous clusters based on predominantcharacters that should be useful to breeders. The results obtained in this study provide useful backgroundinformation for further development of a national core collection.</abstract>

    <title>Genetic diversity and intra-specific phylogeny of Triticum turgidum L. subsp. dicoccon (Schrank) Thell. revealed by RFLPs and SSRs.</title>
    <abstract>Today, emmer wheat, T. turgidum subsp. dicoccon, widely grown in the past is a candidate crop for sustainable agriculture in Italy. As part of a research project aimed at the enhanced use of the hulled wheat germplasm, molecular characterization was carried out to understand the genetic structure of the crop and to identify accessions of interest. A collection of 194 accessions was analyzed with 15 microsatellite loci (SSRs), while only a sample of 38 accessions was tested with 19 RFLP probes. The marker loci were selected on the basis of their independent genomic distribution. Genetic distances and allelic frequencies were calculated for each marker class. The genetic relationships were visualized with dendrograms. RFLP loci were, on average, less polymorphic than SSRs. An average Dice's genetic distance of 0.22 for RFLPs vs 0.38 for SSRs was detected, while an expected average heterozygosity per locus of 0.23 for RFLPs vs 0.26 for SSRs was also estimated. With a least number of 10 loci per marker class it was possible to identify each genotype. The most diverse accessions had different geographic origins. Germplasms from Italy and Ethiopia appear to belong to a more primitive genepool, given that a group of accessions from these countries were genetically differentiated from a Russian-Iranian group.</abstract>

    <title>Cooperatives in rural community development: A new framework for analysis.</title>
    <abstract>Although cooperatives are viewed as an important vehicle for community development, the relationship between cooperatives and communities is a neglected research issue. Because of this neglect, no framework for analysis of the relationship between cooperatives and communities exists. We present case studies of non-agricultural cooperatives in rural areas that provide some general insights into the innovative activities of successful cooperatives in rural community development. The case studies help define a new framework for analyzing the complete impact and efforts of cooperatives as community development agents. In contrast to the typical unifunctional and multifunctional categorization of cooperatives, our framework identifies two main categories of cooperative community development activities: unintentional, by simply organizing a business as a cooperative, and intentional, by creating community development programs. Cooperatives in this latter group are further sub-divided according to how closely the development activity is related to their core function.</abstract>

    <title>Amenities, natural resources, economic restructuring, and socioeconomic outcomes in nonmetropolitan America.</title>
    <abstract>This article explores the changing role of natural resources in community development in the United States. At one time, nonmetropolitan communities were dependent on traditional natural resources such as forests, minerals, and the soil, water, and climate necessary for agriculture. Where those resources were more abundant, populations were greater and life could be lived more abundantly. Amenity resources mattered little. It is apparent that circumstances have changed significantly. Data analyzed in this article explored the extent to which the presence or absence of amenity versus traditional natural resources influenced community development in recent years. A model was developed and tested to guide the analysis. It was found that from 1980 to 2000, communities with extensive amenity resources had a much greater increase in service employment. As a consequence of increased service sector employment, amenity rich counties had more extensive population growth. At the same time, high amenity communities also experienced a lower proportion of both adult males and females who are employed, an increased proportion of female-headed households, and higher poverty rates. These findings have significant implications for community leaders and community development specialists, which are discussed in this article.</abstract>

    <title>Building community through communication: The case for civic communion.</title>
    <abstract>This essay makes the argument for the centrality of communication in studying and developing community. Following a discussion of general theoretical arguments affirming and advancing the case for communication's connection to community building, the essay moves to an examination of a specific type of community, communicative event: "civic communion." Civic communions are communicative and performative community events that function to draw people into a shared identity, shared visions of community, and codes of conduct. Civic communions are episodes of community interaction that function as rhetorical and performative civic sacraments bonding citizenry around the social and political structures of a specific locale. These powerful community moments offer community development practitions a pragmatic and scholarly vehicle to assist and study the construction and maintenance of community.</abstract>

    <title>Community attachment, satisfaction, and action.</title>
    <abstract>The effects of community attachment and satisfaction on community-level action were examined using data collected in a general population survey from a random sample of individuals in two rural communities in Texas. Substantial support was found for the hypothesis that attachment to the community is associated positively with community action. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses reveal that higher levels of community attachment result in increased levels of community action. Virtually no support, though, was found for the hypothesis that community satisfaction is negatively associated with community action. The multivariate findings also suggest that certain sociodemographic variables (i.e., education, martial status, race, and length of residence) are important predictors of community action. Possible implications of the findings are advanced, as are suggestions for future research.</abstract>

    <title>Sustainable community development: A social approach from Vietnam.</title>
    <abstract>Sustainable development has emerged over the past few decades as an important paradigm for community development. In searching for ways to achieve a balance among the social, economic, and ecological health of communities, Western scholars and practitioners concerned with sustainable development have generally given priority to environmentally-oriented frameworks. However, in places with different cultural and political characteristics and material conditions compared to the industrialized West, a human-oriented, social approach to sustainable development can be observed. This article describes and analyzes how sustainable development is being approached using a non-Western, non-environmentally-oriented approach. We present a case study of a mangrove management program in Southern Vietnam to illustrate such a social approach to sustainability--through collaborative efforts among government, quasi-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and local communities. We emphasize the role of women in development efforts.</abstract>

    <title>Airblast application of copper fungicide to grapefruit does not affect windscar.</title>
    <abstract>Wind-induced blemishing known as windscar and lesions from the disease melanose (caused by Diaporthe citri) are two of the most important causes of fresh grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) cullage in Florida. Copper hydroxide fungicides are the primary means of controlling melanose, but high air velocities from passing sprayers have been suspected of increasing windscar. In 1998 and 1999, airblast applications of Cu(OH)2 (1.7 kg.ha(-1) Cu) were made at a range of early fruit development stages to a fresh grapefruit orchard in the Indian River region of Florida. These applications supplemented aerial sprays of Cu(OH)2 that were made uniformly across the entire experimental site at biweekly intervals beginning near full bloom. During the commercial harvest period fruit were sampled from three regions (interior, upper exterior, and lower exterior) of each treatment tree and were evaluated for percentage of fruit surface covered by windscar and severity of melanose. Airblast applications did not affect windscar in either year, but windscar was significantly greater from the upper exterior of the canopy, which is likely to experience the highest natural wind velocities. From these data, it appears unlikely that airblast applications significantly contribute to windscar of Indian River grapefruit. In 1998, no trees receiving airblast applications had significantly lower melanose incidence than the trees sprayed only via aircraft; however, trees receiving four airblast applications were scored as having higher apparent melanose on exterior samples than trees receiving most other treatments. This is consistent with high levels of Cu injury on these fruit which can superficially resemble melanose. Following treatment in 1999, trees receiving four airblast applications of Cu(OH)2 had significantly lower melanose scores than trees receiving either no or only early airblast applications, but were not significantly different from trees receiving a single spray 5.5 weeks postbloom. A computer model, which estimates Cu levels on fruit based on fruit growth, rainfall, and application parameters, indicated exterior fruit receiving four airblast sprays had >3 microgram.cm(-2) Cu for 40 days in 1998 but only 10 days in 1999, which reflects increased probability of Cu damage in 1998. It appears that aerial application supplemented by airblast merits further study as an economical means of melanose control.</abstract>

    <title>Both traditional and semi-bush tropical pumpkin can be intercropped with beans or cowpeas.</title>
    <abstract>Most cultivars of tropical pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata Duchesne) are large, trailing plants. New semi-bush (SB) genotypes need to be tested against traditional long vine (LV) types. Both types of pumpkin have large amounts of interplant space during the early stages of growth that might allow for the planting of an intercrop. To test this hypothesis, as well as the performance of tropical pumpkins of varying growth habit, double rows of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) or cowpeas Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. were intercropped between rows of SB or traditional LV tropical pumpkin in Spring and Fall 1993 in Lajas and Isabela, Puerto Rico. In general, interactions between intercrop treatment and pumpkin genotype were not significant. At its maximum percentage cover (MC) the LV genotype covered, or nearly covered, the entire plot while the SB genotype covered 50% of the plot or less. The SB pumpkin was harvested 5 to 27 days earlier than the LV type. Yield was two to 12 times greater, and average fruit size three to six times greater in the latter. Planting of an intercrop did not reduce pumpkin yield. Green-shelled yields of intercropped legumes averaged approximately equal to 700 kg.ha(-1). Genotype of the pumpkin maincrop did not affect legume green-shelled yields in Lajas. In Isabela, legume green-shelled yields were 50% higher in SB than in LV pumpkin plots. Legume dry grain yields were greatly reduced in LV compared to SB plots. Intercropping of tropical pumpkin with a short season legume that can be harvested green-shelled is an efficient intercropping system that offers additional yield from the legume without sacrificing yield from the pumpkin maincrop. Both SB and LV pumpkins can be used in an intercrop system, but pumpkin yields were much greater with the LV genotype.</abstract>

    <title>The anaerobic compensation point for fresh-cut watermelon and implications for postprocess handling.</title>
    <abstract>The influence of temperature and O2 concentration on respiration and shelf life of fresh-cut watermelon was investigated. Product stored at selected temperatures from 1 to 30 degrees C showed increasing respiration and reduced shelf life with increasing temperature. Oxygen depletion and CO2 evolution were measured using a closed system method and rates of O2 consumption and CO2 production were computed. A mathematical model found to predict the CO2 production as function of temperature and O2 showed an elevated rate of CO2 production at about 14% O2 or lower. A modified atmosphere trial that compared product stored at 7 to 9 degrees C in air with product at either 14% or 8% O2 revealed increased respiration in the latter treatments, suggesting a relatively high anaerobic compensation point (ACP) at >14% O2. Our results suggest limited applicability of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) for this product. Fresh-cut watermelon had extended shelf life and reduced respiration rate when stored at 1 to 3 degrees C and in >14% O2 atmospheres.</abstract>

    <title>Ice storm impact and management implications for jack pine and pitch pine stands in New York, USA.</title>
    <abstract>In January 1998, an ice storm caused severe damage to the rare jack pine - pitch pine barrens in northeastern New York. We quantified tree damage and recovery in seven barrens stands and an adjacent red pine stand. Ice storm damage was variable among stands with 44% to 94% of trees exhibiting damage. Live tree basal area (BA) was reduced by 9% to 45% in six of the eight stands, and dead tree BA increased in all stands. In mixed jack pine - pitch pine stands, the percent of jack pines dead after the ice storm (71% to 91%) was much higher than red maple (0% to 7%) or pitch pine (17% to 25%). Mortality of pitch pine was very low due largely to its ability to produce epicormic growth. Red pine exhibited more severe damage than eastern white pine. Because pine regeneration remains absent or sparse in the barrens stands, deciduous trees and ericaceous shrubs may eventually replace pine species. Mortality due to ice damage may exacerbate this problem in the absence of some regenerating disturbance, such as fire or harvesting.</abstract>

    <title>ADDITION OF SORBITOL WITH KMnO₄ IMPROVES BROCCOLI QUALITY RETENTION IN MODIFIED ATMOSPHERE PACKAGES.</title>
    <abstract>The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of sorbitol (a water absorbent) to packages containing potassium permanganate (KMnO[subscript 4]) on an inert carrier (a volatile adsorber) could be used to enhance the removal of volatiles associated with off-odors in broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., Italica group) during storage in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). Broccoli heads were held in PD-961EZ bags (five per bag), to allow CO[subscript 2] to accumulate above the recommended 5-10%. Six treatments within MAP were investigated: (1) control [-] 0-g sorbitol [+] 0 g-KMnO[subscript 4]; (2) 0-g sorbitol [+] 20.0-g KMnO[subscript 4]; (3) 2.5-g sorbitol [+] 20.0-g KMnO[subscript 4]; (4) 5.0-g sorbitol [+] 20.0-g KMnO[subscript 4]; (5) 10.0-g sorbitol [+] 20.0-g KMnO[subscript 4]; and (6) 20.0-g sorbitol [+] 20.0-g KMnO[subscript 4]. Broccoli heads in MAP with sorbitol had better appearance, firmness and odor ratings after 29 days of storage at 0-1C, compared to the controls. Furthermore, the odor rating was higher (less off-odor) as the amount of sorbitol was increased (1.9 control versus 3.9 for 20-g sorbitol). Slight increases in weight loss (</=1.3%) of the broccoli were also noted with the addition of sorbitol, although not near an amount that would affect marketability. Acetaldehyde concentrations were higher in the control bags with no sorbitol or KMnO[subscript 4] after 29 days of storage at 0-1C (0.21 versus 0.00-0.02 [mu]L[solidus]L with KMnO[subscript 4] and[solidus]or sorbitol), while ethanol content was greater in both control bags and those with only KMnO[subscript 4] (0.12-0.13 versus 0.00-0.06 [mu]L[solidus]L with sorbitol). Chlorophyll fluorescence ([Phi][subscript PSII]) began to decrease more rapidly in the control broccoli, as the ethanol and acetaldehyde began to accumulate. Overall, the use of sorbitol ([>/=]2.5 g) with KMnO[subscript 4] in MAP could enhance the removal of volatiles that are responsible for off-odors and off-flavors in broccoli, and thus maintain the quality and marketability longer.</abstract>

    <title>A comparison of three land-based containment systems for use in culturing green sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Müller) (Echinodermata: Echinoidea).</title>
    <abstract>Worldwide, most sea-urchin populations are in decline. Future market demands will likely be met through aquaculture, which may consist of gonad enhancement of wild-caught sea urchins. In this context, we examined three land-based containment systems for suitability in maintaining commercial-size green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis). Mortality rate, gonad quantity, gonad quality (colour, brightness, firmness, texture) and cleaning efficiency associated with each containment system were the criteria for comparing the effectiveness of the systems (large raceways, small raceways and washtub tanks). After 6 weeks, urchins maintained in large raceways displayed significantly higher mortality rates than urchins maintained in either the small raceways or washtub tanks (mean±SD: 24.3±10.4%, 8.0±3.5% and 4.3±1.5% respectively). Significant differences in cleaning time were detected among the three systems with washtub tanks requiring significantly more cleaning time (0.11±0.02 min urchin[superscript [-]1]) than the other two systems and large raceways requiring significantly less cleaning time (0.06±0.02 min urchin[superscript [-]1]) than the other two systems. No significant differences in gonad characteristics were detected among the three containment systems. Because of the higher mortality rate in the large raceways and the increased cleaning time required for the washtub tanks, the small raceways were considered to be the best of the three systems tested.</abstract>

    <title>Characterization of cellulase-producing bacteria from the digestive tract of tilapia, Oreochromis mossambica (Peters) and grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes).</title>
    <abstract>Isolation and characterization of cellulase-producing aeorobic bacterial flora in the intestine of omnivorous tilapia (Oreochromis mossambica) and phytophagous Chinese grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) have been carried out using selective carboxymethylcellulose-agar (CMC-agar) medium. The cellulolytic activity was measured both qualitatively and quantitatively. It was found that the ability of different strains in degrading cellulose varies within a wide range. Among the strains isolated from the gut of each test fish, TM1 and CI3 isolated from O. mossambica and C. idella, respectively exhibited maximum cellulolytic activity (67.02 and 35.8 U mL[superscript [-]1] respectively). Pure cultures of these strains were selected for morphological, physiological and biochemical characterization. On the basis of these tests, the isolated strains were identified as Bacillus circulans (TM1) and Bacillus megaterium (CI3). Both the strains are rod-shaped, motile and show better temperature (15-42°C) and pH (5-11) tolerance. The selected strains were further quantitatively assayed for amylase and protease activities. Maximum amylase and protease activities were exhibited by TM1 and CI3 respectively. Information generated from the present study might contribute towards better-feed formulation incorporating plant ingredients.</abstract>

    <title>Comparison of food selection and growth performance of koi carp, Cyprinus carpio L., and goldfish, Carassius auratus (L.) in mono- and polyculture rearing in tropical ponds.</title>
    <abstract>To compare the effect of polyculture against conventional monoculture on ornamental carp production, investigations on food selection and growth performance of koi carp (K), Cyprinus carpio L. and goldfish (G), Carassius auratus (L.) were conducted in a 11-week rearing experiment in two monoculture (100% K and 100% G) and five polyculture (90% K-10% G, 70% K-30% G, 50% K-50% G, 30% K-70% G and 10% K-90% G) conditions in tropical ponds. There were three replicates for each treatment. Environmental conditions and food availability were similar in all the treatments. Ivlev's electivity index showed that both fish species avoided phytoplankton and preferred cladocerans to other zooplankton groups (copepods and rotifers) in monotypic conditions. However, in the polyculture treatments, the positive electivity of goldfish towards cladocerans reduced significantly (P<0.05), while the percentage of copepods, rotifers and phytoplankton in the gut content increased. No significant differences in weight gain, specific growth rate and deformities were recorded at harvest for koi carp between the different treatments (P>0.05). Even the survival rate of koi carp recorded above 90% in all the treatments. However, the goldfish recorded significantly better weight gain, specific growth rate and survival in monoculture (100% G), compared with the polyculture treatments (P<0.05). Goldfish deformities were lowest (P<0.05) in the monoculture treatment (2.42%). The number of marketable fish above a set size limit of 4 g total weight was significantly higher in the two monoculture treatments, compared with the five polyculture treatments (P<0.05). Keeping in view of the dietary similarities of koi carp and goldfish, and the aggressive nature of koi carp in polyculture, it is suggested to refrain from polyculture of goldfish and koi carp until further documentations relating to optimum stocking density and management of polyculture of ornamental carps are available.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of water table depth on emissions of N₂O from a grassland soil.</title>
    <abstract>Nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions were measured by the closed chamber technique from five plots along a transect in a nitrogen-fertilised grassland, together with soil water content, soil temperature and water table depth, to investigate the effect of water table depth on N₂O emissions. N₂O fluxes varied from <1 g N₂O-N ha[superscript [-]1] day[superscript [-]1] to peaks of around 500-1200 g N₂O-N ha[superscript [-]1] day[superscript [-]1] after N fertiliser applications. There was no significant difference in overall average water table depth between four of the five plots, but significant short-term temporal variations in water table depth did occur. Rises in the water table were accompanied by exponential increases in N₂O emissions, through the associated increases in the water-filled pore space of the topsoil. Modelling predicted that if the water table could be managed such that it was kept to no less than 35 cm below the ground surface, fluxes during the growing season would be reduced by 50%, while lowering to 45 cm would reduce them by over 80%. The strong implication of these results is that draining grasslands, so that the water tables are only rarely nearer to the surface than 35 cm when N is available for denitrification, would substantially reduce N₂O emissions.</abstract>

    <title>Breastfeeding by Aboriginal mothers in Perth.</title>
    <abstract>To document the breastfeeding practices of Aboriginal mothers delivering in Perth. A cohort of mothers was followed from the time of delivery for six months to obtain details of infant feeding practices. A total of 455 mothers delivered during the study period and were asked to participate. A total of 425 mothers completed the initial questionnaire. The study was undertaken in six public hospitals in Perth, Western Australia. The data were analysed using spss. Breastfeeding duration was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Breastfeeding initiation and duration. The mean age of the Aboriginal mothers was 21.8 years (range 14-39 years, SD 5.32) and the average gestational age was 38.3 weeks. Almost 50% of the mothers in the study delivered by Caesarean section. At discharge from hospital 89.4% (CI 86.6-92.1) of mothers were breastfeeding, declining to 58.8% (CI 53.5-64.1) at six months. When compared with non-Aboriginal mothers, the Aboriginal breastfeeding rates were higher than the non-Aboriginal average breastfeeding rates, but lower than the highest socioeconomic group. The breastfeeding rates of Aboriginal mothers are higher than for other Australians. This is despite the low maternal age and level of education and the high rates of low-birth-weight infants and Caesarean section among this population. The World Health Organization recommendation for infant feeding is exclusive breastfeeding until six months, but less than one-third of Aboriginal mothers achieved this recommendation.</abstract>

    <abstract>The present study was designed to determine the individual and combined effects of acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) and trisodium phosphate (TSP) antimicrobial treatments. Chicken-skin samples inoculated with Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus were separately dipped into sterile tap water, 10% TSP, 0.1% ASC, 0.1% ASC followed by 10% TSP and 10% TSP followed by 0.1% ASC for 15 s at 25C ± 1. On day 0, reductions were 1.4-1.6 log for S. Typhimurium and 1.1-2.1 log for S. aureus, while they were 1.8-2.9 and 0.7-1.7 log, respectively, on day 5 of storage. Results indicated that treatment with ASC solution alone was more effective than treatment with ASC and TSP solutions combined in reducing S. aureus populations on chicken skin during the entire storage period. Similarly, treatment with TSP solution alone was more effective than treatment with ASC and TSP solutions combined in reducing S. typhimurium populations on chicken skin on days 1, 3 and 5 of storage.</abstract>

    <abstract>Hybrid walleye is important for recreational fisheries and is a potential aquaculture species in the north central region of the United States. Stress related to intensive culture conditions has been documented to cause eye lesions in fish. Finfish eyes do not have eyelids, hence the cornea is permanently exposed to mechanical damage and toxic substances. We documented various disorders of the eye in juvenile hybrid walleyes reared in a flow-through tank system. Abnormalities include exophthalmia, enophthalmia, unilateral loss of globe and bilateral loss of globe. These lesions negatively affected body weight, specific growth rate and condition factor of hybrid walleyes reared in tanks.</abstract>

    <title>Dietary levamisole modulates the immune response and disease resistance of Asian catfish Clarias batrachus (Linnaeus).</title>
    <abstract>In order to determine the immunomodulatory effect of dietary levamisole in Asian catfish (Clarias batrachus), fish were fed four different diets for 10 days: a formulated diet as control and the same diet supplemented with 50, 150 or 450 mg levamisole kg[superscript [-]1] feed. The serum bacterial agglutination titre against Aeromonas hydrophila as a measure of specific immunity, serum haemagglutination titre, natural haemolytic complement activity (ACH₅₀), myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities, total protein level and oxidative radical production by neutrophils as a measure of non-specific immunity as well as disease resistance against A. hydrophila challenge to separate vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups were evaluated at 0, 1, 2 and 3 weeks after last administration of levamisole. Levamisole supplement at the lowest level (50 mg kg[superscript [-]1]) significantly enhanced oxidative radical production and serum myeloperoxidase (MPO) content immediately after 10 days of feeding, which reached peak values after 3 and 2 weeks of feeding respectively. Haemolytic complement and haemagglutination titre were significantly enhanced after 3 and 1 weeks respectively. Haemolytic complement activity and MPO activities were significantly raised to 150 mg kg[superscript [-]1] after 3 and 2 weeks, respectively. At the highest level of levamisole feeding (450 mg kg[superscript [-]1]) significant decreases in superoxide production and complement activity were measured immediately after levamisole feeding, which returned to the normal level after 1 week post- feeding. Fish were challenged with a virulent strain of A. hydrophila at 0, 1, 2 and 3 weeks after levamisole feeding, and the cumulative per cent survival was recorded over 10 days. Feeding levamisole at 50, 150 or 450 mg kg[superscript [-]1] increased per cent survival in vaccinated fish immediately after levamisole feeding, and survival was significantly higher at 450 mg kg[superscript [-]1]. There was no difference in mortality patterns in non-vaccinated fish. The results support the use of levamisole at 50 mg kg[superscript [-]1] feed for 10 days as an immunostimulant in Asian catfish farming.</abstract>

    <title>Sustainable agricultural intensification in forest frontier areas.</title>
    <abstract>The Lore Lindu region in Indonesia--as in many forest frontier areas in Southeast Asia--has experienced rapid deforestation due to agricultural expansion in the uplands, at the forest margins. This has resulted in aggravated problems of erosion and water availability, threatening agricultural productivity growth. At the same time, technical progress is promoting agricultural intensification in the lowlands. In this article, we examine how improved technologies for paddy rice cultivation in the lowlands have affected agricultural expansion and deforestation in the uplands. The question of a "forest-saving" or "forest-clearing" effect related to technical innovation is important from a sustainable development perspective and remains a controversial issue in the literature. We address this question for the Lore Lindu region with an empirical model in which expansion in the lowlands and the uplands is estimated simultaneously. We use data from an extensive village survey conducted in the region, combined with GIS data. To guide the empirical analysis, we develop a theoretical framework based on a Chayanov-type agricultural household model. The model analyzes farmers' land allocation decisions, taking into account the lowland-upland dichotomy in the agricultural sector. The empirical findings, corroborated by the analytically derived results, show how technical progress for lowland production affects land use at the forest margins and how these effects depend on the factor-intensity of the technology. The findings imply specific rural development policies for sustainable agricultural intensification in forest frontier areas.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of dietary echium oil on growth, fatty acid composition and metabolism, gill prostaglandin production and macrophage activity in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.).</title>
    <abstract>Echium oil (EO) is a vegetable oil in which percentages of stearidonic acid (STA, 18:4n-3) often exceed those of its n-6 series equivalent [gamma]-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3n-6). Stearidonic acid is elongated to 20:4n-3 in fish cell cultures, suggesting that EO could be included in diets for marine fish to increase tissue 20:4n-3 and 20:3n-6 and, thereby, modulate eicosanoid metabolism. Thus, the present study aimed to test the hypotheses that dietary EO would increase tissue 20:4n-3 and 20:3n-6 and modulate immune function and eicosanoid production in juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) fed a diet where fish oil (FO) was replaced by EO. Duplicate groups of juvenile cod (initial weight ca. 4 g) were fed for 18 weeks on fish meal-based diets (55% protein and 16% lipid) that differed in oil source (FO or EO). There were no significant differences in growth and feed efficiency, hepato-somatic index, percentages of liver and flesh lipids and lipid class compositions for cod fed FO and EO. Percentages of 18:4n-3, 18:3n-6 and 20:3n-6 in the total lipids of flesh and liver were higher, and percentages of 20:5n-3 and 20:4n-6 were both lower in fish fed EO than in those given FO. In flesh, the increased 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 were primarily located in phosphatidylcholine and, to a lesser extent, phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas 20:3n-6 concentration was highest in phosphatidylinositol. Desaturation of 18:3n-3 (to tetraene products) and 20:5n-3 to 22:6n-3 in hepatocytes was very low but was increased by dietary EO. Echium oil significantly decreased the production of prostaglandin F from gill cells stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, and reduced head kidney macrophage activity, but had no effect on serum lysozyme activity or basic haematology. In conclusion, dietary EO may have beneficial effects on some immune parameters including eicosanoid metabolism in marine fish although this may be primarily because of decreased 20:4n-6 rather than increasing tissue levels of 20:3n-6 or 20:4n-3.</abstract>

    <title>Combined effects of water exchange regimes and calcium carbonate additions on growth and survival of hatchery-reared juvenile spotted babylon (Babylonia areolata Link 1807) in recirculating grow-out system.</title>
    <abstract>To determine a suitable culture environment to maximize growth and survival, the hatchery-reared juvenile spotted babylon, Babylonia areolata, were held in plastic rearing tanks at four calcium carbonate additions of 0, 100 and 300 g tonne[superscript [-]1], and four water exchange regimes of 0-, 15-, 30- and 60-day intervals in a recirculating grow-out system for 120 days. The results clearly showed that growth was greatest between water exchange regimes of 15- and 30-day intervals and all calcium carbonate additions, with water exchange regimes of 0- and 60-day intervals resulting in poor growth. Final survival was highest between water exchange regimes of 15- and 30-day intervals, and all calcium carbonate additions, with water exchange regimes of 0-day intervals and all calcium carbonate additions resulting in high mortalities. This study showed that water exchange regimes had a stronger influence on the growth of juvenile B. areolata than calcium carbonate additions. It is recommended that B. areolata juveniles be maintained within the water exchange regimes range of 15-30-day intervals and at calcium carbonate additions between 0 and 500 g tonne[superscript [-]1], providing optimum conditions for production of this species in a recirculating grow-out system.</abstract>

    <title>The Response of Playa and Sabkha Hydraulics and Mineralogy to Climate Forcing.</title>
    <abstract>Dry playa lakes and sabkhat often represent the terminus of large ground water flow systems and act as integrators of both upgradient (recharge) and downgradient discharge (evaporation). Ground water levels beneath playa/sabkha systems show a variety of surprising responses driven by large evaporation demands and chemical processes not typically encountered in more humid regions. When the water table is very close to the land surface, almost instantaneous rises can be observed with little observed change in either upgradient ground water recharge or potential evaporation. Conversely, when water tables are several meters below the playa surface, water table responses to interannual variability of recharge can be damped and lag significantly behind such changes. This review of the dynamics of shallow water tables in playa lakes and sabkhat discusses the pertinent hydraulic and solute processes and extracts a simple but comprehensive model based on soil physics for predicting the water table response to either upstream recharge changes or changes in potential evaporation at the playa/sabkha. Solutes and associated authigenic minerals are also shown to be important in discriminating both the causes and effects of water level fluctuations.</abstract>

    <title>Basic Concepts for the Linear Model of Ground Water Level Recession.</title>
    <abstract>Basic concepts are illustrated for the display of ground water level recession as a linear plot on a semilog graph, as first described by Rorabaugh. This exponential decay function can be achieved if there is a definable outflow boundary such as a lake or river and if water levels are expressed relative to the altitude of the boundary. The model can be used to estimate aquifer hydraulic diffusivity. Concepts are illustrated using three finite-difference simulations. One represents the ideal case as described by Rorabaugh, in which the altitude of the outflow boundary is uniform along its length. Another simulation includes a sloping boundary with simple geometry and demonstrates that the model can be used accurately. Based on this simulation, it appears that the ground water level must be expressed relative to the closest point on the outflow boundary. The third simulation includes a sloping boundary and complex boundary shape, and demonstrates departures from the linear model of recession and errors in the estimate of hydraulic diffusivity. Another cause of nonlinearity is the instability of the ground water head profile soon after a recharge event. The nature of these early-time departures will vary depending on the location of the water level observation site relative to the outflow boundary and the hydrologic divide of the ground water flow system.</abstract>

    <title>Antibiotic resistance profiles and cell surface components of salmonellae.</title>
    <abstract>Salmonellae were isolated from raw chilled retail poultry meats (n = 100) using the procedures outlined in the Bacteriological Analytical Manual and Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook. These isolates and 36 Salmonella strains from our laboratory culture collection were tested for their resistance to 12 different antibiotics and for their ability to produce thin aggregative fimbriae and/or cellulose, two of the most important surface components influencing the ability of cells to attach to surfaces and form biofilms. The sensitivity of the salmonellae to the antibiotics was determined with a disc diffusion assay. Of 52 Salmonella isolates, 25 (48.0%) were resistant to one antibiotic, 5 (9.6%) were resistant to two, 4 (7.7%) were resistant to three, 6 (11.5%) were resistant to four, and 5 (9.6%) were resistant to five antibiotics. Two (3.8%) of the isolates were resistant to up to nine of the antibiotics tested. Fifty-one (98%) of the isolates were resistant to novobiocin, 18 (34.6%) were resistant to streptomycin, 14 (26.9%) were resistant to tetracycline, and 14 (26.9%) were resistant to oxytetracycline. In separate experiments, the isolates were grown on Luria-Bertani no-salt agar supplemented with Congo red (40 microgram/ml) and Coomassie brilliant blue (20 microgram/ml) or Calcofluor (200 microgram/ml) to determine whether they produced thin aggregative fimbriae and/or cellulose. Of the total 52 Salmonella isolates, 25 expressed only thin aggregative fimbriae, and 1 synthesized only cellulose. Ten isolates produced both thin aggregative fimbriae and cellulose, and the remaining 16 isolates expressed neither surface structure. The findings of this study reveal a prevalence of Salmonella on raw retail poultry products in central Georgia and suggest that salmonellae have the ability to develop resistance to multiple antibiotics and to synthesize cell surface components that help them survive in hostile or suboptimal environments.</abstract>

    <title>Carbonic Anhydrase and Its Influence on Carbon Isotope Discrimination during C₄ Photosynthesis. Insights from Antisense RNA in Flaveria bidentis</title>
    <abstract>In C₄ plants, carbonic anhydrase (CA) facilitates both the chemical and isotopic equilibration of atmospheric CO₂ and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) in the mesophyll cytoplasm. The CA-catalyzed reaction is essential for C₄ photosynthesis, and the model of carbon isotope discrimination (Δ¹³C) in C₄ plants predicts that changes in CA activity will influence Δ¹³C. However, experimentally, the influence of CA on Δ¹³C has not been demonstrated in C₄ plants. Here, we compared measurements of Δ¹³C during C₄ photosynthesis in Flaveria bidentis wild-type plants with F. bidentis plants with reduced levels of CA due to the expression of antisense constructs targeted to a putative mesophyll cytosolic CA. Plants with reduced CA activity had greater Δ¹³C, which was also evident in the leaf dry matter carbon isotope composition (δ¹³C). Contrary to the isotope measurements, photosynthetic rates were not affected until CA activity was less than 20% of wild type. Measurements of Δ¹³C, δ¹³C of leaf dry matter, and rates of net CO₂ assimilation were all dramatically altered when CA activity was less than 5% of wild type. CA activity in wild-type F. bidentis is sufficient to maintain net CO₂ assimilation; however, reducing leaf CA activity has a relatively large influence on Δ¹³C, often without changes in net CO₂ assimilation. Our data indicate that the extent of CA activity in C₄ leaves needs to be taken into account when using Δ¹³C and/or δ¹³C to model the response of C₄ photosynthesis to changing environmental conditions.</abstract>

    <title>Ascorbate Oxidase-Dependent Changes in the Redox State of the Apoplast Modulate Gene Transcript Accumulation Leading to Modified Hormone Signaling and Orchestration of Defense Processes in Tobacco</title>
    <abstract>The role of the redox state of the apoplast in hormone responses, signaling cascades, and gene expression was studied in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants with modified cell wall-localized ascorbate oxidase (AO). High AO activity specifically decreased the ascorbic acid (AA) content of the apoplast and altered plant growth responses triggered by hormones. Auxin stimulated shoot growth only when the apoplastic AA pool was reduced in wild-type or AO antisense lines. Oxidation of apoplastic AA in AO sense lines was associated with loss of the auxin response, higher mitogen-activated protein kinase activities, and susceptibility to a virulent strain of the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. The total leaf glutathione pool, the ratio of reduced glutathione to glutathione disulfide, and glutathione reductase activities were similar in the leaves of all lines. However, AO sense leaves exhibited significantly lower dehydroascorbate reductase and ascorbate peroxidase activities than wild-type and antisense leaves. The abundance of mRNAs encoding antioxidant enzymes was similar in all lines. However, the day/night rhythms in the abundance of transcripts encoding the three catalase isoforms were changed in response to the AA content of the apoplast. Other transcripts influenced by AO included photorespiratory genes and a plasma membrane Ca²⁺ channel-associated gene. We conclude that the redox state of the apoplast modulates plant growth and defense responses by regulating signal transduction cascades and gene expression patterns. Hence, AO activity, which modulates the redox state of the apoplastic AA pool, strongly influences the responses of plant cells to external and internal stimuli.</abstract>

    <title>Chloroplastic NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase in Tobacco Leaves Functions in Alleviation of Oxidative Damage Caused by Temperature Stress</title>
    <abstract>In this study, the function of the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH)-dependent pathway in suppressing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in chloroplasts was investigated. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) defective in ndhC-ndhK-ndhJ (ΔndhCKJ) at 42°C and 4°C, and in that of wild-type leaves at 4°C. The maximum quantum efficiency of PSII decreased to a similar extent in both strains at 42°C, while it decreased more evidently in ΔndhCKJ at 4°C. The parameters linked to CO₂ assimilation, such as the photochemical efficiency of PSII, the decrease of nonphotochemical quenching following the initial rise, and the photosynthetic O₂ evolution, were inhibited more significantly in ΔndhCKJ than in wild type at 42°C and were seriously inhibited in both strains at 4°C. While cyclic electron flow around PSI mediated by NDH was remarkably enhanced at 42°C and suppressed at 4°C. The proton gradient across the thylakoid membranes and light-dependent ATP synthesis were higher in wild type than in ΔndhCKJ at either 25°C or 42°C, but were barely formed at 4°C. Based on these results, we suggest that cyclic photophosphorylation via the NDH pathway might play an important role in regulation of CO₂ assimilation under heat-stressed condition but is less important under chilling-stressed condition, thus optimizing the photosynthetic electron transport and reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species.</abstract>

    <title>Biochemical and technical observations supporting the use of copepods as live feed organisms in marine larviculture.</title>
    <abstract>The use of live prey is still necessary for a large number of raised fish species. Small sized rotifers are usually used as live preys during the first days of feeding in small mouth fish. An alternative to this is the use of copepods as prey for first feeding. In this study, the sizes, weight and biochemical contents of two copepods and one rotifer species raised on similar algal food conditions were compared. Rotifers contained a higher proportion of essential amino acids in the free amino acid (FAA) fraction (43%) than copepods (30-32%). However, rotifers had lower levels of important fatty acids like DHA (7% compared with 23-32% in copepods) and their DHA/EPA ratio was lower than that in copepods (0.54 compared with 1.35-1.63 in copepods). The FAA pattern of the preys tended to be species-specific and its implications from an aquaculture point of view is discussed. In contrast, the-protein bound amino acids tended to be very conservative among the studied organisms. The second part of the work is focused on 'the price' of hatching in Acartia tonsa eggs before or after cold storage at 3°C. The fatty acid contents in A. tonsa tended to decrease with the storage time. It also decreased with hatching of the nauplii, but its proportion compared with the dry weight remained constant.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of earthworm activity (Aporrectodea giardi) on atrazine adsorption and biodegradation.</title>
    <abstract>We investigated the influence of earthworm (Aporrectodea giardi) activity on soil properties and on atrazine (AT) adsorption and biodegradation by comparing a coarse-textured smectite-free wetland soil (Brittany, France) with the earthworm casts derived from the top horizon of this soil. Casts are characterized by lower pH, are enriched in organic carbon (OC) and clay content, have a larger cation exchange capacity, and a greater exchangeable Ca content. The clay mineralogy of the soil studied and casts is characterized by a muscovite-kaolinite-chlorite association. In addition, the clay fraction of the soil contains lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH), which was not found in the casts. Atrazine adsorption isotherms were reasonably well described by the Freundlich equation and were all non-linear. The mean amounts of adsorbed AT for starting concentrations of 3-30 mg litre⁻¹ ranged from 8 to 34%, being largest in earthworm casts. Soil AT adsorption capacity was well correlated with OC content. Non-decomposed organic matter present in the coarse size fractions and specific compounds present in earthworm casts (proteins, mono- and polysaccharides, polyphenols, sugars, lignin) and microbial and fungal biomass contribute to AT adsorption. Weak electrostatic (physical) sorption of AT on organic compounds and on mineral surfaces prevails. For casts, the formation of additional hydrophobic interactions between AT and SOM is proposed. We also studied AT biodegradation by the model bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP in the presence of soils or earthworm casts. An enhancement of the AT disappearance rate was observed in the presence of all the solid matrices tested compared with that obtained in an aqueous medium. The biodegradation rate was shown to be dependent not only on the OC content of the solid matrix, but mainly on its composition and structure.</abstract>

    <title>The cation exchange capacity of a sandy soil in southern Brazil: an estimation of permanent and pH-dependent charges.</title>
    <abstract>In soils in general, the cation exchange capacity is an important factor in soil fertility because it determines both cation retention and selectivity, and in turn controls most of the other soil properties. The main goal of this paper was to estimate the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the contribution of permanent charges and pH-dependent charges and their respective importance in soil CEC as a function of pH, clay and organic matter content in soils. A multiple regression method was developed from 75 samples under different soil management practices. The permanent charge (~ 140 mmolc kg⁻¹ of clay) estimated by this approach was independent of the analytical method used, i.e. a French method (MF) and a Brazilian method (MB), and is consistent with the presence of 2:1 clay minerals. However, the pH-dependent charges were closely related to the buffering capacity inherent in each protocol (MF protocol using NH₄⁺, and MB using a SMP solution proposed earlier by other workers, both at pH 7). For the MF protocol, the proposed method appeared to be well adapted for reproducing soil component properties under different management conditions. In the soil samples studied, the contribution of organic carbon to negative charges ranged from 12.3 to 55.8% of effective CEC and from 14.1 to 59.2% of CEC at pH 7. However, the clay contribution, notably its permanent charges, can contribute to 31% and more of the CEC in the lower horizons of soil profiles. The proposed approach can accurately evaluate the effective and pH 7 CECs when the MF protocol is used but evaluation is less accurate with the MB protocol.</abstract>

    <title>Distribution of soil organic carbon and phosphorus on an eroded hillslope of the rangeland in the northern Tibet Plateau, China.</title>
    <abstract>Some studies on the relationship between soil erosion and subsequent redeposition of eroded soils in the same field and soil quality have been conducted in croplands, yet few studies have revealed this relationship in rangelands. We selected a toposequence with a slope of 30% and a horizontal length of 342 m from the rangeland in the northern Tibet Autonomous Region, China (31°16'N, 92°09'E) to determine the relationship between soil erosion, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and available P patterns within a hillslope landscape. Soil samples for the determination of ¹³⁷Cs as well as SOC, available P and particle-size fractions were collected at 20 m intervals along a transect of this hillslope. Soil redistribution was caused primarily by wind erosion at toe-slope positions, but primarily by water erosion at the hillslope positions above the toe-slope. In upper- and mid-slope portions (0 m to 244 m horizontal length), SOC content is closely correlated to ¹³⁷Cs concentration (r = 0.74, P < 0.01, n= 15), suggesting that SOC distribution along the slope was similar to ¹³⁷Cs distribution, which itself was dependent on topographic changes. However, SOC contents in toe-slope portions are less than those above the toe-slope (i.e. upper- and mid-slope portions), and the correlation between ¹³⁷Cs and SOC in the toe-slope portion is weaker than that above the toe-slope. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.72, P < 0.001, n= 20) between ¹³⁷Cs concentration and available P was found within the whole hillslope landscape, implying the distribution pattern of available P was somewhat different from that of SOC. We suggest that the distribution of SOC within the hillslope landscape is also affected by factors such as assimilation rates due to difference in grassland productivity at different points and different biological oxidation rates of carbon related to patterns of moisture distribution.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of extender composition and freezing rate on post-thaw motility and fertility of Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), spermatozoa.</title>
    <abstract>The effects of extender composition and freezing rate on motility and fertility of frozen-thawed Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, spermatozoa were investigated. Three freezing rates, two semen diluents and three cryoprotectants were tested. Semen frozen in 0.3 mol L⁻¹ glucose diluent with 10% methanol as a cryoprotectant or in a diluent described by Lahnsteiner with 10%N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) resulted in the highest sperm motility. Fertility was the highest for semen frozen in a glucose-methanol extender but was not significantly different than that for semen frozen in Lahnsteiner's diluent with 10% DMA. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at 10% was a relatively ineffective cryoprotectant with either semen diluent. Semen frozen at 6 cm above the surface of liquid nitrogen resulted in a higher post-thaw sperm motility and fertility than semen frozen at 5 cm. The addition of 7% fresh egg yolk to glucose diluent containing methanol or DMSO did not improve the fertility of frozen-thawed spermatozoa. However, the addition of 7% fresh egg yolk to glucose-DMA extender significantly improved the fertilization percentages of frozen-thawed spermatozoa. In conclusion, dilution of semen 1:3 in 0.3 mol L⁻¹ glucose with 10% methanol and freezing 6 cm above the surface of liquid nitrogen (freezing rate of 40±8°C min⁻¹, mean±SD from -5 to -55°C) is a promising protocol for cryopreservation of Arctic char semen.</abstract>

    <title>Dietary composition manipulation to enhance the performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer Bloch) reared in cool water.</title>
    <abstract>Barramundi Lates calcarifer reared in cool water (20-22°C) grow slowly and feed is used poorly compared with fish in warm water (28-32°C). Two comparative slaughter growth assays were carried out with juvenile barramundi to see if increasing the digestible energy (DE) and/or the n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid (n-3 HUFA) content of the feed would improve growth of fish raised in cool water. Increasing the DE content of the feed from 15 to 17 or 19 MJ kg⁻¹ while maintaining a constant protein to energy ratio in Experiment 1 brought about significant improvements in feed conversion ratio (FCR) (from 2.01 to 1.19) and daily growth coefficient (DGC; from 0.69 to 1.08%/day) for fish at 20°C. For fish at 29°C, improvements, while significant, were of a lesser magnitude: from 1.32 to 0.97 for FCR and from 3.24 to 3.65%/day for DGC. Increasing the absolute amount of dietary n-3 HUFA, expressed as the sum of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids, from 0.5% to 2.0% in Experiment 2 improved DGC linearly and FCR curvilinearly for fish at 29°C whereas at 20°C, DGC was not affected while FCR improved slightly (from 1.83 to 1.68). Feed conversion ratio was optimized with a dietary n-3 HUFA of about 1.5%. Providing barramundi with a feed that is high in DE (viz 19 MJ kg⁻¹) and a digestible protein to DE ratio of 22.5 g MJ⁻¹ is a practical strategy for improving the productivity of barramundi cultured in cool water whereas increasing dietary n-3 HUFA conferred very little additional benefit.</abstract>

    <title>Economic analysis of monosex culture of giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii De Man): a case study.</title>
    <abstract>All-male monosex culture of Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man) has emerged as a popular practice in India, especially in the state of Andhra Pradesh. A study was conducted to compare the economics of all-male, mixed and all-female culture in 15 adjacent, rectangular ponds of 4000 m² each by stocking juveniles previously reared in a nursery for 60 days. The experiment was conducted using a completely randomized design with three treatments; T₁ (all male), T₂ (mixed) and T₃ (all female), and five replicates for a period of 5 months after the nursery phase. Statistical analysis showed highly significant (P<0.01) differences among the three types of culture. The cost of production was estimated and the economic feasibility of the culture methods was evaluated by cost-return and partial budgeting analysis. The average weight, productivity and specific growth rate were the highest for all male culture, being 80.92±2.41 g, 1532 kg ha⁻¹ and 1.97±0.02 respectively. All-female culture registered significantly higher survival (89.16±0.77%) and the best apparent feed conversion ratio of 1.26±0.02. The economic analysis revealed that all-male monosex culture of M. rosenbergii was 63.13% and 60.20% more profitable than mixed and all-female cultures respectively.</abstract>

    <title>Carbon sequestration in a temperate grassland; management and climatic controls.</title>
    <abstract>Soil management practices that result in increased soil carbon (C) sequestration can make a valuable contribution to reducing the increase in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. We studied the effect of poultry manure, cattle slurry, sewage sludge, NH₄NO₃ or urea on C cycling and sequestration in silage grass production. Soil respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and methane (CH₄) fluxes were measured with chambers, and soil samples were analysed for total C and dissolved organic C (DOC). Treatments were applied over 2 years and measurements were carried out over 3 years to assess possible residual effects. Organic fertilizer applications increased CO₂ loss through soil respiration but also enhanced soil C storage compared with mineral fertilizer. Cumulative soil respiration rates were highest in poultry manure treatments with 13.7 t C ha⁻¹ in 2003, corresponding to 1.6 times the control value, but no residual effect was seen. Soil respiration showed an exponential increase with temperature, and a bimodal relationship with soil moisture. The greatest NEE was observed on urea treatments (with a CO₂ uptake of -4.4 g CO₂ m⁻² h⁻¹). Total C and DOC were significantly greater in manure treatments in the soil surface (0-10 cm). Of the C added in the manures, 27% of that in the sewage pellets, 32% of that in the cattle slurry and 39% of that in the poultry manure remained in the 0-10 cm soil layer at the end of the experiment. Mineral fertilizer treatments had only small C sequestration rates, although uncertainties were high. Expressed as global warming potentials, the benefits of increased C sequestration on poultry manure and sewage pellet treatments were outweighed by the additional losses of N₂O, particularly in the wet year 2002. Methane was emitted only for 2-3 days on cattle slurry treatments, but the magnitudes of fluxes were negligible compared with C losses by soil respiration.</abstract>

    <title>Long-term effects of compost amendment of soil on functional and structural diversity and microbial activity.</title>
    <abstract>We studied the effects of applying different composts (urban organic waste, green waste, manure and sewage sludge), mineral fertilizer and compost plus mineral fertilizer on chemical, biological and soil microbiological parameters over a 12-year period. The organic C and total N levels in soils were increased by all compost and compost + N treatments. Microbial biomass C was significantly (P <= 0.05) increased for some compost treatments. In addition, basal respiration and the metabolic quotient (qCO₂) were significantly higher in all soils that had received sewage sludge compost. The Shannon diversity index (H), based on community level physiological profiling, showed a higher consumption of carbon sources in soils treated with compost and compost + N compared with the control. The utilization of different guilds of carbon sources varied amongst the treatments (compost, compost + N or mineral fertilizer). Cluster analysis of polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns showed two major clusters, the first containing the mineral fertilization and compost treatments, and the second, the composts + N treatments. No differences in bacterial community structure could be determined between the different types of compost. However, the results suggest that long-term compost treatments do have effects on the soil biota. The results indicate that the effects on the qCO₂ may be due to shifts in community composition. In this study, it was not possible to distinguish with certainty between the effects of different composts except for compost derived from sewage sludge.</abstract>

    <title>Accessibility for parents of weight management information on the Internet.</title>
    <abstract>The aim of the present study was to describe the accessibility, quality and readability of web base content on the Internet for childhood obesity management from a parental viewpoint. As more than 25% of Australian children are overweight or obese, it is likely that parents access the Internet for advice on obesity management for their child. Links to websites were generated using three search engines and three phrases. The first 10 website links were selected from each of nine searches. Ten aspects of obesity management were identified for the analysis of childhood obesity and related websites. The Fry readability graph was used to assess content readability. The data were analysed using [smallcapital spss] Version 10, Minitab and Microsoft Excel 2000. [smallcapital anova] was used to compare clinical criteria between website type. A total of 90 links were generated with 60 relevant for analysis. In total, 30 were specific to childhood obesity and 47 websites were either obesity-specific or weight-related. Childhood obesity websites were community-based or commercial. Most websites relevant to childhood obesity management came at no cost, in comparison with general weight-related sites. Childhood obesity websites scored generally high on accuracy of content. Overall, website readability was at an undergraduate level. There appears to be a paucity of accessible information on the Internet related to childhood weight management, which parents could access. Childhood obesity management websites should ideally include clinically approved management guidelines and follow e-health codes of ethical practice.</abstract>

    <title>Aggregate-occluded black carbon in soil.</title>
    <abstract>The great stability of black carbon (BC) in soils may not be solely attributable to its refractory structure but also to poor accessibility when physically enveloped by soil particles. Our aim was to elucidate the intensity of physical entrapment of BC within soil aggregates. For this purpose, the A horizon of a forest, and of a grassland soil, and of three soils under tillage, were sampled at the experimental station Rotthalmünster, Germany. Black carbon was assessed in water-stable aggregates and aggregate-density fractions using benzene polycarboxylic acids as specific markers. The greatest BC concentrations made up 7.2% of organic carbon and were found in the < 53 μm fraction. The smallest BC concentrations occurred in the large macroaggregate fractions (> 2 mm). This pattern has been sustained even after tillage. The C-normalized BC concentrations were significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the occluded particulate organic matter (OPOM) fractions than in the free particulate organic matter (FPOM) and the mineral fractions. This enrichment of BC compared with organic carbon in the OPOM fractions amounted to factors of 1.5-2.7. Hence, BC was embedded within microaggregates in preference to other organic carbon compounds. Only 2.5-3.5% of BC was located in the OPOM fraction < 1.6 g cm⁻³, but 22-24% in the OPOM fraction with a density of 1.6-2.0 g cm⁻³. This suggests that BC possibly acted as a binding agent or was selectively enriched during decomposition of protected SOM, or both. Physical inclusion, particularly within microaggregates, could therefore contribute to the long mean-residence times of soil-inherent BC.</abstract>

    <title>Characteristic alterations of quantity and quality of soil organic matter caused by forest fires in continental Mediterranean ecosystems: a solid-state ¹³C NMR study.</title>
    <abstract>The variable effect of different types of forest fires on the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) was analysed by comparing burnt and unburnt soils from six forest ecosystems in central Spain by organic elemental analysis and solid-state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Whole soil samples were collected 1 to 2 years after the fires and included one site affected by two fires within 2 years. The fire-affected soils showed no common pattern with respect to the amount of additional carbon (Cadd) but at all sites, the fire enhanced the aromatic-C content. The weakest fire intensity resulted in the greatest aromatic-C enrichment factor, EFI₍aromatic C₎ indicating the greatest local accumulation of char. The respective Cadd disclosed an EFI₍aromatic C₎ to EFI₍alkyl C₎ ratio, Bchar, of c.1, which supports a small degree of charring. Extensive combustion and volatilization at stronger fire intensities yielded a decrease of EFI₍aromatic C₎ and an increase in Bchar. These trends are in good agreement with fire intensity and forest fuel combustibility in the various sites and therefore these indices could be used to elucidate the quality and quantity of char input that occurs during and after forest fires. No ¹³C NMR evidence for substantial inputs from non-charred plant necromass was found for any of the single-burn soils. The large carboxyl-C content of Cadd is evidence of the occurrence of oxidation reactions very shortly after the fire. In comparing the single and double-burn sites, no additional char input was observed for the double-burn site, possibly because of complete combustion of young shrubs and char remains during the second fire. The large O-alkyl-C portion found in Cadd of the double-burn soil is best explained by decreased litter degradation.</abstract>

    <title>Analysis of Steady Ground Water Flow Toward Wells in a Confined-Unconfined Aquifer.</title>
    <abstract>A confined aquifer may become unconfined near the pumping wells when the water level falls below the confining unit in the case where the pumping rate is great and the excess hydraulic head over the top of the aquifer is small. Girinskii's potential function is applied to analyze the steady ground water flow induced by pumping wells with a constant-head boundary in a mixed confined-unconfined aquifer. The solution of the single-well problem is derived, and the critical radial distance at which the flow changes from confined to unconfined condition is obtained. Using image wells and the superposition method, an analytic solution is presented to study steady ground water flow induced by a group of pumping wells in an aquifer bounded by a river with constant head. A dimensionless function is introduced to determine whether a water table condition exists or not near the pumping wells. An example with three pumping wells is used to demonstrate the patterns of potentiometric surface and development of water table around the wells.</abstract>

    <title>Biosynthesis of Ascorbic Acid in Legume Root Nodules</title>
    <abstract>Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a major antioxidant and redox buffer, but is also involved in other critical processes of plants. Recently, the hypothesis has been proposed that legume nodules are unable to synthesize ascorbate and have to import it from the shoot or root, thus providing a means by which the plant regulates nodule senescence. The last step of ascorbate biosynthesis in plants is catalyzed by L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH). The mRNAs encoding GalLDH and three other enzymes involved in ascorbate biosynthesis are clearly detectable in nodules. Furthermore, an active membrane-bound GalLDH enzyme is present in nodule mitochondria. Biochemical assays on dissected nodules reveal that GalLDH activity and ascorbate are correlated in nodule tissues and predominantly localized in the infected zone, with lower levels of both parameters (relative to the infected tissues) in the apex (87%) and senescent region (43%) of indeterminate nodules and in the peripheral tissues (65%) of determinate nodules. In situ RNA hybridization showed that the GalLDH mRNA is particularly abundant in the infected zone of indeterminate and determinate nodules. Thus, our results refute the hypothesis that ascorbate is not synthesized in nodules and lend support to a previous conclusion that ascorbate in the infected zone is primarily involved in the protection of host cells against peroxide damage. Likewise, the high ascorbate and GalLDH activity levels found in the apex of indeterminate nodules strongly suggest a participation of ascorbate in additional functions during symbiosis, possibly related to cell growth and division and to molecular signaling.</abstract>

    <title>Dietary protein, growth, nutrient utilization and body composition of juvenile blackspot seabream, Pagellus bogaraveo (Brunnich).</title>
    <abstract>When considering new marine species for Mediterranean aquaculture, blackspot seabream emerges as a potential candidate. However, there are scarce data on the nutritional requirements and optimal growth conditions of this species. A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary protein on growth, nutrient utilization and body composition of blackspot seabream (23 g). Five isolipidic diets (12%) with graded levels of protein (20-60%) were distributed, twice a day, to duplicate groups of fish, until satiation. Growth increased significantly with increasing dietary protein up to 40%, but higher protein levels induced a similar daily growth index (1.4). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreased with increasing levels of dietary protein (4.2-1.6). No significant differences were detected in protein of whole body blackspot seabream among treatments, but fat percentage decreased with increasing dietary protein. Dry matter and energy digestibility showed a concomitant increase with the reduction in dietary wheat meal, attaining maximal values with high protein diets. These results suggested that the most favourable values for growth and FCR are obtained with diets containing 40% protein. However, the excessive lipid deposition reveals that more nutritional studies are necessary before the species can be established in aquaculture.</abstract>

    <title>Genotypic and temperature effects on wheat grain yield and quality in a hot irrigated environment</title>
    <abstract>High temperature influences both grain yield and end-use quality of wheat. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of selected wheat genotypes under heat stress and to examine the effects of high temperatures during grain filling on grain yield and end-use quality parameters. Fifteen bread wheat genotypes in 2000/2001 and 18 genotypes in 2002/2003 were evaluated under the optimum and late-sowing conditions of the irrigated hot environment of the Gezira Research Farm, Wad Medani, Sudan. The genotypes comprised released varieties and elite lines from the Sudanese wheat improvement programme. Data collected included grain yield, grain weight and grain end-use quality including protein content, protein composition, SDS sedimentation values (SDSS) and gluten strength as determined by mixograph analyses. High temperatures significantly decreased grain yield by decreasing grain weight. Although genotypes exhibited variation in magnitude of response, results indicated that high temperature during grain filling increased both soluble and insoluble protein contents, SDSS, mixograph peak height (MPH) and the descending slope at 2 min past peak (MDS). In contrast, mixograph peak time (MPT) and the curve width at 2 min past peak (MCW) were significantly decreased. Flour protein correlated positively with SDSS, MPH and MDS and negatively with MCW. MPT correlated negatively with MDS and positively with MCW. Results indicate that high temperature increased both soluble and insoluble protein contents, SDSS and MPH, and hence the gluten strength, but decreased flour mixing time and tolerance and hence the dough elasticity. Variation observed among genotypes suggests that grain end-use quality could be improved under high temperature conditions utilizing the available variability; however, it might require evaluation under various growing conditions.</abstract>

    <title>Development of Polima temperature-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterile lines of Brassica napus through isolated microspore culture</title>
    <abstract>A novel Pol CMS named Polima temperature-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterile (Pol TCMS) is sterile at high temperatures and partially fertile at low temperatures. Its temperature sensitivity is controlled by several minor genes, and probably influenced by the genetic background, making it quite difficult to breed a stable Pol TCMS line through the conventional breeding methods. The present study aimed to obtain stable homozygous Pol TCMS lines by microspore culture. The highest frequency of embryogenesis was induced from cultures of buds sampled at 4-7 days before first blossom. The second method of microspore cultures mentioned in this study could significantly increase the production of embryos. Analysis of fatty acid composition, glucosinolate content and genetic diversity by simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers indicated that microspore culture was effective for selecting Pol TCMS lines.</abstract>

    <title>Characterization of novel sugarcane expressed sequence tag microsatellites and their comparison with genomic SSRs</title>
    <abstract>Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are one of the most suitable markers for genome analysis as they have great potential to aid breeders to develop new improved sugarcane varieties. The development of SSR derived from expressed sequence tags (EST) opens new opportunities for genetic investigations at a functional level. In the present work, the polymorphism obtained with a subset of 51 EST-SSRs derived from [smallcapital sucest] was compared with those generated by 50 genomic SSRs (gSSR) in terms of number of alleles, polymorphism information content, discrimination power and their ability to establish genetic relationships among 18 sugarcane clones including three Saccharum species (S. officinarum, S. barberi, S. sinense). The majority of EST-SSRs loci had four to six alleles in contrast to the seven to nine observed for the gSSRs loci. Approximately, 35% of the gSSRs had PIC values around 0.90 in contrast to 15% of the EST-SSRs. However, the mean discrimination power of the two types of SSR did not differ significantly as much as the average genetic similarity (GS) based on Dice coefficient. The correlation between GS of the two types of SSRs was high (r = 0.71/P = 0.99) and significant. Although differences were observed between dendrograms obtained with each SSR type, both were in good agreement with pedigree information. The S. officinarum clone IJ76-314 was grouped apart from the other clones evaluated. The results here demonstrate that EST-SSRs can be successfully used for genetic relationship analysis, extending the knowledge of genetic diversity of sugarcane to a functional level.</abstract>

    <title>Genetically manipulated pineapple: transgene stability, gene expression and herbicide tolerance under field conditions</title>
    <abstract>Pineapple plants transformed with the bar gene for bialaphos resistance were evaluated for transgene stability, gene expression and tolerance to glufosinate ammonium, the active ingredient of the herbicide Basta® X, under field conditions. Genetically modified plants of the cv. Phuket were micropropagated, rooted and established in a shade house before transfer to an experimental plot. Seven months after transfer to the field, plants were tolerant to 1600 ml/rai of the herbicide Basta® X (stock concentration 15% w/v glufosinate ammonium), this being twice the dose recommended for field application of the herbicide. Genetically modified plants remained green and healthy following spraying with the herbicide. In contrast, non-transformed pineapple plants of the same cv. became necrotic and died within 21 days of spraying with the herbicide at a reduced concentration of 800 ml/rai. Bar gene stability and expression in clonally-derived plants were assessed by PCR, RT-PCR and Southern analyses at 120, 210, 240, 270 and 380 days following transfer of the plants to the field. The bar gene was stable and expressed in transgenic plants throughout the duration of the trial. Fruit characteristics and yield were not affected by transgene introduction and expression. Transgenic plants tolerant to glufosinate ammonium should facilitate more effective weed control in pineapple plantations without damage to the crop.</abstract>

    <title>Purification, characterization, and gene cloning of 46 kDa chitinase (Chi46) from Trichoderma reeseiPC-3-7 and its expression in Escherichia coli</title>
    <abstract>We purified a chitinase (named Chi46), with a molecular mass of 46 kDa estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, from the culture filtrate of Trichoderma reesei PC-3-7 grown on N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). The relative activity of this enzyme reduced when the degrees of acetylation (DA) of chitosan decreased. Furthermore, the enzyme was able to hydrolyze colloidal chitin and ethylene glycol chitin. The gene chi46 was cloned and sequenced. chi46 encodes a protein of 424 amino acid residues containing a 35-amino acid prepro-type secretion signal peptide. The molecular mass of mature Chi46 calculated from deduced amino acid sequence was 42,265 Da. The chi46 transcript was biphasic when the mycelia were grown on GlcNAc, suggesting that the multiple regulatory proteins are involved in the chi46 expression. The chi46 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli (ca. 0.23 mg/ml culture). To determine substrate cleavage fashion of Chi46 in more detail, we carried out high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and viscosimetric assay using recombinant Chi46 (rChi46). Chi46 was shown to release mainly (GlcNAc)2 from colloidal chitin (insoluble chitin) as an exo-type manner and to act on chitosan 7B (DA ca. 30%) and N-acetylchitooligosaccharides (soluble chitins) in an endo-type one.</abstract>

    <abstract>Mating tests, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis, intergenic spacer 1-restriction fragment length polymorphism (IGS1-RFLP), IGS1 sequence analysis, and IGS2-RFLP analysis were carried out on isolates of 17 morphologically different Pleurotus mushrooms collected on Ferula sinkiangensis. The isolates were divided, based on mating tests and ITS sequence analysis, into two groups identical to P. eryngii var. ferulae and P. nebrodensis, respectively. Single spores from these two groups were incompatible, but those from P. eryngii var. ferulae and P. eryngii were compatible and combined to produce 56.25% dikaryon mycelia with clamp connections. The ITS of P. eryngii var. ferulae and P. nebrodensis (GenBank accession no. AY311408) were both 638 bp in size but differed by 3% in sequence. P. eryngii var. ferulae and P. eryngii (GenBank accession no. AY368658) were identical in ITS size and sequence. P. nebrodensis was the dominant population of Pleurotus mushroom growing on F. sinkiangensis. It exhibited genetic diversity. The two species could also be distinguished by IGSI-RFLP, similar to identification by mating tests and ITS sequence analysis. Difference in IGS1-RFLP existed between P. eryngii var. ferulae and P. nebrodensis. The sequence difference reached 2.28%. Both IGS1 size and IGS1-RFLP were similar among the different samples of P. nebrodensis. The 17 isolates were separated into five types based on IGS2 size and IGS2-RFLP, with both interspecies and extraspecies differences. P. nebrodensis exhibited polymorphism and was divided into four types. These results agreed with macroscopic differences. IGS2 might be the effective domain of genetically polymorphic ribosomal DNA in P. nebrodensis mushrooms found in Xinjiang, China.</abstract>

    <title>CHARACTERIZATION OF RECONSTITUTED MILK POWDER BY ULTRASOUND SPECTROSCOPY.</title>
    <abstract>When instant milk powder (IMP) is reconstituted with water, the product should resemble fresh milk. However, undissolved particles were found at the surface and in the bulk of the product. A visual reconstitution test (RT) is made on IMP to determine the reconstituted quality of the product. This test is directly linked to the presence of the undissolved particles. The particles found at the surface are formed by clustered liquid-fat aggregates, which rise to the top of the milk and may give an impression of spoiled milk. The particles found in the bulk are small particles in the solution mostly composed of a protein gel. Because the repeatability and precision of the RT are very poor, a quantitative analytical technique is desirable. In this study we investigated five different quality milk powders by an ultrasound spectroscopy technique. The ultrasonic velocity and attenuation parameters were measured with a frequency scanning pulse echo reflectometer. We found that the ultrasonic velocity cannot be correlated to RT because the predominant phenomenon that affects the ultrasonic velocity is the physical state of the different components of the milk matrix (liquid fat, crystalline fat and lactose crystals), and this physical state is not a significant factor in powder quality. However, the ultrasonic attenuation coefficient is well correlated with RT. This is because, between two different quality powders, the most important factor that causes variation in the attenuation is scattering, correlated to particle size and to volume fraction rather than by the composition or physical state of the matrix and the same particle size factor, and volume fraction factor characterizes the powder reconstitution's quality.</abstract>

    <abstract>Bitter taste of extra virgin olive oil is known to be affected by the phenolic composition. However, contribution of each individual phenol to this sensory note has not been clearly defined. The aims of this study were to verify whether there was a relationship between bitter sensation and phenolic compound concentration, to determine which compounds were involved in bitter taste and to evaluate quantitatively this correlation. Results confirmed that a positive correlation did exist between total phenolic amount and bitter intensity. Data processing showed that this correlation was significantly dependent upon a relationship between oleuropein aglycon (3,4-DHPEA-EA) and bitter intensity. An empirical exponential model was set up and validated.</abstract>

    <title>Bacterial load reduction of live prey for fish larval feeding using Ox-Aquaculture©</title>
    <abstract>Reduction of the bacterial load in live prey is paramount to achieving efficient microbiological control during fish larval rearing. Several methods have been tested using physical and chemical disinfection procedures. Nevertheless, chemicals are difficult to deal with because of the frequent problems encountered when disposing of their residual products and because of the sensitivity of the live prey. Hydrogen peroxide is a good disinfectant that has been used for a long time in other fields of research and decomposes in non-toxic products. However, it has not been applied for disinfection in aquaculture until recent years. The effects of a hydrogen peroxide-based product, Ox-Aquaculture©, on rotifers and Artemia nauplii survival and on their associated microbial population have been tested in the present study, a disinfection protocol is proposed, and its effects on live prey fatty acids composition after enrichment were checked. More than 80% survival and a 90% reduction of total heterotrophic bacteria and Vibrionaceae were obtained in rotifers exposed for 15 min to 40 mg L⁻¹ of the product. In the case of Artemia nauplii, 90% survival and 94.5% reduction of heterotrophic bacteria were obtained after 5 min exposure to 8000 mg L⁻¹ with a further 82.8% reduction of Vibrionaceae. No differences in the fatty acid composition of the live prey were detected after disinfection with hydrogen peroxide. No oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids was observed. A short time exposure and easy removal of the product from the treated live prey make hydrogen peroxide an interesting chemical for industrial application.</abstract>

    <title>Demand for rural tourism: the effects of quality and information</title>
    <abstract>The development of rural tourism is regarded as a promising diversification strategy especially for lagging and mountainous areas of the European Union. Research concerning the demand and/or supply of rural tourism services has been limited within the agricultural economics domain despite the significance attached to rural tourism by various rural development policy measures and initiatives. The article examines the expenditure behavior of rural tourists within a framework of demand for composite (heterogeneous) goods. The proposed framework captures the quality of the tourism experience as the commodity's unit value, a quantifiable economic variable, examines its effects on expenditures and allows for the estimation of elasticity in prices regarding expenditure and quantity. Empirical analysis is facilitated by a survey recording the expenditure behavior of 465 tourists in two rural and lagging areas of Greece. The quality of the tourism experience is significantly and positively affected by the income, the source from which information about the trip is retrieved (Internet, newspapers as well as general press and special travel press) and by the amount of information sought by the consumer prior to the trip. In turn, the quality of the tourism experience is the major endogenous factor that positively influences expenditures for rural tourism. Further research is needed before evidence provided in this work can be used to draw policy conclusions and recommendations.</abstract>

For the very first time, room temperature and daylight storage were used to mimic the actual household storage conditions. Results clearly indicate that peroxide value increases rapidly above the threshold value; there was also an increase of free fatty acids and acidity and strong sensory quality loss upon storage in PET bottles.

DHPE was the most potent antioxidant among all antioxidants tested using 10% emulsion and deep-fat frying at 180C. It was also a very good antioxidant at room temperature in lard and soybean oil.

    <title>Analysis of the Subcellular Localization, Function, and Proteolytic Control of the Arabidopsis Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor ICK1/KRP1</title>
    <abstract>Recent studies have shown that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors can have a tremendous impact on cell cycle progression in plants. In animals, CDK inhibitors are tightly regulated, especially by posttranslational mechanisms of which control of nuclear access and regulation of protein turnover are particularly important. Here we address the posttranslational regulation of INHIBITOR/INTERACTOR OF CDK 1 (ICK1)/KIP RELATED PROTEIN 1 (KRP1), an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CDK inhibitor. We show that ICK1/KRP1 exerts its function in the nucleus and its presence in the nucleus is controlled by multiple nuclear localization signals as well as by nuclear export. In addition, we show that ICK1/KRP1 localizes to different subnuclear domains, i.e. in the nucleoplasm and to the chromocenters, hinting at specific actions within the nuclear compartment. Localization to the chromocenters is mediated by an N-terminal domain, in addition we find that this domain may be involved in cyclin binding. Further we demonstrate that ICK1/KRP1 is an unstable protein and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the nucleus. This degradation is mediated by at least two domains indicating the presence of at least two different pathways impinging on ICK1/KRP1 protein stability.</abstract>

    <title>Bestatin, an Inhibitor of Aminopeptidases, Provides a Chemical Genetics Approach to Dissect Jasmonate Signaling in Arabidopsis</title>
    <abstract>Bestatin, a potent inhibitor of some aminopeptidases, was shown previously to be a powerful inducer of wound-response genes in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Here, we present several lines of evidence showing that bestatin specifically activates jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in plants. First, bestatin specifically activates the expression of JA-inducible genes in tomato and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Second, the induction of JA-responsive genes by bestatin requires the COI1-dependent JA-signaling pathway, but does not depend strictly on JA biosynthesis. Third, microarray analysis using Arabidopsis whole-genome chip demonstrates that the gene expression profile of bestatin-treated plants is similar to that of JA-treated plants. Fourth, bestatin promotes a series of JA-related developmental phenotypes. Taken together, the unique action mode of bestatin in regulating JA-signaled processes leads us to the hypothesis that bestatin exerts its effects through the modulation of some key regulators in JA signaling. We have employed bestatin as an experimental tool to dissect JA signaling through a chemical genetic screening, which yielded a collection of Arabidopsis bestatin-resistant (ber) mutants that are insensitive to the inhibitory effects of bestatin on root elongation. Further characterization efforts demonstrate that some ber mutants are defective in various JA-induced responses, which allowed us to classify the ber mutants into three phenotypic groups: JA-insensitive ber mutants, JA-hypersensitive ber mutants, and mutants insensitive to bestatin but showing normal response to JA. Genetic and phenotypic analyses of the ber mutants with altered JA responses indicate that we have identified several novel loci involved in JA signaling.</abstract>

    <title>Activation of Ntf4, a Tobacco Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, during Plant Defense Response and Its Involvement in Hypersensitive Response-Like Cell Death</title>
    <abstract>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are important signaling modules in eukaryotic cells. They function downstream of sensors/receptors and regulate cellular responses to external and endogenous stimuli. Recent studies demonstrated that SIPK and WIPK, two tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) MAPKs, are involved in signaling plant defense responses to various pathogens. Ntf4, another tobacco MAPK that shares 93.6% and 72.3% identity with SIPK and WIPK, respectively, was reported to be developmentally regulated and function in pollen germination. We found that Ntf4 is also expressed in leaves and suspension-cultured cells. Genomic analysis excluded the possibility that Ntf4 and SIPK are orthologs from the two parental lines of the amphidiploid common tobacco. In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation and activation assays revealed that Ntf4 shares the same upstream MAPK kinase, NtMEK2, with SIPK and WIPK. Similar to SIPK and WIPK, Ntf4 is also stress responsive and can be activated by cryptogein, a proteinaceous elicitin from oomycetic pathogen Phytophthora cryptogea. Tobacco recognition of cryptogein induces rapid hypersensitive response (HR) cell death in tobacco. Transgenic Ntf4 plants with elevated levels of Ntf4 protein showed accelerated HR cell death when treated with cryptogein. In addition, conditional overexpression of Ntf4, which results in high cellular Ntf4 activity, is sufficient to induce HR-like cell death. Based on these results, we concluded that Ntf4 is multifunctional. In addition to its role in pollen germination, Ntf4 is also a component downstream of NtMEK2 in the MAPK cascade that regulates pathogen-induced HR cell death in tobacco.</abstract>

    <title>The Arabidopsis Flavin-Dependent Monooxygenase FMO1 Is an Essential Component of Biologically Induced Systemic Acquired Resistance</title>
    <abstract>Upon localized attack by necrotizing pathogens, plants gradually develop increased resistance against subsequent infections at the whole-plant level, a phenomenon known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). To identify genes involved in the establishment of SAR, we pursued a strategy that combined gene expression information from microarray data with pathological characterization of selected Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) T-DNA insertion lines. A gene that is up-regulated in Arabidopsis leaves inoculated with avirulent or virulent strains of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola (Psm) showed homology to flavin-dependent monooxygenases (FMO) and was designated as FMO1. An Arabidopsis knockout line of FMO1 proved to be fully impaired in the establishment of SAR triggered by avirulent (Psm avrRpm1) or virulent (Psm) bacteria. Loss of SAR in the fmo1 mutants was accompanied by the inability to initiate systemic accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and systemic expression of diverse defense-related genes. In contrast, responses at the site of pathogen attack, including increases in the levels of the defense signals SA and jasmonic acid, camalexin accumulation, and expression of various defense genes, were induced in a similar manner in both fmo1 mutant and wild-type plants. Consistently, the fmo1 mutation did not significantly affect local disease resistance toward virulent or avirulent bacteria in naive plants. Induction of FMO1 expression at the site of pathogen inoculation is independent of SA signaling, but attenuated in the Arabidopsis eds1 and pad4 defense mutants. Importantly, FMO1 expression is also systemically induced upon localized P. syringae infection. This systemic up-regulation is missing in the SAR-defective SA pathway mutants sid2 and npr1, as well as in the defense mutant ndr1, indicating a close correlation between systemic FMO1 expression and SAR establishment. Our findings suggest that the presence of the FMO1 gene product in systemic tissue is critical for the development of SAR, possibly by synthesis of a metabolite required for the transduction or amplification of a signal during the early phases of SAR establishment in systemic leaves.</abstract>

    <title>Diel and ontogenetic body density change in Pacific bluefin tuna, Thunnus orientalis (Temminck and Schlegel), larvae</title>
    <abstract>Diel and ontogenetic changes in larval body density related to swim bladder volume were investigated in Pacific bluefin tuna, Thunnus orientalis, to determine the causality of larval mortality - adhesion to the water surface and contact with the tank bottom during seedling production. The density of larvae with deflated swim bladders increased with total length and days post hatch. Diel density change was observed after day 2 post hatch; owing to daytime deflation and night-time inflation of the swim bladder, the density was relatively higher during the daytime. Increased swim bladder volumes clearly reduced larval density during the night-time after day 9 post hatch. However, the density of larvae with inflated swim bladders was greater than rearing water density (Δρ>0.0099). The small density difference between larvae and rearing water (Δρ=0.0022-0.0100) until day 4 post hatch may have caused larval mortality by adhesion to the water surface because larvae can be easily transported to the water surface by aeration-driven upwelling in rearing tanks. Density increased noticeably from day 5 to day 9 post hatch. The increased density difference (Δρ=0.0065-0.0209) in larvae and rearing water possibly induced mortality by contact with the tank bottom because larvae sink particularly during the night-time on ceasing swimming.</abstract>

    <title>An Assessment of Aquifer Storage Recovery Using Ground Water Flow Models.</title>
    <abstract>Owing to increased demands on ground water accompanied by increased drawdowns, technologies that use recharge options, such as aquifer storage recovery (ASR), are being used to optimize available water resources and reduce adverse effects of pumping. In this paper, three representative ground water flow models were created to assess the impact of hydrogeologic and operational parameters/factors on recovery efficiency of ASR systems. Flow/particle tracking and solute transport models were used to track the movement of water during injection, storage, and recovery. Results from particle tracking models consistently produced higher recovery efficiency than the solute transport models for the parameters/properties examined because the particle tracking models neglected mixing of the injected and ambient water. Mixing between injected and ambient water affected recovery efficiency. Results from this study demonstrate the interactions between hydrogeologic and operational parameters on predictions of recovery efficiency. These interactions are best simulated using coupled numerical ground water flow and transport models that include the effects of mixing of injected water and ambient ground water.</abstract>

    <title>Estimating Background and Threshold Nitrate Concentrations Using Probability Graphs.</title>
    <abstract>Because of the ubiquitous nature of anthropogenic nitrate ( [graphic removed]) in many parts of the world, determining background concentrations of [graphic removed] in shallow ground water from natural sources is probably impossible in most environments. Present-day background must now include diffuse sources of [graphic removed] such as disruption of soils and oxidation of organic matter, and atmospheric inputs from products of combustion and evaporation of ammonia from fertilizer and livestock waste. Anomalies can be defined as [graphic removed] derived from nitrogen (N) inputs to the environment from anthropogenic activities, including synthetic fertilizers, livestock waste, and septic effluent. Cumulative probability graphs were used to identify threshold concentrations separating background and anomalous NO₃-N concentrations and to assist in the determination of sources of N contamination for 232 spring water samples and 200 well water samples from karst aquifers. Thresholds were 0.4, 2.5, and 6.7 mg/L for spring water samples, and 0.1, 2.1, and 17 mg/L for well water samples. The 0.4 and 0.1 mg/L values are assumed to represent thresholds for present-day precipitation. Thresholds at 2.5 and 2.1 mg/L are interpreted to represent present-day background concentrations of NO₃-N. The population of spring water samples with concentrations between 2.5 and 6.7 mg/L represents an amalgam of all sources of [graphic removed] in the ground water basins that feed each spring; concentrations >6.7 mg/L were typically samples collected soon after springtime application of synthetic fertilizer. The 17 mg/L threshold (adjusted to 15 mg/L) for well water samples is interpreted as the level above which livestock wastes dominate the N sources.</abstract>

    <title>Detection and quantification of Phytophthora ramorum, P. kernoviae, P. citricola and P. quercina in symptomatic leaves by multiplex real-time PCR</title>
    <abstract>New species of Phytophthora such as Phytophthora ramorum, P. kernoviae and P. quercina together with P. citricola are plant pathogens which impact on forest health, natural ecosystem stability and international trade. A real-time multiplex PCR approach based on TaqMan PCR was developed to simultaneously identify and detect these four Phytophthora species. Specific primers and probes labelled with FAM (P. ramorum), Yakima Yellow (P. kernoviae), Rox (P. citricola) and Cy5 (P. quercina) were designed in different regions of the ras-related protein (Ypt1) gene. A new set of Black Hole Quenchers (BHQ), which dissipate energy as heat rather than fluorescence, were utilized. The method proved to be highly specific in tests with target DNA from 72 Phytophthora isolates (35 species). For all pathogens, the detection limit was 100 fg of target DNA and was not improved utilizing a nested approach to provide a first round of amplification with Phytophthora spp.-specific primers. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were linearly correlated with the concentration of the target DNA (correlation coefficients ranged from 0.947 to 0.996) and were not affected by the presence of plant extracts, indicating the appropriateness of the method for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Two universal primers and a TaqMan probe were also developed to evaluate the quality and quantity of extracted DNA and to avoid false negatives. The reliability of the entire procedure was assessed using both artificially and naturally infected leaves of a range of plant species. The method, combined with a rapid procedure for DNA extraction, proved to be rapid, reliable, sensitive and cost effective as multiple pathogens were detected within the same plant extract by using different primer/probe combinations.</abstract>

    <title>Comparison of an institutional nutrition screen with 4 validated nutrition screening tools.</title>
    <abstract>Nutrition screening continues to play a vital role as registered dietitians integrate the nutrition care process into daily practice. This pilot study compares the nutrition screening tool currently used by the Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minn, with 4 validated nutrition screens: Mini Nutritional Assessment Screening Form, Veterans Affairs Nutrition Status Classification system, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, and the screening tool developed by Brugler et al to determine whether they are consistent in properly identifying patients who are malnourished or at risk for malnutrition. A secondary aim is to determine whether an existing validated screening tool is equally or more effective than the present hospital practice. This pilot study identified the areas for improving both the nutrition screening tool and how this information is communicated at the Hennepin County Medical Center. Ongoing efforts are underway to revise the screening parameters used and to collaborate with nursing staff to improve the accuracy and timeliness of nutrition screening results.</abstract>

    <title>Ethyloxanilates as specific male gametocides for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)</title>
    <abstract>Induction of male sterility by deployment of male gametocides holds immense potential in heterosis breeding of wheat. The efficacy of a new class of male gametocide for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is described: ethyloxanilates, the most active example of this class being ethyl 4-fluorooxanilate (E4FO). E4FO induces male sterility, specifically, without detectable effects on various agronomic features and female fertility. The plants sprayed once with 0.15% E4FO exhibited 100% pollen and floret sterility without causing a significant reduction in total yield. E4FO was screened on 29 genotypes of wheat at 0.15% test concentration and was observed to induce 99.76 ± 0.37% male sterility. Thirteen F₁-hybrids of wheat were produced using the gametocide in Winter 2000-2001 and were evaluated for their agronomic performance in Winter 2001-2002. The cross combinations viz., lines WR 544 x HW 2046 and HW 2044 x WR 956 have outperformed their respective better parents by 48.17% and 23.42% in grain yield/plant and thus have potential as hybrids.</abstract>

    <title>Evaluation of cold hardiness in two sets of near-isogenic lines of wheat (Triticum aestivum) with polymorphic vernalization alleles</title>
    <abstract>In wheat, variation at the orthologus Vrn-1 loci, located on each of the three genomes, A, B and D, is responsible for vernalization response. A dominant Vrn-1a allele on any of the three wheat genomes results in spring habit and the presence of recessive Vrn-1b alleles on all three genomes results in winter habit. Two sets of near-isogenic lines (NILs) were evaluated for DNA polymorphisms at their Vrn-A1, B1 and D1 loci and for cold hardiness. Two winter wheat cultivars, 'Daws' and 'Wanser' were used as recurrent parents and 'Triple Dirk' NILs were used as donor parents for orthologous Vrn-1 alleles. The NILs were analysed using molecular markers specific for each allele. Only 26 of 32 'Daws' NILs and 23 of 32 'Wanser' NILs had a plant growth habit that corresponded to the marker genotype for the markers used. Freezing tests were conducted in growth chambers programmed to cool to -21.5°C. Relative area under the death progress curve (AUDPC), with a maximum value of 100 was used as a measure of death due to freezing. The average relative AUDPC of the spring habit 'Daws'Vrn-A1a NILs was 86.15; significantly greater than the corresponding winter habit 'Daws'Vrn-A1b NILs (42.98). In contrast, all the 'Daws'Vrn-A1bVrn-B1aVrn-D1b and Vrn-A1bVrn-B1bVrn-D1a NILs (spring habit) had relative AUDPC values equal to those of their 'Daws' sister genotypes with Vrn-A1bVrn-B1bVrn-D1b NILs (winter habit). The average AUDPC of spring and winter habit 'Wanser' NILs differed at all three Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 locus comparisons. We conclude that 'Daws' and 'Wanser' have different background genetic interactions with the Vrn-1 loci influencing cold hardiness. The marker for Vrn-A1 is diagnostic for growth habit and cold hardiness but there is no relationship between the Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 markers and the cold tolerance of the NILs used in this study.</abstract>

    <title>Aegilops kotschyi and Aegilops tauschii as sources for higher levels of grain Iron and Zinc</title>
    <abstract>Micronutrient malnutrition affects a very large proportion of the world's population. For combating micronutrient malnutrition, biofortification through genetic manipulation has been proposed as an alternative to traditional fortification for increasing the bioavailable nutrient content of food crops. Wheat, being a staple food for a large section of the world's population, is targeted for increasing the Fe and Zn content in the grains. The cultivated germplasm of wheat does not have sufficient variability for grain Fe and Zn content but the wild species of wheat do show wider variation for grain micronutrient density. The analysis of Aegilops kotschyi and A. tauschii for Fe and Zn content in the grains using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) indicated that the S and D genome species accumulate significantly higher iron and zinc in the grains than the cultivated wheats. One of the CIMMYT synthetics also had significantly higher Fe and Zn in the grains as compared with the cultivated wheats. Aegilops kotschyi as a promising source for Fe and Zn, is reported for the first time. A systematic programme to identify and utilize the additional sources for high Fe and Zn has been initiated.</abstract>

    <title>Certain reproductive characteristics of the freshwater mussel Unio terminalis delicates (Lea, 1863) in Gölbaşı Lake, Turkey</title>
    <abstract>The aquaculture potential of Unio terminalis has been considered, but is hindered by a lack of knowledge about the reproductive characteristics that promote yields. The present study describes the seasonal reproductive cycle, gonad structure and sex ratio of the freshwater mussel U. terminalis. A total of 695 individuals were collected in monthly samples from October 2004 to September 2005 in Gölbaşι Lake, Turkey. Calculation of the gonadosomatic index and histological examination of the gonads showed that gametogenesis began in winter, and spawning occurred in summer and early autumn. Five stages of oogenesis and five stages of spermatogenesis were identified. Spermatogenesis followed a pattern similar to that of typical oogenesis. The population consisted of dioecious individuals. Although sex ratios of U. terminalis were not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio (P>0.05), slightly female-biased sex ratios were recorded. These results and existing data on mussel meat, phytoplankton production, availability of mussel spat, water quality and growth performance suggest that U. terminalis would be a great source for use in future aquaculture attempts.</abstract>

    <title>Daily variation in short-term static toxicity of unionized ammonia in Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone) postlarvae</title>
    <abstract>Ammonium toxicity of short-duration alkaline events and their variability, as related to 1-30 day-old postlarvae whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone), was assessed by determining medium lethal concentration (LC50) of total ammonium-nitroen (TAN) and NH3-N to 4-h exposures. Exploratory concentrations of TAN were tested at 30°C and pH 9, until mortality from 5% to 95% occurred between 0.9 and 18 mg N L-1. To determine the daily variation of ammonium toxicity, 64 lots of 20 postlarvae were exposed to eight different ammonium concentrations (0, 0.9, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 mg N L-1), in two different environmental scenarios: α (pH 8, 26°C) and β (pH 9, 30°C). In environmental scenario α, ammonium concentrations up to 18 mg L-1 pose no short-term mortality risks for ages 1-30 days. In scenario β, mortality was recorded at all ages. The values of LC50 (4 h) for different postlarvae ages have daily variability, ranging from a minimum of 2.54 to a maximum of 6.02 mg L-1 of TAN (0.76 and 1.81 mg N L-1 of NH3-N), for PL3 and PL19, respectively, with a logarithmic linear tendency to increase with age. Postlarvae mortality at 4 h and 3.0 mg N L-1 TAN exposure was lower and less variable in ages greater than 19 days old.</abstract>

    <abstract>A simple and convenient method for the cryopreservation of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka) sperm was tested in the present study. The highest motility (76.7±2.9%) of post-thawing sperm was obtained in 15% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) with a 1:9 dilution (semen volume to DMSO volume) when 0.5 mL semen-DMSO mixture was frozen at 6 cm above liquid N2 in a closed styrofoam box. After thawing, sperm cryopreserved in glycerol almost lost motility entirely. Although there was no significant difference in percentage of motile sperm between 15% and 20% DMSO, the duration of sperm motility of 15% DMSO group was longer than that of 20% DMSO group. The motility of post-thawing sperm enhanced when the dilution ratio of semen increased from 1:1 to 1:9. Morphological changes such as the loss of mitochondria, swollen plasma membrane and broken or rolled-up tails were observed in post-thawing sperm using an eosin-nigrosin staining. The fertility of cryopreserved sperm was significantly lower than that of unfrozen sperm. The 10-fold increase in sperm to egg ratio resulted in double fertility for cryopreserved sperm, and about 70% fertility relative to the control.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of dietary probiotic Biogen® supplementation as a growth promoter on growth performance and feed utilization of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.)</title>
    <abstract>Probiotic microbial feed supplements are gaining wide acceptance in livestock production, and may be applicable to aquaculture production systems. The present study was conducted to examine probiotic treatment in the fingerling diet of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.). A total of 240 of Nile tilapia fingerlings (weight ranged from 22.96 to 26.40 g) were divided into five experimental groups. The experiment was conducted for 120 days. Experimental diets were identical in all, except for the variation in probiotic levels. A probiotic (Biogen®) was used at 0% (diet 1), 0.5% (diet 2), 1.5% (diet 3), 2.0% (diet 4) and 2.5% (diet 5) inclusion rates in the experimental diets. The growth performance and nutrient utilization of Nile tilapia including weight gain, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, protein productive value and energy retention were significantly (P<=0.01) higher in the treatment receiving probiotic (Biogen®) than the control diet. No differences were observed for moisture, ash and protein content (P<=0.01) among the experimental diets. The lowest gross energy and lipid contents were recorded for fish fed the diet containing 0.5% Biogen® (P<=0.01). The production performance and subsequent cost-benefit analyses clearly indicated that the diets containing probiotic biogen recorded the highest net return and the lowest total cost compared with the control diet.</abstract>

    <title>Growth- and breed-related changes of muscle bundle structure in cattle.</title>
    <abstract>The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in muscle fiber bundles of cattle of different breeds during growth. Different numbers of muscle fibers are surrounded by connective tissue to form bundles macroscopically visible as meat fibers or meat grain, a common meat quality trait. To determine the influence of breed and age on morphological characteristics of muscle fiber bundles, 4 cattle breeds with different growth impetus and muscularity were reared and slaughtered under experimental conditions. German Angus, a typical beef cattle; Galloway, a smaller beef type; Holstein Friesian, a dairy type; and double-muscled Belgian Blue, an extreme type for muscle growth, were used. Between 5 and 15 bulls of each breed were slaughtered at 2, 4, 6, 12, or 24 mo of age, and slices of semitendinosus muscle were removed. Muscle structure characteristics were determined by computerized image analysis. During growth, the muscle cross-sectional area enlarged (P < 0.001) about 5-fold in double-muscled Belgian Blue bulls and about 4-fold in the other breeds. This was a result of the enlargement (P < 0.001) of primary bundles and muscle fibers. The bundle size was similar (P >= 0.15) in bulls of German Angus and Galloway in all age groups and was doubled (P < 0.001) in double-muscled Belgian Blue animals from 4 mo of age on. The Holstein Friesian bulls had the smallest (P < 0.001) muscle fiber bundles at 24 mo of age. The number of muscle fibers per bundle and the number of bundles per muscle remained nearly constant (P > 0.05) during growth. This supports the existing view that the structure of the muscle is already fixed in prenatal life. The double-muscled Belgian Blue bulls showed a more than 2.5-fold greater (P < 0.001) number of muscle fibers per primary bundle compared with the other breeds investigated. The larger muscle fiber bundles led to a smaller amount of connective tissue per muscle area in double-muscled cattle. The coarser grain of meat in double-muscled Belgian Blue bulls and in older animals was not related to greater shear force values.</abstract>

    <abstract>Different sources of DHA and/or n-3 (omega-3) rich oils, oil emulsions and microencapsulated (ME) powders were tested at two different concentrations with the aim of producing fortified pan bread. Three oils (S-algae, fish and flax), two emulsified algae oils (Emulsion-P and Emulsion-L) and two ME oils (ME-S algae and ME-C algae) were compared. The DHA and n-3 oils replaced part of the shortening in order to obtain 32 g slices enriched with 25 or 50 mg DHA, 35 or 70 mg total n-3 from fish oil and 90 or 180 mg linolenic from flax oil. Addition of oils did not significantly affect water absorption but reduced mix time whereas addition of the ME oils decreased both water absorption and mix time. Breads enriched with flax or ME-C oils had lower volume and higher density than the control, ME-S algae, Emulsion-P and Emulsion-L breads. All breads lost texture throughout 14 d storage, the major changes occurred after 3 d. The ME-S algae oil bread had the best softness after 14 d storage whereas breads produced from ME-S algae or ME-C algae oils had the poorest texture. Sensory evaluations indicated that the color of the ME-S algae oil fortified bread was significantly less preferred than the other loaves. After 6 d the control bread had higher acceptability compared with the rest of the breads enriched with high levels of DHA or omega-3 oils. The high-enriched fish oil bread was well accepted during the first days of storage but had the least preferred acceptability after 13 d. The best fortified breads were those supplemented with S-algae oil, Emulsion-P and Emulsion-L oils.</abstract>

    <title>Agroinfection-based high-throughput screening reveals specific recognition of INF elicitins in Solanum</title>
    <abstract>We adapted and optimized the use of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens binary PVX expression system (PVX agroinfection) to screen Solanum plants for response to pathogen elicitors and applied the assay to identify a total of 11 clones of Solanum huancabambense and Solanum microdontum, out of 31 species tested, that respond to the elicitins INF1, INF2A and INF2B of Phytophthora infestans. Prior to this study, response to INF elicitins was only known in Nicotiana spp. within the Solanaceae. The identified S. huancabambense and S. microdontum clones also exhibited hypersensitivity-like cell death following infiltration with purified recombinant INF1, INF2A and INF2B, thereby validating the screening protocol. Comparison of INF elicitin activity revealed that Nicotiana plants responded to significantly lower concentrations than Solanum, suggesting variable levels of sensitivity to INF elicitins. We exploited natural variation in response to INF elicitins in the identified Solanum accessions to evaluate the relationship between INF recognition and late blight resistance. Interestingly, several INF-responsive Solanum plants were susceptible to P. infestans. Also, an S. microdontum xSolanum tuberosum (potato) population that segregates for INF response was generated but failed to identify a measurable contribution of INF response to resistance. These results suggest that in Solanum, INF elicitins are recognized as general elicitors and do not have a measurable contribution to disease resistance.</abstract>

    <title>Hop stunt viroid is processed and translocated in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants</title>
    <abstract>Viroids are small, single-stranded, circular, pathogenic RNAs that do not code for proteins and thus depend on host factors for their replication and movement. They induce diseases in plants by direct interaction with host factors through a mechanism as yet unidentified. Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) has been found in a wide range of herbaceous and woody hosts. Nicotiana benthamiana is one of the most frequently used experimental systems in the study of plant-virus interactions. However, this plant is a non-host for HSVd. To go further in the study of the requirements of a plant to be a host for viroids N. benthamiana was transformed with cDNA expressing dimeric (+) HSVd. Correct processing to the circular (+) monomers was always observed, demonstrating that N. benthamiana has the appropriate machinery to cleave and circularize (+) HSVd molecules. Additionally, N. benthamiana plants agroinoculated with the dimeric (-) HSVd accumulated the circular and linear (+) monomers, indicating that (-) HSVd transcripts can be used as template for the RNA-RNA transcription. Grafting assays showed that HSVd is able to move to distal plant parts. In addition, alterations in the normal flower development were observed. Taken together, these results indicate that deficiencies in the interaction with host factors related either to the early steps of the replication process or to cell to cell movement appear to be the factors that limit infectivity of HSVd in N. benthamiana. These transgenic plants can be an useful tool to study the HSVd-host factor interactions.</abstract>

    <title>Extensin over-expression in Arabidopsis limits pathogen invasiveness</title>
    <abstract>The function of the cell wall protein extensin has been the subject of much speculation since it was first isolated over 40 years ago. In order to investigate the role of extensins in plant defence, we used the gain-of-function strategy to generate transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing the EXT1 extensin gene. These were infected with the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 and symptom development was monitored. Lesions on the transgenics were on average five-fold smaller than those on the wild-type, did not increase in area over the time period of infection, accumulated a small bacterial load and showed very little chlorosis outside the lesion boundary. By contrast, lesions on the wild-type were large, spread to over 50% of the leaf area, continued to increase in size over the time course of the infection, accumulated a bacterial load 100-fold higher than that found in the transgenics, and showed a large chlorotic area outside the lesion boundary. SEM of lesions showed no evidence of bacteria at the lesion boundary in the extensin-over-expressing transgenics, whereas bacteria were always seen at the lesion boundary on the wild-type. Analysis of transgenics carrying an EXT1-GUS promoter-reporter fusion showed expression of GUS in a ring around the boundary of the lesion. Basal defences and signal transduction pathways involved in plant defence were not perturbed in the transgenics, as shown by the analysis of the expression of PR1 and PDF1.2 genes. These results show that extensin over-expression limits pathogen invasiveness.</abstract>

    <title>Net changes of main ions in the soil profile of irrigated field plots in central Spain</title>
    <abstract>Implementation of improved irrigation schedules in some semiarid zones improve water efficiency and can be recommended where occasional periods of heavy rainfall may remove some of the accumulated salts. We hypothesized, however, that the leaching pattern of the main ions may differ regarding their potential contribution to the total salt discharge. The experiment was conducted near Madrid in Spain on a typical Xerofluvent soil with sandy-loam texture in the first 0.5 m. For 4 years, a traditional crop rotation of corn-wheat-corn-oat (Zea mays L.-Triticum aestivum L.-Zea mays L.-Avena sativa L.) was planted and two irrigation treatments (traditional and improved) were applied only to the corn. In an experimental set-up of 24 plots, samples of the soil solutions were extracted 61 times during the experiment at soil depths of 0.4, 0.9 and 1.4 m. During the experiment, drainage volume was estimated in plots under the two irrigation schedules. Main ions in the soil solution were SO ₄ ²- , Cl-, Ca²⁺, Na⁺ and HCO ₃ - . These solutes accounted for 88% of total salt discharge under the two irrigation treatments. Two main patterns of salt leaching were observed. For most main ions, except HCO ₃ - , the input to discharge ratio was lower than one. Also for HCO ₃ - , the irrigation treatment did not affect the leaching pattern (higher input than discharge under the two irrigation treatments). Improved irrigation schedules can be implemented without increasing the total salt load, but attention should be paid to specific leaching patterns of individual ions.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of water salinity on growth and physiological stages of eight Canola (Brassica napus) cultivars</title>
    <abstract>Laboratory/greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of salinity levels ranging from 1 to 12 dS/m on germination rate, 8 leaf seedling dry matter, seed yield, and seed oil content of the 8 Canola (Brassica napus) cultivars: ACSN1, Falcon, Shirali, Ceres, Tower, Cobra, Global, and Oyerka. Statistical results revealed that the factors: salinity, cultivar, and their interaction had significant (P<0.01) effect on germination rate and 8 leaf seedling dry matter. Based on statistical analysis seed yield was significantly influenced by both salinity and cultivar at the 5% significance level; while the cultivar factor had a significant effect on seed oil content, salinity did not show any effect on seed oil content. Analytical results, using the well-known sigmoid or S-shape salinity response function gave reliable results for determining tolerant and sensitive cultivars to salinity. Applying an existing model on canola response to salinity levels in different growth stages, the values of C ₅₀ and P parameters were developed for local canola cultivars. Results showed that the response of cultivars to salinity levels vary in different growth stages. While a cultivar is tolerant in a growth stage, it may be sensitive to salinity in another growth stage. Based on observed data and ANOVA analysis, we concluded that ACSN1, Shiraly, and Falcon can be ranked as salt-tolerant, and Global and Oyerka as the salt-sensitive cultivars.</abstract>

    <title>Variable upper and lower crop water stress index baselines for corn and soybean</title>
    <abstract>Upper and lower crop water stress index (CWSI) baselines adaptable to different environments and times of day are needed to facilitate irrigation scheduling with infrared thermometers. The objective of this study was to develop dynamic upper and lower CWSI baselines for corn and soybean. Ten-minute averages of canopy temperatures from corn and soybean plots at four levels of soil water depletion were measured at North Platte, Nebraska, during the 2004 growing season. Other variables such as solar radiation (R s), air temperature (T a), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (u), and plant canopy height (h) were also measured. Daily soil water depletions from the research plots were estimated using a soil water balance approach with a computer model that used soil, crop, weather, and irrigation data as input. Using this information, empirical equations to estimate the upper and lower CWSI baselines were developed for both crops. The lower baselines for both crops were functions of h, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), R s, and u. The upper baselines did not depend on VPD, but were a function of R s and u for soybean, and R s, h, and u for corn. By taking into account all the variables that significantly affected the baselines, it should be possible to apply them at different locations and times of day. The new baselines developed in this study should facilitate the application of the CWSI method as a practical tool for irrigation scheduling of corn and soybean.</abstract>

    <title>Real-time prediction of soil infiltration characteristics for the management of furrow irrigation</title>
    <abstract>The spatial and temporal variations commonly found in the infiltration characteristic for surface-irrigated fields are a major physical constraint to achieve higher irrigation application efficiencies. Substantial work has been directed towards developing methods to estimate the infiltration characteristics of soil from irrigation advance data. However, none of the existing methods are entirely suitable for use in real-time control. The greatest limitation is that they are data intensive. A new method that uses a model infiltration curve (MIC) is proposed. In this method a scaling process is used to reduce the amount of data required to predict the infiltration characteristics for each furrow and each irrigation event for a whole field. Data from 44 furrow irrigation events from two different fields were used to evaluate the proposed method. Infiltration characteristics calculated using the proposed method were compared to values calculated from the full advance data using the INFILT computer model. The infiltration curves calculated by the proposed method were of similar shape to the INFILT curves and gave similar values for cumulative infiltration up to the irrigation advance time for each furrow. More importantly the statistical properties of the two sets of infiltration characteristics were similar. This suggests that they would return equivalent estimates of irrigation performance for the two fields and that the proposed method could be suitable for use in real-time control.</abstract>

    <title>Impact of crop rotation and minimum tillage on water use efficiency of irrigated cotton in a Vertisol</title>
    <abstract>Crop water use efficiency of irrigated cotton was hypothesized to be improved by a combination of minimum tillage and sowing a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation crop. This hypothesis was evaluated in a Vertisol near Narrabri, Australia from 1997 to 2003. The experimental treatments were: continuous cotton sown after conventional or minimum tillage and minimum-tilled cotton-wheat. Soil water content was measured with a neutron moisture meter, and runoff with trapezoidal flumes. Application efficiency of irrigation water was estimated as the amount of infiltrated water/total amount applied. Plant available water was estimated using the maximum and minimum soil water storage during the growing season. Evapotranspiration was estimated with the water balance method using measured and simulated soil water data. Seasonal evapotranspiration was partitioned into that coming from rainfall, irrigation and stored soil water. Crop water use efficiency was calculated as cotton lint yield per hectare/seasonal evapotranspiration. Rotation of cotton with wheat and minimum tillage improved water use efficiency in some years and application efficiency in all years. Average seasonal evapotranspiration was higher with minimum tillage than with conventional tillage. In years when cotton was sown in all plots, average cotton crop water use efficiencies were 0.23, 0.23 and 0.22 kg (lint)/m³ for minimum-tilled cotton-wheat and continuous cotton, and conventionally tilled continuous cotton, respectively. In-season rainfall efficiency, transpiration and soil evaporation were unaffected by cropping system.</abstract>

    <title>Irrigation scheduling of plastic greenhouse vegetable crops based on historical weather data</title>
    <abstract>Irrigation scheduling based on the daily historical crop evapotranspiration (ETh) data was theoretically and experimentally assessed for the major soil-grown greenhouse horticultural crops on the Almería coast in order to improve irrigation efficiency. Overall, the simulated seasonal ETh values for different crop cycles from 41 greenhouses were not significantly different from the corresponding values of real-time crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Additionally, for the main greenhouse crops on the Almería coast, the simulated values of the maximum cumulative soil water deficit in each of the 15 consecutive growth cycles (1988-2002) were determined using simple soil-water balances comparing daily ETh and ETc values to schedule irrigation. In most cases, no soil-water deficits affecting greenhouse crop productivity were detected, but the few cases found led us to also assess experimentally the use of ETh for irrigation scheduling of greenhouse horticultural crops. The response of five greenhouse crops to water applications scheduled with daily estimates of ETh and ETc was evaluated in a typical enarenado soil. In tomato, fruit yield did not differ statistically between irrigation treatments, but the spring green bean irrigated using the ETh data presented lower yield than that irrigated using the ETc data. In the remaining experiments, the irrigation-management method based on ETh data was modified to consider the standard deviation of the inter-annual greenhouse reference ET. No differences between irrigation treatments were found for productivity of pepper, zucchini and melon crops.</abstract>

    <title>A new stochastic optimization model for deficit irrigation</title>
    <abstract>Deficit irrigation has been suggested as a way to increase system benefits, at the cost of individual benefits, by decreasing the crop water allocation and increasing the total irrigated land. Deterministic methods are common for determining optimal irrigation schedules with deficit irrigation because considering the inherent uncertainty in crop water demands while including the lower and upper bounds on soil moisture availability is a hard problem. To deal with this, a constraint state formulation for stochastic control of the weekly deficit irrigation strategy is proposed. This stochastic formulation is based on the first and second moment analysis of the stochastic soil moisture state variable, considering soil moisture as bounded between a maximum value and a minimum value. As a result, an optimal deficit irrigation scheduling is determined using this explicit stochastic model that does not require discretization of system variables. According to the results, if irrigation strategy is based on deterministic predictions, achievement of high, long-term expected relative net benefits by decreased crop water allocation and increased irrigated land may have a higher failure probability.</abstract>

    <title>A simulation study of comparison of the evaluation procedures for three irrigation methods</title>
    <abstract>Standard evaluation procedures, based on field measurements and statistical, hydraulic models, have been developed for assessing irrigation systems performance. However, given the diverse nature of the irrigation methods, it is not possible to use a unique evaluation procedure. Ideally, variables would be measured at every point throughout the field under study, but that is clearly impractical. Instead, measurements are taken of selected samples, or irrigation models are used to predict field-wide distributions of the variables. In this paper, irrigation models for trickle, sprinkler and furrow irrigation are used to assess how well the irrigation performance indicators generated by standard procedures match those generated by whole-field simulations. Six performance indicators were used: distribution uniformity, uniformity coefficient of Christiansen, application efficiency, deep percolation ratio, tail water ratio and requirement efficiency. The analysis was applied to systems typical of cotton crops in Southern Spain. The results show that the procedure used to determine performance indicators in trickle irrigation provides good estimates of the whole field performance. The procedure used in sprinkler irrigation is also acceptable, but yields variable results. Finally, the standard procedure used for furrow irrigation produces biased, highly variable results and overestimates distribution uniformity.</abstract>

    <title>Composition, Digestibility and Application in Breadmaking of Banana Flour</title>
    <abstract>Banana flour (BF) was obtained from unripe banana (Musa paradisiacal L.) and characterized in its chemical composition. Experimental bread was formulated with BF flour and the product was studied regarding chemical composition, available starch (AS), resistant starch (RS) and rate of starch digestion in vitro. The chemical composition of BF showed that total starch (73.36%) and dietary fiber (14.52%) were the highest constituents. Of the total starch, available starch was 56.29% and resistant starch 17.50%. BF bread had higher protein and total starch content than control bread, but the first had higher lipid amount. Appreciable differences were found in available, resistant starch and indigestible fraction between the bread studied, since BF bread showed higher resistant starch and indigestible fraction content. HI-based predicted glycemic index for the BF bread was 65.08%, which was significantly lower than control bread (81.88%), suggesting a “slow carbohydrate” feature for the BF-based goods. Results revealed BF as a potential ingredient for bakery products containing slowly digestible carbohydrates.</abstract>

    <title>Characterisation of T-DNA loci and vector backbone sequences in transgenic wheat produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation</title>
    <abstract>Detailed molecular characterisation of transgene loci is a requirement for gaining regulatory approval for environmental release of genetically modified crops. In cereals, it is generally accepted that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation generates cleaner transgene loci with lower copy number and fewer rearrangements than those generated by biolistics. However, in wheat there has been little detailed analysis of T-DNA insertions at genetic and molecular level. Wheat lines transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens with bar and gusA (GUS) genes were subjected to genetic and molecular analysis. Unlike previous studies of transgene loci in wheat, we used functional assays for PAT and GUS proteins, combined with PCR and Southern analysis to detect the presence, copy number, linkage and transmission of two transgenes inserted in the same T-DNA. Thirty-four independent transgenic lines were categorised into three types: type I events (38% of total) where the gusA and bar genes displayed complete genetic linkage, segregating together as a single functional locus at the expected ratio of 3:1; type II events (18%), which possessed two or more transgene loci each containing gusA and bar; and type III events (44%), containing an incomplete T-DNA in which either the gusA or bar gene was lost. Most lines in this last category had lost the bar gene situated near the left T-DNA border. Southern analysis indicated that 30% of all lines possessed a single T-DNA copy containing gusA and bar. However, when data on expression and molecular analysis are combined, only 23% of all lines have single copy T-DNAs in which both gene cassettes are functioning. We also report on the presence of plasmid backbone DNA sequence in transgene loci detected using primer pairs outside the left and right T-DNA borders and within the plasmid selectable marker (NptI) gene. Approximately two thirds of the lines contained some vector backbone DNA, more frequently adjacent to the left border. Taken together, these data imply unstable left border function causing premature T-strand termination or read-through into vector backbone. As far as we are aware, this is the first report revealing near border T-DNA truncation and vector backbone integration in wheat transgenic lines produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.</abstract>

    <title>Assessment of ribozyme-mediated gene suppression using a luciferase reporter gene containing the sequence of Chrysanthemum Stunt Viroid as a target</title>
    <abstract>Transgenic tobacco plants expressing hammerhead ribozyme (Rz), which specifically cleaves Chrysanthemum Stunt Viroid (CSVd) RNA, were produced via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. To analyze the effects of Rz in cells, fire-fly luciferase (Luc) reporter genes, driven by the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter, which have the entire sense or anti-sense cDNA of the CSVd genome in between the Luc ORF and nopalin synthase terminator were constructed. Using particle bombardment, the Luc reporter constructs were delivered into the leaves of the transgenic tobacco plants. Levels of Luc mRNA and Luc enzyme activity were lower in the transgenic plants than in control wild-type plants, suggesting that the transcript of the Luc reporter gene was made unstable in the presence of Rz. On the other hand, mutations at the cleavage sites of the CSVd sequence in the reporter constructs suppressed the reduction of Luc enzyme activity in transgenic plants. A possibility of post-transcriptional gene silencing was ruled out. A direct evidence of the cleavage activity in cells by the experiment of rapid amplification of 5' cDNA end could not obtained, but the present results suggest that the levels of Luc mRNA and Luc enzyme activity was affected by the ribozymes.</abstract>

    <title>Breeding high-stearic oilseed rape (Brassica napus) with high- and low-erucic background using optimised promoter-gene constructs</title>
    <abstract>Seed lipids of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) usually contain small proportions (<3%) of stearic acid. The objective of this study was to increase the content of stearic fatty acid in rapeseed oil. An antisense down-regulation of the endogenous stearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD) catalysing the reaction step from stearic to oleic acid in two different genetic backgrounds was studied. The result of down-regulation of the SAD yielded an about 10-fold increase of stearic acid from 3.7% up to 32% in single seeds of transgenic low-erucic acid rapeseed (LEAR), while high-erucic acid rapeseed (HEAR) showed a 4-fold increase of C18:0 from 1% up to 4%. It could be shown in pooled T2 seed material of LEAR rapeseed, that the stearic acid content is highly correlated with the down-regulation of SAD as indicated by the stearate desaturation proportion (SDP). The importance of the promoter strength for the alteration of a trait was confirmed in this study as no change in the fatty acid composition of transgenic plants was achieved with gene constructs controlled by the weak FatB4 seed-specific promoter from Cuphea lanceolata.</abstract>

    <title>A Comparison of Three Different Hydroponic Sub-systems (gravel bed, floating and nutrient film technique) in an Aquaponic Test System</title>
    <abstract>Murray Cod, Maccullochella peelii peelii (Mitchell), and Green Oak lettuce, Lactuca sativa, were used to test for differences between three hydroponic subsystems, Gravel Bed, Floating Raft and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), in a freshwater Aquaponic test system, where plant nutrients were supplied from fish wastes while plants stripped nutrients from the waste water before it was returned to the fish. The Murray Cod had FCR's and biomass gains that were statistically identical in all systems. Lettuce yields were good, and in terms of biomass gain and yield, followed the relationship Gravel bed > Floating > NFT, with significant differences seen between all treatments. The NFT treatment was significantly less efficient than the other two treatments in terms of nitrate removal (20% less efficient), whilst no significant difference was seen between any test treatments in terms of phosphate removal. In terms of dissolved oxygen, water replacement and conductivity, no significant differences were observed between any test treatments. Overall, results suggest that NFT hydroponic sub-systems are less efficient at both removing nutrients from fish culture water and producing plant biomass or yield than Gravel bed or Floating hydroponic sub-systems in an Aquaponic context. Aquaponic system designers need to take these differences into account when designing hydroponic components within aquaponic systems.</abstract>

    <abstract>The effects of benzocaine anesthesia on hematological parameters (erythrocyte and platelet number, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit), plasma electrolytes (Na⁺, K⁺ and Cl-), cortisol, glucose and cholesterol levels in Brazilian codling (Urophycis brasilensis) exposed to a benzocaine bath solution were investigated. Cortisol and glucose levels 1 h after capture from the wild and on days 7 and 14 during the acclimatization period (20 days) were also determined. During the second week, cortisol levels reached to basal values (9 ng ml-¹). The use of benzocaine causes a significant increase in the erythrocyte number, in the concentration of hemoglobin and sodium and a decrease in chloride. Plasma cortisol and cholesterol levels were higher in fish exposed to the anesthetic, and glucose levels decreased significantly comparing with the control group, showing strong fluctuations between individuals in all the cases. These results show that the use of benzocaine causes an acute stress response that could be reverted quickly and it has to be considered during the evaluation of stress in fish.</abstract>

    <abstract>To compare the growth performance of koi carp, Cyprinus carpio var. koi, produced in concrete tanks (2.13 x 0.91 x 1.22 m; capacity: 2,000 l each) and earthen ponds (9.1 x 6.10 x 1.07 m; capacity: 59650 l each), fish larvae (stocking size: 0.12 ± 0.008 g) were cultured for 11 weeks and individual weight gain, survival rate and number of marketable fish produced were compared among four management regimes for each culture system: (1) live zooplankton fed to fish larvae in ponds (PLF) and tanks (TLF); (2) application of poultry manure in ponds (PPM) and tanks (TPM); (3) application of cow manure in ponds (PCD) and tanks (TCD); and (4) a control treatment for ponds (PC) and tanks (TC), where a commercial feed was applied. There were three replicates for each treatment. Weight gain of koi carp was highest in the PLF treatment, followed in decreasing order by TLF, PPM, PCD, TPM, TCD, PC and TC treatments (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference in the survival of koi carp among the treatments, ranging from 67.83% in TC to 95.50% in PLF. The number of marketable fish produced was highest in the PLF treatment, followed in decreasing order by TLF, PPM and PCD treatments. However, none of the fish produced in the TPM, TCD, PC and TC treatments attained marketable size. Significantly higher (P < 0.05) values of pH and dissolved oxygen (for water samples collected weekly at 9 A.M.) were obtained in the live food and control treatments (for both tanks and ponds), compared to the manured treatments. The concentration of total alkalinity, BOD, PO₄-P, NO₃-N and specific conductivity were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in PPM and PCD, compared to other treatments. NO₂-N and NH₄-N values were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in TPM and TCD, than other treatments. The results suggest that introduction of live zooplankton into culture units result in higher growth of koi carp larvae compared to manure based systems. Earthen ponds appeared to be better alternative to concrete tanks for manure application through maintenance of better water quality due to their higher assimilatory capacity and greater abundance of plankton which resulted in better growth of cultured fish.</abstract>

    <title>Functional analysis of starch-synthesis genes in determining rice eating and cooking qualities</title>
    <abstract>Apparent amylose content (AAC), gel consistency (GC), and gelatinization temperature (GT) are recognized as the most important determinants of rice eating and cooking qualities. The contributions of major starch-synthesis genes to these three traits have been investigated in the three consecutive experiments. In an initial QTL mapping with 130 doubled haploid (DH) lines, derived from an inter-subspecific cross of 'Nanjing11'/'Balilla', the major QTLs responsible for AAC, GC, and GT coincided with the Wx (granule-bound starch synthase gene), Wx, and Sss IIa (soluble starch synthase gene) loci, respectively. In the second experiment, contributions of the major starch-synthesis genes to AAC, GC, and GT variations were estimated by using a multiple linear regression analysis. As shown, the Wx locus was a principal determinant for both AAC and GC, and could account for 58.5% and 38.9% of the phenotypic variations, respectively; while the Sss IIa locus was associated with GT, and could explain 25.5% of the observed variation. Eventually, a F₂ population consisting of 501 individuals, derived from an inter-subspecific cross of the two sticky rice varieties 'Suyunuo' and 'Yangfunuo 4', was examined with gene-tagged markers. In the absence of the Wx gene, none of the starch-synthesis genes investigated could dominate the GC variation, however, the Sss IIa locus could also explain 25.1% of the GT variation. In summary, the Wx locus dominates the AAC variation, and meanwhile plays a major role in the GC variation. The Sss IIa locus is a major factor in explaining the GT variation. Apart from the major genes, other genetic factors may also contribute to the GC/GT variations.</abstract>

    <title>Distribution of β-amylase I haplotypes among European cultivated barleys</title>
    <abstract>The barley β-amylase I (Bmy1) locus encodes a starch breakdown enzyme whose kinetic properties and thermostability are critical during malt production. Studies of allelic variation at the Bmy1 locus have shown that the encoded enzyme can be commonly found in at least three distinct thermostability classes and demonstrated the nucleotide sequence variations responsible for such phenotypic differences. In order to explore the extent of sequence diversity at the Bmy1 locus in cultivated European barley, 464 varieties representing a cross-section of popular varieties grown in western Europe over the past 60 years, were genotyped for three single nucleotide polymorphisms chosen to tag the four common alleles found in the collection. One of these haplotypes, which has not been explicitly recognised in the literature as a distinct allele, was found in 95% of winter varieties in the sample. When release dates of the varieties were considered, the lowest thermostability allele (Bmy1-Sd2L) appeared to decrease in abundance over time, while the highest thermostability allele (Bmy1-Sd2H) was the rarest allele at 5.4% of the sample and was virtually confined to two-row spring varieties. Pedigree analysis was used to track transmission of particular alleles over time and highlighted issues of genetic stratification of the sample.</abstract>

    <abstract>Copepods have a number of advantages for use as live food in cultures of fish and crustacean larvae. This study aimed to develop culture techniques of Tisbe biminiensis Volkmann-Rocco 1973 in volumes of 500 mL. The first experiment tested the effect of salinity on survival and fecundity. The other experiments studied the population growth comparing two levels of daily ration and the effect of sand sediment in cultures. The cultures were carried out on plastic boxes at 29°C, salinity of 34 g L⁻¹ and 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod with aerated filtered seawater, total renewal every other day. Adult females tolerated the decrease of salinity from 34 to 27 g L⁻¹ but the offspring production decreased significantly. The salinity of 20 g L⁻¹ was not tolerated at all. Tisbe biminiensis attained one of the highest rates of increase in cultures among harpacticoids (0.33 day⁻¹) and a high density of 205 individual ind. mL⁻¹. The carrying capacity of the population was estimated as 67 200 ind. in 500 mL recipients. In conclusion, T. biminiensis grow fast and attain high densities in cultures of 500 mL volume without sediment, feeding a daily ration of 50-100% of copepodite biomass.</abstract>

    <abstract>Two representative Italian emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) landraces, two selected lines and three improved emmer wheat cultivars, derived from crosses with durum wheat (Molisano landrace x 'Simeto'), were tested for their susceptibility to Tilletia indica, the cause of Karnal bunt of wheat. Plants of emmer wheat were inoculated by injecting allantoid sporidial suspensions into the boot cavity of plants, just prior to ear emergence. A highly susceptible Indian spring wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum) was used as a comparative control. At maturity of the plants, the seeds were harvested and assessed for incidence and severity of disease. All emmer wheat genotypes tested were infected but showed differing levels of susceptibility. The percentage of infected seeds for individual genotypes ranged from 5.4 to 75.0% compared with 99.1% for WL-711. The severity of infection was less in the old landraces, but it was higher in all the improved emmer wheat cultivars. In conclusion, Italian cultivars of emmer wheat were found to be highly susceptible to T. indica, and are potentially able to support the establishment of the pathogen.</abstract>

    <title>Incidence and distribution of Heterobasidion and Armillaria and their influence on canopy gap formation in unmanaged mountain pine forests in the Swiss Alps</title>
    <abstract>Various disturbance factors on different spatial scales can lead to the creation of canopy gaps in forest ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the role of root rot fungi in the formation of canopy gaps in the Swiss National Park in the Central Alps. Dying or recently dead mountain pine (Pinus mugo subsp. uncinata trees (n = 172) and saplings (n = 192) from 42 canopy gaps were assessed for Armillaria and Annosum root rot. Heterobasidion annosum s.str. proved to be the dominant pathogen and was isolated from 49% of the trees and 64% of the saplings. Armillaria was found on 13% of the trees and 20% of the saplings. Three Armillaria species, A. borealis, A. cepistipes, and A. ostoyae, were identified. Armillaria ostoyae was the most frequent species, accounting for 72% of all Armillaria isolates. A total of 31 (74%) gaps were associated with H. annosum, and six (14%) with A. ostoyae. The remaining gaps were either associated with both pathogens (7%) or with other, unknown, factors (5%). Our findings suggest that the two pathogenic fungi, H. annosum s.str. and A. ostoyae, are the main reason for the large-scale mortality of mountain pines and the creation of canopy gaps in high elevation forests of the Swiss National Park.</abstract>

    <title>Characterization of a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Gene from Cucumber Required for Trichoderma-Conferred Plant Resistance</title>
    <abstract>The fungal biocontrol agent Trichoderma asperellum has been recently shown to induce systemic resistance in plants through a mechanism that employs jasmonic acid and ethylene signal transduction pathways. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins have been implicated in the signal transduction of a wide variety of plant stress responses. Here we report the identification and characterization of a Trichoderma-induced MAPK (TIPK) gene function in cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Similar to its homologs, wound-induced protein kinase, MPK3, and MPK3a, TIPK is also induced by wounding. Normally, preinoculation of roots with Trichoderma activates plant defense mechanisms, which result in resistance to the leaf pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv lachrymans. We used a unique attenuated virus vector, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV-AGII), to overexpress TIPK protein and antisense (AS) RNA. Plants overexpressing TIPK were more resistant to pathogenic bacterial attack than control plants, even in the absence of Trichoderma preinoculation. On the other hand, plants expressing TIPK-AS revealed increased sensitivity to pathogen attack. Moreover, Trichoderma preinoculation could not protect these AS plants against subsequent pathogen attack. We therefore demonstrate that Trichoderma exerts its protective effect on plants through activation of the TIPK gene, a MAPK that is involved in signal transduction pathways of defense responses.</abstract>

    <title>Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase (CmCCD4a) Contributes to White Color Formation in Chrysanthemum Petals</title>
    <abstract>The white petals of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) are believed to contain a factor that inhibits the accumulation of carotenoids. To find this factor, we performed polymerase chain reaction-Select subtraction screening and obtained a clone expressed differentially in white and yellow petals. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein (designated CmCCD4a) encoded by the clone was highly homologous to the sequence of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase. All the white-flowered chrysanthemum cultivars tested showed high levels of CmCCD4a transcript in their petals, whereas most of the yellow-flowered cultivars showed extremely low levels. Expression of CmCCD4a was strictly limited to flower petals and was not detected in other organs, such as the root, stem, or leaf. White petals turned yellow after the RNAi construct of CmCCD4a was introduced. These results indicate that in white petals of chrysanthemums, carotenoids are synthesized but are subsequently degraded into colorless compounds, which results in the white color.</abstract>

    <title>Development of SCAR markers for identification of stem rust resistance gene Sr31 in the homozygous or heterozygous condition in bread wheat</title>
    <abstract>The stem rust resistance gene Sr31, transferred from rye (Secale cereale) into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) imparts resistance to all the virulent pathotypes of stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) found in India. Wheat genotypes including carriers and non-carriers of the Sr31 gene were analysed using arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR). AP-PCR markers viz. SS30.2₅₈₀₍H₎ associated with the Sr31 gene and SS26.1₁₁₀₀ associated with the allele for susceptibility were identified. Linkage between the markers and phenotypes was confirmed by analysing an F₂ population obtained from a cross between a resistant and a susceptible genotype. The markers were tightly linked to the respective alleles. Both the AP-PCR markers were converted into sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, viz. SCSS30.2₅₇₆ and SCSS26.1₁₁₀₀ respectively. The markers were validated in two more segregating populations and 49 wheat genotypes. Using both markers it was possible to distinguish the homozygous from the heterozygous carriers of the Sr31 gene in the F₂ generation. The markers developed in this study can be used for pyramiding of the Sr31 gene with other rust resistance genes and in marker-assisted selection.</abstract>

    <title>Genetic diversity among parental lines of Indica hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.) in China based on coefficient of parentage</title>
    <abstract>Genetic diversity constitutes the raw material for plant improvement, and provides protection against genetic vulnerability to biotic and abiotic stresses. Diversity of parental lines of indica hybrid rice in China is not well-characterized. The major objective of this study was to quantify genetic diversity of Chinese parental lines of hybrid rice via coefficient of parentage (COP). All 100 parental lines of hybrid rice widely used in hybrid breeding and commercial production during 1976-2003 were studied by COP analysis. The mean COP for the 100 parental lines was low (0.056), indicating a potentially high degree of diversity in Chinese hybrid rice breeding. Forty-nine percent of all pairs of parental lines were completely unrelated by pedigree data. The low mean COP for the parental lines was attributed to a continual incorporation of exotic germplasm (wild rice, japonica and javanica etc.) into the genetic base over time, to the introduction of foreign germplasm from the Philippines (International Rice Research Institute), Korea, the United States, Thailand, and Guyana as breeding stock. The mean COP from 1976 to 1990 was twice as much as that from 1990 to 2003. Cluster analysis was an effective method to discriminate diversity, ten clusters were identified, and maintainer lines, restorer lines and other parental lines with special genetic background were clearly grouped. In addition, restorer lines were further divided into 11 sub-clusters, which basically was in agreement with hybrid rice breeding. Among ten provinces, Hunan, Sichuan and Fujian were outstanding for breeding 54 of 100 parental lines in hybrid rice production, and the genetic diversity of parental lines in Fujian, Sichuan,Guangxi, Hunan and Jiangsu were all narrower than that in Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangxi. The result of coefficient of parentage analysis for 100 parental lines may promote the management of parental diversity and hybrid rice breeding in China.</abstract>

    <title>Androgenetic plants of Anemone coronaria derived through anther culture</title>
    <abstract>The genus Anemone (Ranunculaceae) includes many species cultivated for ornamental purposes. Most cut flower cultivars belong to A. coronaria L. and are multiplied by seed and sold for cultivation as 1-year-old tubers. As cultivars represent a population of hybrid individuals derived from crosses between heterozygous parents, the use of a true F₁ hybrid would improve the uniformity and quality of the product. As a first step towards the development of pure-breeding lines, anther cultures were established from elite cultivars of A. coronaria. Somatic embryos and plantlets were regenerated from five elite cultivars, and up to 16.9 regenerants per 100 cultured anthers were obtained. Cytological analysis identified that 11 of 19 regenerants had either a 2x = 16 karyotype, or were mixoploids. RAPD-based DNA fingerprinting showed that all the regenerants tested differed genetically from their anther donor, confirming their androgenetic origin. The shortening to 15 months for the time required to produce homozygous lines may convince seed companies to invest in F₁ hybrid breeding.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing alternative approaches to predicting soil phosphorus sorption</title>
    <abstract>Twenty-five pasture soils were sampled from high-rainfall zones of southeastern Australia to examine relationships between soil properties, and between soil properties and P buffering capacity (PBC) measures. Correlations between PBC values and soil properties were generally poor, with the exception of oxalate-extractable Al (Alox) (r >= 0.97). Predictions of PBC were further improved when clay, as well as Alox, was included in a linear regression model (r² >= 0.98). When Alox and oxalate-extractable Fe were excluded from the modelling exercise, a more complex three-term linear regression model, including pHH₂O, exchangeable H and cation exchange capacity, adequately fitted both PBC values of the 25 soils examined in this study (r² >= 0.76). However, the Alox, Alox plus clay and the three-term models gave poor predictions of the PBC values when the models were validated using 28 independent soils. These results emphasize the importance of model validation, because predictive models based on soil properties were not robust when tested across a broader range of soil types. In comparison, direct measures of PBC, such as single-point P sorption measures, are more practical and robust methods of estimating PBC for Australian soils.</abstract>

    <title>Development of embryos in Mastacembelus mastacembelus (Bank & Solender, 1794) (Mesopotamian spiny eel) (Mastacembelidae)</title>
    <abstract>In this study, the embryonic development of the eggs in the Mastacembelus mastacembelus (Bank & Solender, 1794) was examined. At the same time, possibilities of artificial breeding through artificial insemination were investigated. Artificial insemination was achieved by mixing the eggs of the mature female and sperm of the mature male samples caught with gill nets (22 x 22) in Ataturk Dam Lake in Turkey. To this end, first in a Petri dish (100 x 20), the testes were cut into small pieces with a lancet and the mixture of sperm-testes-tissue was obtained. The fertilization rate of the eggs was found to be 80%. The diameter of the eggs ranged from 2.015to 1.147 mm. The perivitelline space formed 0.5 h after insemination. The first cleavage occurred at the animal pool 4 h after insemination. The oil droplets had fused to a single droplet 19 h after insemination. The blastoderm became an embryonic shield 30 h after insemination. The blastoderm covered almost half the egg 40 h after insemination and embryonic body was formed. The blastoderm covered almost the whole egg 50 h after insemination. Some somites were discernible 59 h after insemination. The embryonic body reached two-third of the circumference of the egg 70 h after insemination. The tail bud began to separate from the yolk 77 h after insemination. A newly hatched larva was observed at 85 h after insemination.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of Artemia enrichment on the growth and survival of Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis (Temminck & Schlegel) larvae</title>
    <abstract>This study was carried out to investigate the suitability of Artemia enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and choline as live food on the growth and survival rate of the Pacific bluefin tuna (PBT; Thunnus orientalis) larvae. The PBT larvae were fed either Artemia enriched with oleic acid (Diet 1), DHA (Diet 2), DHA+choline 1.0 mg L⁻¹ (Diet 3) and DHA+choline 2.0 mg L⁻¹ (Diet 4) or striped knifejaw larvae (Diet 5, reference diet), in duplicate for 12 days. Enrichment of Artemia with DHA significantly increased the DHA levels to 13.9, 13.8 and 12.5 mg g⁻¹ on a dry matter basis in Diets 2, 3 and 4 respectively; however, the levels were significantly lower than the reference diet (26.9 mg g⁻¹ dry matter basis; Diet 5). Although growth and survival rate were significantly improved by the enrichment of Artemia with DHA and choline, the improvement was negligible compared with the enhanced growth and survival rate of the fish larvae-fed group (P<0.05). The results demonstrated that enriched Artemia does not seem to be the right choice to feed the PBT larvae perhaps because of the difficulties in achieving the correct balance of fatty acid with higher DHA/EPA from Artemia nauplii.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of Antarctic krillmeal on quality of farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.)</title>
    <abstract>Farmed Atlantic cod with a mean weight of 4.8 kg were maintained for 9 weeks in sea cages and fed diets where the dietary fishmeal component was substituted with increasing proportions (0%, 22%, 63% and 100%) of meal from Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Wild-caught cod were included in the study as external control. At termination of feeding, all fish were slaughtered and muscle pH was immediately recorded. The fish were then stored on ice for three days and assessed for muscle pH and objective (skin and fillet colour, and fillet texture) and subjective (sensory evaluation) quality criteria. Replacement of fishmeal with krillmeal in the diets resulted in the skin colour above and below the lateral line to be more red than the control group without krillmeal substitutions, even though this difference was not significant, and with more yellow hue. Additions of krillmeal increased the muscle whiteness and yellow hue compared with the control group and wild fish. There was no difference in red hue between the groups. Muscle pH, texture or sensory attributes were unaffected by dietary inclusion level of krillmeal. Wild-caught cod deviated in several aspects from the farmed cod. It is concluded that the replacement of fishmeal with Antarctic krillmeal in the diets two months before slaughter did not move the sensory attributes more towards wild fish.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of Management on Carbon Sequestration in Forest Biomass in Southeast Alaska</title>
    <abstract>The Tongass National Forest (Tongass) is the largest national forest and largest area of old-growth forest in the United States. Spatial geographic information system data for the Tongass were combined with forest inventory data to estimate and map total carbon stock in the Tongass; the result was 2.8 ± 0.5 Pg C, or 8% of the total carbon in the forests of the conterminous USA and 0.25% of the carbon in global forest vegetation and soils. Cumulative net carbon loss from the Tongass due to management of the forest for the period 1900-95 was estimated at 6.4-17.2 Tg C. Using our spatially explicit data for carbon stock and net flux, we modeled the potential effect of five management regimes on future net carbon flux. Estimates of net carbon flux were sensitive to projections of the rate of carbon accumulation in second-growth forests and to the amount of carbon left in standing biomass after harvest. Projections of net carbon flux in the Tongass range from 0.33 Tg C annual sequestration to 2.3 Tg C annual emission for the period 1995-2095. For the period 1995-2195, net flux estimates range from 0.19 Tg C annual sequestration to 1.6 Tg C annual emission. If all timber harvesting in the Tongass were halted from 1995 to 2095, the economic value of the net carbon sequestered during the 100-year hiatus, assuming $20/Mg C, would be $4 to $7 million/y (1995 US dollars). If a prohibition on logging were extended to 2195, the annual economic value of the carbon sequestered would be largely unaffected ($3 to $6 million/y). The potential annual economic value of carbon sequestration with management maximizing carbon storage in the Tongass is comparable to revenue from annual timber sales historically authorized for the forest.</abstract>

    <title>Interactive Effects of Fire, Elevated Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen Deposition, and precipitation on a California Annual Grassland</title>
    <abstract>Although it is widely accepted that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrogen (N) deposition, and climate change will alter ecosystem productivity and function in the coming decades, the combined effects of these environmental changes may be nonadditive, and their interactions may be altered by disturbances, such as fire. We examined the influence of a summer wildfire on the interactive effects of elevated CO₂, N deposition, and increased precipitation in a full-factorial experiment conducted in a California annual grassland. In unburned plots, primary production was suppressed under elevated CO₂. Burning alone did not significantly affect production, but it increased total production in combination with nitrate additions and removed the suppressive effect of elevated CO₂. Increased production in response to nitrate in burned plots occurred as a result of the enhanced aboveground production of annual grasses and forbs, whereas the removal of the suppressive effect of elevated CO₂ occurred as a result of increased aboveground forb production in burned, CO₂-treated plots and decreased root production in burned plots under ambient CO₂.The tissue nitrogen-phosphorus ratio, which was assessed for annual grass shoots, decreased with burning and increased with nitrate addition. Burning removed surface litter from plots, resulting in an increase in maximum daily soil temperatures and a decrease in soil moisture both early and late in the growing season. Measures of vegetation greenness, based on canopy spectral reflectance, showed that plants in burned plots grew rapidly early in the season but senesced early. Overall, these results indicate that fire can alter the effects of elevated CO₂ and N addition on productivity in the short term, possibly by promoting increased phosphorus availability.</abstract>

    <title>Iron Constraints on Planktonic Primary Production in Oligotrophic Lakes</title>
    <abstract>Phototrophic primary production is a fundamental ecosystem process, and it is ultimately constrained by access to limiting nutrients. Whereas most research on nutrient limitation of lacustrine phytoplankton has focused on phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) limitation, there is growing evidence that iron (Fe) limitation may be more common than previously acknowledged. Here we show that P was the nutrient that stimulated phytoplankton primary production most strongly in seven out of nine bioassay experiments with natural lake water from oligotrophic clearwater lakes. However, Fe put constraints on phytoplankton production in eight lakes. In one of these lakes, Fe was the nutrient that stimulated primary production most, and concurrent P and Fe limitation was observed in seven lakes. The effect of Fe addition increased with decreasing lake water concentrations of total phosphorus and dissolved organic matter. Possible mechanisms are low import rates and low bioavailability of Fe in the absence of organic chelators. The experimental results were used to predict the relative strength of Fe, N, and P limitation in 659 oligotrophic clearwater lakes (with total phosphorus <= 0.2 μM P and total organic carbon < 6 mg C l-¹) from a national lake survey. Fe was predicted to have a positive effect in 88% of these lakes, and to be the nutrient with the strongest effect in 30% of the lakes. In conclusion, Fe, along with P and N, is an important factor constraining primary production in oligotrophic clearwater lakes, which is a common lake-type throughout the northern biomes.</abstract>

    <title>Response of Net Ecosystem Productivity of Three Boreal Forest Stands to Drought</title>
    <abstract>In 2001-03, continuous eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide (CO₂) flux were made above mature boreal aspen, black spruce, and jack pine forests in Saskatchewan, Canada, prior to and during a 3-year drought. During the 1st drought year, ecosystem respiration (R) was reduced at the aspen site due to the drying of surface soil layers. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) increased as a result of a warm spring and a slow decrease of deep soil moisture. These conditions resulted in the highest annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the 9 years of flux measurements at this site. During 2002 and 2003, a reduction of 6% and 34% in NEP, respectively, compared to 2000 was observed as the result of reductions in both R and GEP, indicating a conservative response to the drought. Although the drought affected most of western Canada, there was considerable spatial variability in summer rainfall over the 100-km extent of the study area; summer rainfalls in 2001 and 2002 at the two conifer sites minimized the impact of the drought. In 2003, however, precipitation was similarly low at all three sites. Due to low topographic position and consequent poor drainage at the black spruce site and the coarse soil with low water-holding capacity at the jack pine site almost no reduction in R, GEP, and NEP was observed at these two sites. This study shows that the impact of drought on carbon sequestration by boreal forest ecosystems strongly depends on rainfall distribution, soil characteristics, topography, and the presence of vegetation that is well adapted to these conditions.</abstract>

    <title>Fire Severity in Conifer Forests of the Sierra Nevada, California</title>
    <abstract>Natural disturbances are an important source of environmental heterogeneity that have been linked to species diversity in ecosystems. However, spatial and temporal patterns of disturbances are often evaluated separately. Consequently, rates and scales of existing disturbance processes and their effects on biodiversity are often uncertain. We have studied both spatial and temporal patterns of contemporary fires in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA. Patterns of fire severity were analyzed for conifer forests in the three largest fires since 1999. These fires account for most cumulative area that has burned in recent years. They burned relatively remote areas where there was little timber management. To better characterize high-severity fire, we analyzed its effect on the survival of pines. We evaluated temporal patterns of fire since 1950 in the larger landscapes in which the three fires occurred. Finally, we evaluated the utility of a metric for the effects of fire suppression. Known as Condition Class it is now being used throughout the United States to predict where fire will be uncharacteristically severe. Contrary to the assumptions of fire management, we found that high-severity fire was uncommon. Moreover, pines were remarkably tolerant of it. The wildfires helped to restore landscape structure and heterogeneity, as well as producing fire effects associated with natural diversity. However, even with large recent fires, rates of burning are relatively low due to modern fire management. Condition Class was not able to predict patterns of high-severity fire. Our findings underscore the need to conduct more comprehensive assessments of existing disturbance regimes and to determine whether natural disturbances are occurring at rates and scales compatible with the maintenance of biodiversity.</abstract>

    <title>Assessment of cowpea and groundnut contributions to soil fertility and succeeding sorghum yields in the Guinean savannah zone of Burkina Faso (West Africa)</title>
    <abstract>Atmospheric biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and groundnut (Arachis hypogea) was evaluated using a 2-year (2000-2001) experiment with different fertilizer treatments. The ¹⁵N isotopic dilution method with a nonfixing cowpea as test reference crop was used. The effects of the two legumes on soil N availability and succeeding sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) yields were measured. Groundnut was found to fix 8 to 23 kg N ha-1 and the percentage of N derived from the atmosphere varied from 27 to 34%. Cowpea fixed 50 to 115 kg N ha-¹ and the percentage of N derived from the atmosphere varied from 52 to 56%. Compared to mineral NPK fertilizer alone, legumes fixed more N from the atmosphere when dolomite or manure was associated with mineral fertilizers. Compared to soluble phosphate, phosphate rock increased BNF by cowpea. Significant correlation (p<0.05, R ²=0.94) was observed between total N yields of legumes and total N derived from the atmosphere. Compared to monocropping of sorghum, the soils of cowpea-sorghum and groundnut-sorghum rotations increased soil mineral N from 15 and 22 kg N ha-¹, respectively. Cowpea-sorghum and groundnut-sorghum rotations doubled N uptake and increased succeeding sorghum yields by 290 and 310%, respectively. Results suggested that, despite their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, N containing fertilizers (NPK) are recommended for the two legumes. The applications of NPK associated with dolomite or cattle manure or NK fertilizer associated with phosphate rock were the better recommendations that improved BNF, legumes, and succeeding sorghum yields.</abstract>

    <title>Differential effects of lichens and mosses on soil enzyme activity and litter decomposition</title>
    <abstract>In the New Jersey Pinelands, canopy gaps in the pine-dominated forest support patches of lichens, mosses, and caespitose grasses. We tested the hypotheses that non-vascular plants and lichens can affect nutrient cycling processes and that mosses and lichens would differ from each other. We predicted that (1) lichen tissues would decompose more slowly than pine or moss tissues, (2) all plant materials would decompose more slowly beneath lichens than beneath mosses, and (3) soil enzyme activities would be higher under lichens than under mosses or grasses, reflecting greater nutrient limitation. We compared rates of decomposition of the litter of Pinus rigida and moss and lichen tissues, and measured soil enzyme activities responsible for nutrient mineralization from litter (acid and alkaline phosphatases, chitinase, β-glucosidase, aminopeptidase, and phenol oxidase) under three types of groundcover (lichens, mosses, and grasses) and unvegetated soil at two sites. While groundcover affected enzyme activities, the patterns of enzyme activities differed markedly between the two sites. In general, the enzyme activities were uniformly low. Decomposition rates were more strongly affected by the groundcover than by litter materials. While all litters tended to decompose more slowly under lichens than under mosses, supporting one of our initial hypotheses, the rates of decomposition were markedly different between the two sites. These results suggest that while mosses and lichens create patches of different soil function in both sites, the differences between the sites in unknown factors cause the enzyme activities and decomposition rates to differ.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of the addition of forest floor extracts on soil carbon dioxide efflux</title>
    <abstract>Composition and effects of additions of fibric (Oi) and hemic/sapric (Oe + Oa) layer extracts collected from a 20-year-old stand of radiata pine (Pinus radiata) on soil carbon dioxide (CO₂) evolution were investigated in a 94-day aerobic incubation. The ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that Oi layer extract contained greater concentrations of alkyl C while Oe + Oa layer extract was rich in carboxyl C. Extracts from Oi and Oe + Oa layers were added to a forest soil at two different polyphenol concentrations (43 and 85 μg g-¹ soil) along with tannic acid (TA) and glucose solutions to evaluate effects on soil CO₂ efflux. CO₂ evolution was greater in amended soils than control (deionized water) indicating that water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) was readily available to microbial degradation. However, addition of WSOC extracted from both Oi and Oe + Oa layers containing 85 μg polyphenols g-¹ soil severely inhibited microbial activity. Soils amended with extracts containing lower concentrations of polyphenols (43 μg polyphenols g-¹ soil), TA solutions, and glucose solutions released 2 to 22 times more CO₂-C than added WSOC, indicating a strong positive priming effect. The differences in CO₂ evolution rates were attributed to chemical composition of the forest floor extracts.</abstract>

    <abstract>A 10-week laboratory study, using an open incubation technique, was carried out to determine net sulphur (S) mineralization potentials of soil samples obtained from some representative soils in Tuscany, Italy. The time-course of organic S mineralization in the soils was analyzed by fitting the experimental values to three kinetic models (first-order, first-order E, zero-order). The first-order model was found to be the most suitable because it provided the best fit to the experimental data and for its simplicity. Potentially mineralized S (S ₀) values ranged from a minimum of 13.6 to a maximum of 50.7 mg kg-¹ soil and the mineralization rate k varied from 0.111 to 0.615 week-¹. It was also positively related to organic C, N, and S, protease, arylsulphatase, and dehydrogenase activities. The mineralization rate did not show any significant relationship with soil properties.</abstract>

    <title>Ecotoxicity Monitoring of Hydrocarbon-Contaminated Soil During Bioremediation: A Case Study</title>
    <abstract>The ecotoxicity of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil originating from a brownfield site was evaluated during a 17-month biodegradation pilot test. The initial concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) in the soil was 6380 μg/g dry weight. An amount of 200 kg soil was inoculated with 1.5 L of the bacterial preparation GEM-100 containing Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp. strains (5.3 x 10¹⁰ CFU.mL-¹) adapted to diesel fuel. The concentration of TPHs in the soil decreased by 65.5% after bioremediation. Different organisms such as the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, terrestrial plants Sinapis alba, Lactuca sativa, and Hordeum vulgare, the water plant Lemna minor, the earthworm Eisenia fetida, and the crustacean Heterocypris incongruens were used for ecotoxicity evaluation. The highest toxicity was detected in the first period of bioremediation. However, certain toxic effects were detectable during the whole bioremediation process. The contact tests with plants, earthworms, and crustaceans were the most sensitive of all of the bioassays. Therefore, the contact tests performed directly on soil samples were shown to be a better tool for ecotoxicity evaluation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil than the tests performed on soil elutriates. The ecotoxicity measured by the responses of the tests did not always correlate with the decrease in TPH concentrations in the soil during bioremediation.</abstract>

    <title>Blood Lead Concentrations in Waterfowl Utilizing Lake Coeur d'Alene, Idaho</title>
    <abstract>The Coeur d'Alene River Basin, Lake Coeur d'Alene, and the Spokane River contain elevated heavy metal concentrations in sediment and water from historical mining and ore processing operations in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. Lead poisoning has been identified as the cause of death in hundreds of waterfowl utilizing wetlands in the floodplain of the Coeur d'Alene River, but little was known about hazards to waterfowl from heavy metal contamination in shallow bays and wetlands of Lake Coeur d'Alene. We examined lake sediment and blood lead concentrations in waterfowl utilizing Lake Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to evaluate potential lead contamination of waterfowl utilizing the lake. We collected 56 palustrine and 102 lacustrine sediment samples and 61 mallard and 8 wood duck blood samples. Mean lead concentrations from palustrine and lacustrine sediment samples ranged from 14 to 3508 mg/kg dry weight (dw) and from 19 to 5009 mg/kg (dw), respectively. Lead concentrations in palustrine and lacustrine sediment from several Lake Coeur d'Alene bays were higher than those in lake reference areas and were higher than Bunker Hill Superfund Site target cleanup levels and suggested site-specific toxicity thresholds for swans. Mean blood lead from mallard and wood ducks sampled from Lake Coeur d'Alene bays were within lead toxicity ranges for waterfowl associated with clinical and severe clinical lead poisoning. We also collected 19 Canada goose and 3 mallard fecal samples to evaluate exposure through sediment ingestion. Waterfowl using Lake Coeur d'Alene appear to be exposed to lead by ingesting contaminated lake sediment. Our model predicts a sediment lead effects range of 147-944 mg/kg (dw) and mortality effects level of 1652 mg/kg (dw) for mallards utilizing Lake Coeur d'Alene. The locations of Harrison Slough, Powderhorn Bay, and Cottonwood Bay at the mouth of the Coeur d'Alene River and Blackwell Island and Cougar Bay near the Spokane River outflow of Lake Coeur d'Alene were the areas of greatest concern for waterfowl exposure to lead contaminated sediment.</abstract>

    <title>Induction of Oxidative Stress in Erythrocytes of Male Rats Subchronically Exposed to a Mixture of Eight Metals Found as Groundwater Contaminants in Different Parts of India</title>
    <abstract>Exposure of animals and humans to different metal components through contaminated drinking water can result in a wide range of adverse clinical conditions. Toxicological consequences arising from the concurrent repeated exposure to multiple metal contaminants are not known. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the oxidative stress-inducing potential of a mixture of eight metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, chromium, nickel, manganese, iron), representative of groundwater contamination in different areas of India, in erythrocytes of male rats subchronically exposed to environmentally relevant doses via drinking water. The selection of these metals, as determined by literature survey of groundwater contamination in India, was primarily based on the frequency of their occurrence and contamination level above World Health Organization maximum permissible limit (MPL) in drinking water. Male albino Wistar rats were exposed to the metal mixture at 0, 1, 10, and 100 times the mode concentrations (the most frequently occurring concentration) of the individual metals in drinking water for 90 days. In addition, one group of rats was also exposed to the mixture at a concentration equal to the MPL of individual components. The oxidative stress in erythrocytes was evaluated by assessing the magnitude of malondialdehyde production and reduced glutathione (GSH) content and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) after 30, 60, and 90 days of exposure. MPL and 1x dose levels did not cause any changes. The mixture at 10x and 100x doses caused dose- and time-dependent effects. After 30 days, the 10x dose did not cause any changes except increase in SOD activity. The 100x dose increased the activities of SOD, catalase and GR and the GSH level, but caused no alterations in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and GPx activity. After 60 days, the 10x dose did not cause any changes. The 100x dose increased LPO and decreased all the antioxidant parameters, except GSH. After 90 days, both 10x and 100x levels elevated LPO. The 10x dose decreased GSH level and activities of SOD and catalase, but not of GPx and GR, whereas the 100x dose decreased all the antioxidative systems. Overall, the present study demonstrates that the subchronic exposure of male rats to the mixture of metals via drinking water results in induction of oxidative stress and concomitant reduction in antioxidative defense system in erythrocytes at 10 and 100 times the mode concentrations of the individual metals in contaminated groundwater.</abstract>

    <abstract>At present there is a high level of uncertainty about whether or not soil samples, which are required to be toxicologically characterized, could be preserved without affecting their toxicological characteristics. In the existing DIN/ISO standards for soil investigations, there is no documentation on the storage of soil samples after collection for (eco-)toxicological investigations. Furthermore, procedures for receiving justifiable and verifiable results from soil samples are quite vague. Therefore, the stability and changes in the biological effects of different soil contaminants were investigated by varying the storage conditions and the storage times of the soil. The limitations of storing soils could therefore be subsequently outlined. Recommendations for the optimization of storage conditions for back-up soil samples were made. These recommendations have the capability of finding entrance into DIN/ISO standards.</abstract>

    <title>Influence of Phosphate on the Response of Periphyton to Atrazine Exposure</title>
    <abstract>After indications from the literature that nutrient concentrations may modify the toxicity of herbicides to natural periphyton communities, this study aims to provide experimental proof for atrazine. In this microcosm experiment, phosphate (P) addition did not ameliorate atrazine toxicity to periphyton. Three weeks of P addition did not increase atrazine tolerance (measured as EC50 in acute toxicity tests), whereas exposure to atrazine under conditions that were either P-limited or non-P-limited clearly reduced the development of algal biomass. Long-term exposure to atrazine induced tolerance of the community to the herbicide, and this was not influenced by P addition. Tolerance induction in this microcosm experiment has been compared with previously published field data from the same area of study and indicates that tolerance induction by atrazine may take place under atrazine exposure in streams as well as in microcosms.</abstract>

    <title>Preliminary Examination of Short-Term Cellular Toxicological Responses of the Coral Madracis mirabilis to Acute Irgarol 1051 Exposure</title>
    <abstract>Irgarol 1051 is an s-triazine herbicide formulated with Cu2O in antifouling paints. Recent studies have shown that Irgarol 1051 inhibits coral photosynthesis at environmentally relevant concentrations, consistent with its mode of action as a photosystem II inhibitor. Related toxicologic effects of this herbicide on coral cellular physiology have not yet been investigated. We used cellular diagnostics to measure changes in 18 toxicologic cellular parameters in endosymbiotic algal (dinoflagellate) and cnidarian (host) fractions of the common branching coral Madracis mirabilis associated with in vivo 8- and 24-hour exposures to a nominal initial Irgarol 1051 concentration of 10 μg L-¹. Responses measured were (1) xenobiotic response, which includes total and dinoflagellate multixenobiotic resistance (MXR), cnidarian cytochrome (CYP) P450-3 and P450-6 classes, cnidarian, and dinoflagellate glutathione-s-transferase (GST); (b) oxidative damage and response, which includes cnidarian and dinoflagellate Cu/Zn and Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD), cnidarian and dinoflagellate glutathione peroxidase (GPx), cnidarian catalase, and total protein carbonyl); (3) metabolic homeostasis, which includes chloroplast and invertebrate small heat-shock proteins (sHsp), cnidarian protoporphyrinogen oxidase IX (PPO), cnidarian ferrochelatase, and cnidarian heme oxygenase; and (4) protein metabolic condition, which includes cnidarian and dinoflagellate heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp60), total ubiquitin, and cnidarian ubiquitin ligase. Acute responses to Irgarol 1051 exposure included significant increases in total and dinoflagellate MXR, dinoflagellate Cu/Zn SOD, dinoflagellate chloroplast sHsp, and cnidarian PPO. Irgarol 1051 exposure resulted in decreases in cnidarian GPx, cnidarian ferrochelatase, cnidarian catalase, and cnidarian CYP 450-3 and -6 classes. Related implications of Irgarol 1051 exposure to coral cellular condition are discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Impact of Diuron on Aneuploidy and Hemocyte Parameters in Pacific Oyster, Crassostrea gigas</title>
    <abstract>Diuron is a substituted urea herbicide used for agricultural and nonagricultural weed control. Its widespread use and relatively slow breakdown led us to analyze its influence on aneuploidy level (lowered chromosome number in a percentage of somatic cells) and hemocyte parameters in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Adult oysters were subjected to two diuron concentrations (300 ng L-¹ and 3 μg L-¹) for 11 weeks. Significantly higher aneuploidy level was observed in diuron-treated oysters compared with the control. Furthermore, the observed impact on aneuploidy persisted to the next generation as offspring exhibited significantly higher aneuploidy levels when their parents had been exposed to diuron. Significant increases in hemocyte parameters (cell mortality, phagocytosis, granulocyte percentage, reactive oxygen species, and lysosome presence) of the adults were also observed after 4 weeks of diuron exposure. The effects observed on oyster aneuploidy level and hemocyte parameters could have serious environmental and practical consequences.</abstract>

    <title>Laboratory Investigation of the Toxicity and Interaction of Pesticide Mixtures in Daphnia magna</title>
    <abstract>The probabilistic ecological risk assessment-toxic equivalent (PERA-TE) combination approach is a relatively new risk assessment approach used to assess the toxicity and interaction of chemical mixtures. The validity and effectiveness of the PERA-TE combination approach has been tested previously in field microcosm studies using pesticide mixtures. The related laboratory studies described here, using Daphnia magna, were conducted to verify the conclusions made regarding the toxicity and interaction of the mixtures tested in the microcosms. Two types of pesticide mixture were assessed: the first consisted of pesticides with similar modes of action (chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and azinphos-methyl; OP mixture), and the second consisted of pesticides with different modes of action (chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and trifluralin; CET mixture). Similar to the field studies, PERA-TE mixtures with a predetermined effect assessment criterion (10th centile of acute toxicity effects distributions) and proportional ratio (89:11 for binary mixture and 80:10:10 for ternary mixtures) were tested. Further assessment of the (PERA-) TE approach was achieved by altering the effect assessment criterion (to EC/LC₅₀ point estimates) and the proportional ratio of the pesticides in the mixture (to 50:25:25). Generally, but with some exceptions, basing mixtures on species-specific effect criteria and/or changing the proportional ratio of pesticides in the mixture redistributed the concentration of pesticides in the mixture to produce an equitoxic response. The ability to produce these equitoxic responses supported the conclusions drawn from the field studies: The pesticide toxicity in the OP and CET PERA-TE mixtures were effectively additive. Furthermore, it is shown that these alternative (PERA-) TE mixtures would be suitable to confirm or reject the interaction of chemicals in a PERA-TE mixture.</abstract>

    <title>Contaminants in Fish of the Hackensack Meadowlands, New Jersey: Size, Sex, and Seasonal Relationships as Related to Health Risks</title>
    <abstract>The trace metal content and related safety (health risk) of Hackensack River fish were assessed within the Hackensack Meadowlands of New Jersey, USA. Eight elements were analyzed in the edible portion (i.e., muscle) of species commonly taken by anglers in the area. The white perch collection (Morone americana) was large enough (n = 168) to enable statistically significant inferences, but there were too few brown bullheads and carp to reach definite conclusions. Of the eight elements analyzed, the one that accumulates to the point of being a health risk in white perch is mercury (Hg). Relationships between mercury concentrations and size and with collection season were observed; correlation with lipid content, total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content, or collection site were very weak. Only 18% of the Hg was methylated in October (n = 8), whereas June and July fish (n = 12) had 100% methylation of Hg. White perch should not be considered edible because the Hg level exceeded the “one meal per month” action level of 0.47 μg/g wet weight (ppm) in 32% of our catch and 2.5% exceeded the “no consumption at all” level of 1 μg/g. The larger fish represent greater risk for Hg. Furthermore, the warmer months, when more recreational fishing takes place, might present greater risk. A more significant reason for avoiding white perch is the PCB contamination because 40% of these fish exceeded the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action level of 2000 ng/g for PCBs and all white perch exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency cancer/health guideline (49 ng/g) of no more than one meal/month. In fact, nearly all were 10 times that advisory level. There were differences between male and female white perch PCB levels, with nearly all of those above the US FDA action level being male. Forage fish (mummichogs and Atlantic silversides) were similarly analyzed, but no correlations were found with any other parameters. The relationship of collection site to contaminants cannot be demonstrated because sufficient numbers of game fish could not be collected at many sites at all seasons.</abstract>

    <title>Relationship Between Wetlands and Mercury in Brook Trout</title>
    <abstract>The purpose of this study was to determine if wetlands influence mercury concentrations in brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), benthic macroinvertebrates, and stream water. On September 26, 2005, water samples, benthic macroinvertebrates, and brook trout were collected from four streams in western Maryland under low-flow conditions. Water samples were also collected in these four streams under high-flow conditions in January 2006. The watersheds of Blue Lick and Monroe Run did not contain wetlands, but the watersheds of the Upper Savage River (3% of upstream area) and Little Savage River (7% of upstream area) contained wetlands. We found significantly (p = 0.05) higher average total mercury concentration in brook trout from Little Savage River (129 ± 54 ng g-¹); intermediate concentrations (66 ± 19 ng g-¹) in brook trout from Upper Savage River; and lowest concentrations in brook trout from Blue Lick (28 ± 11 ng g-¹) and Monroe Run (23 ± 19 ng g-¹). Brook trout in all streams accumulated mercury at the same rate over their lifetimes, but the youngest fish had significantly different mercury concentrations (Little Savage > Upper Savage > Blue Lick = Monroe Run), which may be due to differences in mercury concentrations in the eggs or food for the fry. Mercury concentrations in brook trout were not consistent with mercury concentrations in stream water and benthic macroinvertebrates. The Little Savage River had significantly higher total and methylmercury concentrations in stream water, but mercury concentrations in the other streams and in the benthic macroinvertebrates were not significantly different among streams. The unusually high methylmercury concentrations (0.5 to 2.1 ng L-¹) in the Little Savage River may have been caused by production of methylmercury in the pools. The relatively low methylmercury concentrations in the Upper Savage River may be caused by a mercury concentration gradient downstream of the wetland.</abstract>

    <title>History of potato wart disease in Europe - a proposal for harmonisation in defining pathotypes</title>
    <abstract>Potato wart disease, caused by the chytridiomycete Synchytrium endobioticum, was first introduced into Europe in the late 19th century. It spread quickly, and today is reported in 15 European countries. Initially, only one pathotype was found, and the disease was efficiently controlled using resistant cultivars. In 1941, however, formerly resistant cultivars showed wart formation in the field simultaneously in Germany and South Bohemia (Czech Republic), indicating the occurrence of new pathotypes. New pathotypes have since been reported from Germany, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Canada. Today the pathogen is present in The Netherlands (only in fields for ware and starch potatoes) but restricted to two demarcated areas and subject to official control. Outside these areas, the pathogen is absent. For pathotyping, different countries have used different sets of differential cultivars, and the usual system of numerical coding of pathotypes has not been consistently followed. In this review we propose a new standardised code to be used for the 43 pathotypes currently known and described in Europe. The code is a combination of a numerical and letter code, combining the two terminologies used by former West and East Germany, respectively. We also plead for harmonisation in the choice of differential cultivars used for pathotype identification. The set of differentials described in the international standard for diagnosis of S. endobioticum issued by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO), should serve as a basis. Through close collaboration of European countries dealing with new pathotypes of potato wart disease, a final agreed upon set of differentials, combined with a set of reference isolates, should ultimately be established, allowing a clear distinction between the most important pathotypes occurring in Europe.</abstract>

    <title>Development of an effective screening method for partial resistance to Alternaria brassicicola (dark leaf spot) in Brassica rapa</title>
    <abstract>In order to develop a method to measure resistance to Alternaria brassicicola (cause of dark leaf spot disease) in Brassica rapa, the effects of inoculum concentration, leaf stage, leaf age and incubation temperature of inoculation on infection were studied under controlled conditions using several B. rapa genotypes. Three inoculation methods (cotyledon, detached leaf and seedling inoculation) were evaluated for this purpose. The detached leaf inoculation test was the most suitable for screening B. rapa genotypes because clear symptoms were observed on the leaves in less than 24 h, and there was a significant positive correlation between the results from the detached leaf inoculation test and the seedling inoculation test, an established method considered to yield reliable results. In addition, it was very easy to screen plants for resistance on a large scale and to maintain standard physical conditions using detached leaves. For successful infection, inoculum concentration should be adjusted to 5 x 10⁴ conidia ml-¹, and incubation temperature should be between 20 °C and 25 °C. The 3rd/4th true leaves from 30 day-old plants were optimal for inoculation. In a screening test using 52 cultivars of B. rapa, the detached leaf test effectively discriminated between various levels of partial resistance among cultivars. As a result, we identified two cultivars, viz Saori and Edononatsu, as highly resistant and five cultivars, viz Tokinashi Taisai, Yajima Kabu, Purara, Norin-F₁-Bekana and Tateiwa Kabu, as having borderline resistance.</abstract>

    <title>Non-random distribution among a guild of parasitoids: implications for community structure and host survival</title>
    <abstract>1. Immature stages of the gall midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, are attacked by four species of parasitoids, which vary in size and relative abundance within patches of the gall midge's primary host plant, sea oxeye daisy (Borrichia frutescens). 2. In the current study, a bagging experiment found that the smallest wasp, Galeopsomyia haemon, was most abundant in galls exposed to natural enemies early in the experiment, when gall diameter is smallest, while the wasp with the longest ovipositor, Torymus umbilicatus, dominated the parasitoid community in galls that were not exposed until the 5th and 6th weeks when gall diameter is maximal. 3. Moreover, the mean number of parasitoids captured using large artificial galls were 70% and 150% higher compared with medium and small galls respectively, while stem height of artificial galls significantly affected parasitoid distribution. Galls that were level with the top of the sea oxeye canopy captured 60% more parasitoids compared with those below the canopy and 50% more than galls higher than the plant canopy. 4. These non-random patterns were driven primarily by the differential distribution of the largest parasitoid, T. umbilicatus, which was found significantly more often than expected on large galls and the smallest parasitoid of the guild, G. haemon, which tended to be more common on stems level with the top of the plant canopy. 5. Large Asphondylia galls, especially those located near the top of the Borrichia canopy, were more likely to be discovered by searching parasitoids. Results using artificial galls were consistent with rates of parasitism of Asphondylia galls in native patches of sea oxeye daisy. Gall diameter was 19% greater and the rate of parasitism was reduced by almost 50% on short stems; as a result, gall abundance was 24% higher on short stems compared with ones located near the top of the plant canopy. 6. These results suggest that parasitoid community composition within galls is regulated by both interspecific differences in ovipositor length and preferences for specific gall size and/or stem length classes.</abstract>

    <title>Ecological distribution and niche segregation of sibling species: the case of bean beetles, Acanthoscelides obtectus Say and A. obvelatus Bridwell</title>
    <abstract>1. Molecular techniques have greatly added to the number of known sympatric cryptic species in insects. Ecological differences between these newly distinguished species are little explored, but niches often appear to overlap strongly. These cases are good models for exploring new ideas about species coexistence and community structure. 2. Acanthoscelides obtectus and A. obvelatus are two sister species of bean bruchids, which have been confused until the last decade. One important ecological difference between them has emerged, however: A. obtectus is multivoltine and now distributed worldwide, whereas A. obvelatus is univoltine and restricted to Mesoamerica. Where their ranges overlap, the two species share the same host plants and larvae can sometimes complete development in the same seed. 3. The analysis of 27 622 Mexican individuals of the two species in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 indicates that their niches overlap, but are differentiated with respect to altitude and the kind of beans (wild vs. domesticated). The principal patterns in their relative abundance in different habitats, and at different seasons, were constant from one year to the next. 4. As sympatry of these species seems to be of recent origin, the observed niche differentiation may not have evolved in response to competition, but could instead be the consequence of physiological differences, evolved independently in each species in allopatry, that pre-adapted them for different altitudes and kinds of resources. 5. The combination of biological and historical factors thus appears to allow these two sibling species to coexist in sympatry, despite their broadly overlapping ecological niches.</abstract>

    <title>The effect of egg load on readiness to accept a low-quality host plant is weak and age dependent in a geometrid moth</title>
    <abstract>1. Most empirical and theoretical studies treat egg load as a major determinant of insect oviposition behaviour, and predict a positive link between egg load and readiness to oviposit. 2. In the present study, the correlation between egg load and readiness to lay eggs on a low-ranked host was examined in wild-caught moths, Scotopteryx chenopodiata L. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). 3. No overall effect of egg load on oviposition could be detected. However, there was a significant interaction between egg load and wing wear: in only one wing-wear class, out of four, high egg load tended to promote oviposition, while in the three other classes the effect was insignificant. 4. The results suggest that the effect of egg load on oviposition may depend on the age of the ovipositing insect.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of grazing and ant/beetle interaction on seed production in the legume Vicia sepium in a seminatural grassland</title>
    <abstract>1. Seed production can be affected by cattle grazing, insect herbivores, and seed predators. Bush vetch, Vicia sepium L. (Fabaceae), possess extra floral nectaries (EFNs), which can attract ants that act as plant defenders. 2. In this field study, four different manipulations were used to investigate interactions between V. sepium, ants, aphids, and seed predators, mainly Bruchus atomarius. The experiment was set up in grazed and non-grazed plots in a semi-natural grassland in south-central Sweden. 3. Grazing negatively affected number of V. sepium buds, flowers, and pods. Seed set, defined as the number of developed seeds per number of ovules in a pod, was higher in grazed plots. Ant abundance, however, was not affected by grazing. Ten different ant species were found on V. sepium and the number of ants was positively correlated with the presence of EFNs. Aphids were found only when ants were excluded from the plants. Pod and seed production of V. sepium plants was not affected by the presence of ants. The seed predator B. atomarius was not affected by the presence of ants. No support was found for the supposition that V. sepium benefited from attracting ants by producing extra floral nectar. 4. A small observational study of V. sepium plants in shrub (Rosa dumalis) plots compared with grassland plots was added to the experimental study. Vicia sepium plants were longer and had higher seed-set (seeds/ovules) in shrub plots than in grassland plots.</abstract>

    <abstract>1. Based on the geographic distribution database of museum specimens and published literature, the diversity and distribution of aphids in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau-Himalayas was studied using the GIS method. 2. A total of 646 aphid species/subspecies belonging to 195 genera in Adelgidae, Phylloxeridae, and 16 subfamilies of Aphididae were recorded from this region; among which Aphidinae shared the highest species proportion (343 species, 53.1%), followed by Greenidinae (63, 9.7%), Eriosomatinae (54, 8.3%), and Lachninae (48, 7.4%). A total of 326 species and 20 genera are endemic to this region. 3. The aphid fauna has diverse faunal components and shows affinity with other zoogeographic realms. It is also rich in alpine species. 4. The aphid fauna exhibits an asymmetric distribution pattern with few species found on the high surface of the plateau. Four distribution centres were mapped. These were (i) the associated mountainous areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the western Qinling Mountains and southern Gansu Province, (ii) the Hengduan Mountains Region, (iii) the eastern Himalayas, and (iv) the western Himalayas. 5. The aphid fauna of the region may have multiple origins, and has been influenced by geological and ecological factors, such as glaciers and diversified vegetation. Possible reasons for the species diversity and distribution patterns are discussed. The implications and priorities for conservation based, on these distribution patterns, are also discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Honey bee and bumblebee trypanosomatids: specificity and potential for transmission</title>
    <abstract>1. Experimental studies of multihost parasite dynamics are scarce. Understanding the transmission dynamics of parasites in these systems is a key task in developing better models of parasite evolution and to make more accurate predictions of disease dynamics. 2. Bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) host the trypanosomatid parasite, Crithidia bombi. Its transmission in the field occurs through the shared use of flowers. Flowers are a perfect scenario for inter-taxa transmission of diseases because they are used by a wide range of animals. 3. Honey bees host a poorly studied trypanosomatid, Crithidia mellificae. In this study, five questions have been experimentally addressed: (a) Can C. bombi infect honey bees? (b) Can C. mellificae infect bumblebees? (c) Can the honey bee act as a vector for C. bombi? (d) Are C. bombi cells present in honey-bee faeces? (e) Does C. bombi have an effect on the mortality of honey bees after ingestion? 4. While both parasites were found to be specific to their hosts at the genus level, results suggest that honey bees may play a role in the epidemiology of C. bombi transmission.</abstract>

    <title>Infestation of commercial bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) field colonies by small hive beetles (Aethina tumida)</title>
    <abstract>1. The small hive beetle, Aethina tumida, is a parasite of honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies native to sub-Saharan Africa and has become an invasive species. In North America the beetle is now sympatric with bumblebees, Bombus, not occurring in its native range. Laboratory studies have shown that small hive beetles can reproduce in bumblebee colonies but it was not known whether infestations occur in the field. 2. For the first time, infestation of bumblebee colonies by small hive beetles was investigated in the field. Commercial Bombus impatiens colonies (n= 10) were installed in proximity to infested apiaries. Within 8 weeks, all colonies that were alive in the 5-week observation period (n= 9) became naturally infested with adult small hive beetles and successful small hive beetle reproduction occurred in five colonies. 3. In four-square choice tests, the beetles were attracted to both adult bumblebee workers and pollen from bumblebee nests, suggesting that these odours may serve as cues for host finding. 4. The data indicate that bumblebee colonies may serve as alternative hosts for small hive beetles in the field. To foster the conservation of these essential native pollinators, investigations on the actual impact of small hive beetles on wild bumblebee populations are suggested.</abstract>

    <title>Dynamic matching of forager size to resources in the continuously polymorphic leaf-cutter ant, Atta colombica (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)</title>
    <abstract>1. Ergonomic optimisation theory proposes that by increasing variation in worker morphology, social insect colonies may increase their dietary breadth; however, little is known about how this relationship operates at the colony level. This study examines the colony-level pattern of forager size allocation to resource sites in a natural setting. 2. Using a biologically relevant measure of toughness, it is shown that leaf-cutter ant colonies exploit a variety of plant resources that vary significantly in toughness at any given time. 3. Forager size is shown to be matched to the toughness of plant material, with larger ants harvesting tougher material. 4. Furthermore, outbound foragers travelling to a harvest site are matched in size to the toughness of plant material contained within the site and are not a random selection of available foragers. The match between forager size and plant toughness may reduce the number of wasted trips and ill-matched foragers. 5. The observed colony-level pattern of forager allocation could be the result of learning by individual foragers, or the result of information shared at the colony level.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and isolation on the density, species richness, and distribution of ladybeetles in manipulated alfalfa landscapes</title>
    <abstract>1. Habitat loss and fragmentation are the main causes of changes in the distribution and abundance of organisms, and are usually considered to negatively affect the abundance and species richness of organisms in a landscape. Nevertheless, habitat loss and fragmentation have often been confused, and the reported negative effects may only be the result of habitat loss alone, with habitat fragmentation having nil or even positive effects on abundance and species richness. 2. Manipulated alfalfa micro-landscapes and coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are used to test the effects habitat loss (0% or 84%), fragmentation (4 or 16 fragments), and isolation (2 or 6 m between fragments) on the density, species richness, and distribution of native and exotic species of coccinellids. 3. Generally, when considering only the individuals in the remaining fragments, habitat loss had variable effects while habitat fragmentation had a positive effect on the density of two species of coccinellids and on species richness, but did not affect two other species. Isolation usually had no effect. When individuals in the whole landscape were considered, negative effects of habitat loss became apparent for most species, but the positive effects of fragmentation remained only for one species. 4. Native and exotic species of coccinellids did not segregate in the different landscapes, and strong positive associations were found most often in landscapes with higher fragmentation and isolation. 5. The opposing effects of habitat loss and fragmentation may result in a nil global effect; therefore it is important to separate their effects when studying populations in fragmented landscapes.</abstract>

    <title>Petal herbivory by chrysomelid beetles (Phyllotreta sp.) is detrimental to pollination and seed production in Lepidium papilliferum (Brassicaceae)</title>
    <abstract>1. Insect herbivory directed at flowers can decrease fruit and seed production by decreasing the attractiveness of a damaged flower to potential pollinators, by disrupting the transfer of pollen between pollinators and stigmas, or both. 2. Effects of petal herbivory by a chrysomelid beetle (Phyllotreta sp.) on pollination and seed production in Lepidium papilliferum (Brassicaceae) were examined. 3. Under natural conditions, flowers with a hole chewed in a petal produced fruit and seed at a significantly lower rate than undamaged flowers (44% vs. 80% respectively). However, when damaged and undamaged flowers were hand pollinated, there was no significant difference in fruit or seed set (84% vs. 80% respectively). 4. Petal herbivory in L. papilliferum disrupts the effectiveness of insect-mediated pollination, but it does not physically inhibit pollination or seed production.</abstract>

    <title>'Suicide' of crickets harbouring hairworms: a proteomics investigation</title>
    <abstract>Despite increasing evidence of host phenotypic manipulation by parasites, the underlying mechanisms causing infected hosts to act in ways that benefit the parasite remain enigmatic in most cases. Here, we used proteomics tools to identify the biochemical alterations that occur in the head of the cricket Nemobius sylvestris when it is driven to water by the hairworm Paragordius tricuspidatus. We characterized host and parasite proteomes during the expression of the water-seeking behaviour. We found that the parasite produces molecules from the Wnt family that may act directly on the development of the central nervous system (CNS). In the head of manipulated cricket, we found differential expression of proteins specifically linked to neurogenesis, circadian rhythm and neurotransmitter activities. We also detected proteins for which the function(s) are still unknown. This proteomics study on the biochemical pathways altered by hairworms has also allowed us to tackle questions of physiological and molecular convergence in the mechanism(s) causing the alteration of orthoptera behaviour. The two hairworm species produce effective molecules acting directly on the CNS of their orthoptera hosts.</abstract>

    <title>Juvenile hormone and colony conditions differentially influence cytochrome P450 gene expression in the termite Reticulitermes flavipes*</title>
    <abstract>In lower termites, the worker caste is a totipotent immature stage that is capable of differentiating into other adult caste phenotypes. We investigated the diversity of family 4 cytochrome P450 (CYP4) genes in Reticulitermes flavipes workers, with the specific goal of identifying P450s potentially involved in regulating caste differentiation. Seven novel CYP4 genes were identified. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed the tissue distribution of expression for the seven CYP4s, as well as temporal expression changes in workers in association with a release from colony influences and during juvenile hormone (JH)-induced soldier caste differentiation. Several fat-body-related CYP4 genes were differentially expressed after JH treatment. Still other genes changed expression in association with removal from colony influences, suggesting that primer pheromones and/or other colony influences impact their expression. These findings add to a growing database of candidate termite caste-regulatory genes, and provide explicit evidence that colony factors influence termite gene expression.</abstract>

Numerous abortive oospores were observed in these strains and isozyme analysis showed all were heterozygous for the dimeric malic enzyme (MDHP). More detailed comparisons indicated that their MDHP alleles matched those of both P. cactorum and P. hedraiandra. Cloning and sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the atypical P. cactorum strains demonstrated the presence of sequences characteristic for both P. cactorum and P. hedraiandra. It was concluded that the atypical strains represented hybrids between the resident P. cactorum and the apparently recently introduced P. hedraiandra. Most strains had the mitochondrially inherited cytochrome oxidase I (Cox I) gene typical of one putative parent P. hedraiandra, while one single strain had that of the other putative parent, consistent with the hybrid hypothesis. Our data also suggest that the hybrids are evolving. The hybrids have proliferated on multiple new hosts in the Netherlands.</abstract>

    <title>Evaluation of the durability of the Barley yellow dwarf virus-resistant Zhong ZH and TC14 wheat lines</title>
    <abstract>Serial passage experiments (SPE) of a Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV) isolate were performed on Zhong ZH and TC14 wheat lines to evaluate the durability of their resistance to BYDV. At different passage numbers (from the 2nd to the 114th), biological properties of the produced isolates were recorded either by monitoring infection percentages and virus titers of the first 3 weeks of viral infection or by measuring their impact on yield components. Statistical analyses using the area under pathogen progress curves and the area under concentration progress curves demonstrated that these two resistant lines induce, after only a few passages, a selection of variant(s) with significantly modified infection abilities. Isolates resulting from SPE performed on these lines induced important decreases of yield components. These results indicate that the use of Zhong ZH and TC14 lines in BYDV-resistant breeding programmes should be approached with caution.</abstract>

    <title>Are field populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi able to suppress the transmission of seed-borne Bipolaris sorokiniana to aerial plant parts</title>
    <abstract>The development of seed-borne Bipolaris sorokiniana in barley in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was studied. To exploit natural variation in their ability to control disease development, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from various Swedish arable soils were multiplied in trap cultures using a mixture of plant species. Six out of eight trap culture soil inocula were able to reduce transmission of B. sorokiniana from seeds to stem bases when grown together with infected barley seed. Based on this result two soil inocula, of different origin, from semi-natural grassland and barley respectively, were chosen for further greenhouse studies. Both soil inocula gave significant reductions in pathogen transmission from seeds to seedlings compared to the untreated control. In addition, treatment with spore inocula, collected from the different trap culture soils, showed disease suppression. Treatment with spores from the pure culture Glomus intraradices gave significant reduction in leaf lesion development. A treatment with the commercial inoculum Vaminoc® was included and gave some suppression of the pathogen. In conclusion this study has shown that AM soil inocula from trap cultures suppressed the transmission of seed-borne B. sorokiniana in the aerial parts of barley plants.</abstract>

    <title>Host status and reaction of Medicago truncatula accessions to infection by three major pathogens of pea (Pisum sativum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa)</title>
    <abstract>Ditylenchus dipsaci, the stem nematode of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), Mycosphaerella pinodes, cause of Ascochyta blight in pea (Pisum sativum) and Aphanomyces euteiches, cause of pea root rot, result in major yield losses in French alfalfa and pea crops. These diseases are difficult to control and the partial resistances currently available are not effective enough. Medicago truncatula, the barrel medic, is the legume model for genetic studies, which should lead to the identification and characterization of new resistance genes for pathogens. We evaluated a collection of 34 accessions of M. truncatula and nine accessions from three other species (two from M. italica, six from M. littoralis and one from M. polymorpha) for resistance to these three major diseases. We developed screening tests, including standard host references, for each pathogen. Most of the accessions tested were resistant to D. dipsaci, with only three accessions classified as susceptible. A very high level of resistance to M. pinodes was observed among the accessions, none of which was susceptible to this pathogen. Conversely, a high level of variation, from resistant to susceptible accessions, was identified in response to infection by A. euteiches.</abstract>

    <title>Amaranthus leaf mottle virus: 3'-end RNA sequence proves classification as distinct virus and reveals affinities within the genus Potyvirus</title>
    <abstract>Amaranthus leaf mottle virus (AmLMV) was classified as a member of the genus Potyvirus on the basis of its particle morphology, serology, and biological properties (Casetta et al., 1986). Based on these properties, an Amaranthus viridis-infecting virus isolated in Spain, causing mottle and leaf blistering as well as reduced growth has been identified as AmLMV. The 3' terminal genomic region of this and a reference isolate from Italy has been sequenced and reveals a 95% nucleotide identity between the two isolates. The sequenced part comprises the coat protein with 281 amino acids and 315 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) preceding a polyadenylated tail. Pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the CP and 3' UTR of the cloned cDNAs with those of other potyviruses shows that AmLMV is a distinct potyvirus closely related to Potato virus Y.</abstract>

    <title>Host range expansion in a powdery mildew fungus (Golovinomyces sp.) infecting Arabidopsis thaliana: Torenia fournieri as a new host</title>
    <abstract>Since 2003, Torenia fournieri plants grown for experimental purposes were repeatedly infected by powdery mildew in a laboratory in Hungary. Based on morphological characteristics, the pathogen belonged to the mitosporic genus Oidium subgen. Reticuloidium, the anamorph stage of Golovinomyces. The rDNA ITS sequence was identical to that of two other powdery mildew fungi, infecting Arabidopsis and Veronica, respectively, in different parts of the world. According to a previous phylogenetic analysis of ITS and 28S rDNA sequences, those two powdery mildews belong to a recently evolved group of Golovinomyces characterized by multiple host range expansions during their evolution. Both the ITS sequence and the morphological data indicate that the powdery mildew anamorph infecting Torenia also belongs to this group. It is likely that the powdery mildew infections of the experimental T. fournieri plants, native to south-east Asia, were the result of a very recent host range expansion of a polyphagous Golovinomyces because (i) T. fournieri is absent from our region, except as an experimental plant grown in the laboratory, (ii) the powdery mildew fungus infecting this exotic plant belongs to a group of Golovinomyces where host range expansion is a frequent evolutionary scenario, (iii) cross-inoculation tests showed that this pathogen is also able to infect other plant species, notably A. thaliana and tobacco, and (iv) no Golovinomyces species are known to infect T. fournieri anywhere in the world. Although host range expansion has often been proposed as a common evolutionary process in the Erysiphales, and also in other biotrophic plant pathogens, this has not been clearly demonstrated in any case studies so far. To our knowledge, this is the first convincing case of a host range expansion event in the Erysiphales.</abstract>

    <title>Distribution of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Soil and Grasses Around Mt. Qomolangma, China</title>
    <abstract>Previous literature has reported the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in mountainous regions, but the Himalayas have received little attention, and few results from this region have been published. The present study collected soil and grass samples from the Mt. Qomolangma (Everest) area, central Himalayas, China, from the elevation range 4700 to 5620 m. We analyzed all samples for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) to determine the level of OCP contamination in the Qomolangma region. The soil samples contained 0.385 to 6.06 ng g-¹ of DDT only, and these concentrations were lower than those from Europe and mountains close to industrial emissions. Our study detected a number of OCPs in the grass samples, such as hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) (0.354 to 7.82 ng g-¹), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (0.0156 to 1.25 ng g-¹), endosulfan (0.105 to 3.14 ng g-¹), and DDT components (1.08 to 6.99 ng g-¹). Their concentrations were higher than those in pine needles from Alberta, Canada. Our measurements of HCH and DDT in grass samples showed the same or slightly higher concentration levels than reported in moss from Mt. Qomolangma 15 years ago. This result and the analysis of isomer ratios (α/γ-HCH and p-p'-DDE/p-p'-DDT) indicate recent releases of OCPs from a nearby region, possibly from dicofol use in India. We also investigated the elevation distribution of OCPs and found that HCH and HCB were progressively concentrated in colder, higher elevation sites. A bioconcentration factor (BCF) of grass was calculated, and the BCF values increased with the increasing elevation, indicating that the cold condensation of POPs at high-elevation sites may increase the potential threat to vegetation and the food chain in the mountain ecosystem.</abstract>

    <title>Acute Toxicity and Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition in Grass Shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) and Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) Exposed to the Organophosphate Dichlorvos: Laboratory and Field Studies</title>
    <abstract>The use of various organophosphates to control mosquito populations is a common practice across the globe. We review the literature (LC₅₀s) on dichlorvos, the primary breakdown product of Dibrom®, and use laboratory and field experiments to determine the lethal and sublethal (bioassays) effects of dichlorvos on two widely distributed and ecologically important estuarine invertebrate species, the marsh grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio and the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Laboratory results based on LC₅₀s and sublethal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity bioassays indicate that adult grass shrimp are more sensitive (~ 500 x ) to dichlorvos than juvenile oysters. Although potentially an important factor for intertidal or shallow-dwelling estuarine organisms, the toxicity of dichlorvos was not enhanced in the presence of simulated sunlight for adult P. pugio. The most notable decreases in AChE activity were for grass shrimp and oysters exposed to dichlorvos concentrations above those considered ecologically relevant. In field experiments, both species were deployed in cages in unsprayed (n = 2) and sprayed (n = 3) sites and water samples collected pre- and post-spraying. Quantifiable dichlorvos levels were measured at the two narrowest creek treatment sites following mosquito spraying, suggesting that overspray can occur and there was evidence of a sublethal AChE response at these same sites. However, experiments at the widest creek revealed no measurable dichlorvos or sublethal responses. Results from this research suggest that adult grass shrimp are more sensitive to dichlorvos than juvenile oysters. Spraying near small tidal creeks may have measurable impacts on resident species, while larger (wider) creeks appear to be capable of buffering organisms from transient fluxes of mosquito control agents that may enter the system.</abstract>

    <title>Toxicity of Three Polyethoxylated Tallowamine Surfactant Formulations to Laboratory and Field Collected Fairy Shrimp, Thamnocephalus platyurus</title>
    <abstract>Polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA) is a non-ionic surfactant used in herbicide formulations to increase the efficacy of active ingredients. POEA promotes penetration of herbicide active ingredients into plant cuticles, and in animal species is known to cause alterations in respiratory surfaces. POEA use has increased recently with the advent of “Roundup-Ready” crops; however, its potential effects on aquatic invertebrates are relatively unknown. The aquatic macroinvertebrate Thamnocephalus platyurus (Crustacea, Anostraca) was used to assess the acute toxicity of POEA. Three formulations of POEA consisting of a 5:1, 10:1, and 15:1 average oxide:tallowamine were used in this study. All POEA formulations were found to be extremely toxic to T. platyurus with 48-h LC50 concentrations as low as 2.01 μg/L for 15:1. POEA toxicity increased as the tallowamine chain length was reduced, whereas the oxide chain length appeared to only slightly increase toxicity. Based on these results, POEA has the potential to adversely affect aquatic organisms in areas in which it is used.</abstract>

    <title>Parasites of Winter Flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) as an Additional Bioindicator of Stress-Related Exposure to Untreated Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent: A 5-Year Field Study</title>
    <abstract>A study was conducted in a marine inlet to assess the effects of untreated discharges from a pulp and paper mill, a municipality, and industries in western Newfoundland on winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus), a fish species shown previously to be sensitive to environmental contaminants in sediment. The fish were captured by SCUBA divers about 2 km down-current from the mill discharging effluent containing resin acids, and at three reference sites 2 to 11 km away near the opposite shore, each spring in five consecutive years and the fish were necropsied on site. A total of 360 and 339 flounder were examined near the mill and references sites, respectively. Several bioindicators were used to assess fish health including parasites. More fish exhibiting external and microscopic lesions in several tissues, lower condition factors, elevated hepatosomatic index, and delayed reproductive development were observed in samples taken near the paper mill than at the reference sites. A higher prevalence of an ectoparasite, Cryptocotyle lingua, but a significantly lower mean abundance of three metazoans infecting the digestive tract was noted in fish near the mill than in the reference samples. These results, comprising abnormal fish size distribution, low body condition factor, external and internal lesions, enlarged liver, delayed gonadal development, and changes in parasitism, were stress-related, indicative of impaired health, and associated primarily with untreated discharges from the pulp and paper mill. This integrated and multidisciplinary study also provides further evidence on the use of fish parasites as a valid and an additional bioindicator in programs monitoring environmental contaminants.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of Malathion on Survival, Growth, and Food Consumption of Indian Cricket Frog (Limnonectus limnocharis) Tadpoles</title>
    <abstract>The effects of short-term exposure (28 days) of free-feeding Limnonectus limnocharis (Indian cricket frog) tadpoles to field concentrations of malathion were investigated. This frog species is a major biotic component of the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats (13°18', 75°25' and 13°22', 75°28'), where malathion (diethyl [(dimethoxy phosphino thioyl] butanediote), an organophosphate pesticide, is being used extensively. Although malathion is known to cause nonreversible acetylcholine inhibition and diminishes activity, growth and development in amphibian tadpoles, such data on Indian amphibian species are lacking. In the present study, increments in the following were used to assess such an impact: tadpole growth; increase in total length, body length, tail length, and body weight; and food consumption. The different concentrations of malathion employed were 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000 μg L-¹. Malathion exposure produced significant effects on all measured parameters. Tadpole survival decreased from 20 to 6 tadpoles, with an increase in concentration followed by a decrease in growth. Food consumption of surviving tadpoles also decreased (0.067 mg.g-¹.d-¹ to 0.0075 mg.g-¹.d-¹) with increased malathion. Decreased food consumption, growth, and development of L. limnocharis tadpoles with an increase of malathion concentration (within field concentration range) over temporal scale reveal the possible threat to this species in the agroecosystems of the Western Ghats.</abstract>

    <title>Animal Health Problems Attributed to Environmental Contamination in Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya: A Case Study on Heavy Metal Poisoning in the Waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa (Ruppel 1835)</title>
    <abstract>A study was conducted in which samples of soil, forage, as well as serum, bone, kidney, and liver of waterbuck were collected from Lake Nakuru National Park. The objective was to determine the ecosystem health status in order to establish the causes of animal health problems previously recorded in some sections of the Park. Trace element analysis in serum indicated occurrence of copper (Cu) deficiency in the north and eastern sections of the Park where mean values were marginal (range: 0.36-0.81, mean: 0.62 mg/l) compared to concentrations recorded in the western part of the Park (range: 0.69-1.48, mean: 1.22 mg/l). Bone analysis on dry matter basis (DM) indicated higher (p < 0.01) levels of cadmium (Cd, 0.437 mg/kg), fluoride (F, 3178 mg/kg), and lead (Pb, 20.62 mg/kg) in animals from the east compared to those from the west (0.002, 1492, 4.87 mg/kg, respectively), suggesting heavy exposure. In addition, samples from the east had much lower than normal calcium (Ca)-to-phosphorus (P) ratios (mean: 1.9:1) compared to those recorded in the west (2.2:1), suggesting poor bone mineralization. There was a higher concentration of Cd in the kidney (16.24 mg/kg, p < 0.05) and Pb in the liver (58.3 mg/kg, p < 0.01) in animals from the east compared to those in the west (12.92 and 36.2 mg/kg, respectively), but the converse was true of Cu. The liver Cu status was better in animals from the west with, concentrations (mean: 21.7 mg/kg) being about twice those recorded in the east (11.9 mg/kg DM). Forage analysis revealed prospects of Ca, P, and Cu deficiencies in the entire Park. However, in the northeastern section of the Park (measuring 50 ha) where waterbuck residence times are high, forage concentrations of Cd (0.31 mg/kg DM), molybdenum (Mo, 7.20 mg/kg DM), Pb (2.88 mg/kg DM), and zinc (Zn, 126 mg/kg DM) were an order of magnitude greater (p < 0.01) than the levels recorded in the rest of the Park (ranges: 0.133-0.165, 3.69-5.61, 0.485-0.621, 11.6-17.4 mg/kg DM, respectively). These disparities were attributed to a higher soil concentration of Cd (2.77 mg/kg DM), Pb (85.1 mg/k DM) and Zn (1414 mg/kg DM) in this section compared to the rest of the Park (ranges: 0.10-0.15, 5.02-6.26, 1.49-5.44 mg/kg DM, respectively), and strongly suggest heavy metal contamination as the source of animal health problems in the Park.</abstract>

    <title>Phytophthora sojae: root rot pathogen of soybean and model oomycete</title>
    <abstract>Phytophthora sojae is an oomycete pathogen of soybean, classified in the kingdom Stramenopiles. It causes 'damping off' of seedlings and root rot of older plants, with an annual cost worldwide of $1-2 billion. Owing to its economic importance, this species, along with P. infestans, has been developed as a model species for the study of oomycete plant pathogens. It is readily transformed with DNA enabling over-expression and silencing of selected genes, genetic maps have been constructed and large expressed sequence tag sequence libraries have been developed. A draft genome sequence has recently been completed. This review briefly summarizes current information about the pathogenicity, evolution, molecular biology and genomics of P. sojae. Phytophthora sojae (Kaufman & Gerdman): superkingdom Eukaryota; kingdom Stramenopila; phylum Oomycota; class Peronosporomycetidae; order Pythiales; family Pythiaceae; genus Phytophthora. Soybean is the only economically important host. Several species of lupins have also been reported as hosts. All parts of the soybean plant are susceptible to infection by P. sojae, from germinating seedlings to mature plants. In the field, P. sojae causes damping off of soybean seedlings and a root and stem rot of established plants. Leaves can be infected in the field as a result of rain splash or by deliberate inoculation in the laboratory. Damping off can affect germinating seeds or emerged seedlings and is most severe when the spring is very wet and warm (25-30 °C). Established plants can become infected when the soil is wet for extended periods, especially if the soil is poorly drained. Both the cortex and the vascular tissue are colonized by P. sojae, and the infection can spread rapidly along the vascular tissues in susceptible cultivars. http://pmgn.vbi.vt.edu, http://phytophthora.vbi.vt.edu, http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Psojae, http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Pramorum, http://www.pfgd.org, http://pamgo.vbi.vt.edu, http://soy.vbi.vt.edu, https://www.vbi.vt.edu/article/articleview/78, http://plantpath.osu.edu/faculty/dorrance.php</abstract>

    <title>Further analysis of gene-for-gene disease resistance specificity in flax</title>
    <abstract>The flax rust resistance gene L, a nucleotide binding site, leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) class of plant resistance gene, has 12 characterized alleles with different gene-for-gene resistance specificities. Here the specificities of presumptive L1, L5, L8 and L11 genomic clones are confirmed by transgenic expression. L6 and L11 differ by 33 amino acids, 32 in the LRR region and one in the C-terminal non-LRR region, and recognize unrelated avirulence proteins, AvrL567 and AvrL11, respectively. To analyse the specificity differences, 13 L6L11 recombinant genes were constructed in vitro and tested in transgenic flax for resistance to F2 progeny of rust strain CH5, in which the unlinked avirulence genes AvrL567 and AvrL11 segregate. The data show that the single C-terminal non-LRR region polymorphism is not involved in L6-L11 specificity differences, that polymorphisms necessary for specificity are spread throughout the LRR region and that some polymorphisms essential for L11 are not essential for L6. Seven 'null' recombinants expressed no resistance when tested with CH5-derived rusts. These were tested for new resistance specificities by inoculation with a strain of rust, Bs-1, which is distantly related to CH5 and which potentially carries a different range of avirulence specificities. The 'null' recombinant L6L11RV, which differs from L6 and L11 by its susceptibility to CH5, was resistant to strain Bs-1. The specificity difference is due to a reduction in the number of AvrL567 variants recognized by L6L11RV compared with L6 and not due to recognition of an unrelated Avr gene product in strain Bs-1.</abstract>

    <abstract>Leifsonia xyli ssp. xyli is the causative agent of ratoon stunting disease, a major cause of economic loss in sugarcane crops. Understanding of the biology of this pathogen has been hampered by its fastidious growth characteristics in vitro. However, the recent release of a genome sequence for this organism has allowed significant novel insights. Further to this, we have performed a bioinformatic analysis of the lipoproteins encoded in the L. xyli genome. These analyses suggest that lipoproteins represent c. 2.0% of the L. xyli predicted proteome. Functional analyses suggest that lipoproteins make an important contribution to the physiology of the pathogen and may influence its ability to cause disease in planta.</abstract>

    <title>Disease resistance to bacterial pathogens affected by the amount of ferredoxin-I protein in plants</title>
    <abstract>Ferredoxin-I (Fd-I) is a fundamental protein that is involved in several metabolic pathways. The amount of Fd-I found in plants is generally regulated by environmental stress, including biotic and abiotic events. In this study, the correlation between quantity of Fd-I and plant disease resistance was investigated. Fd-I levels were increased by inoculation with Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae but were reduced by Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora. Transgenic tobacco over-expressing Fd-I with the sense sweet pepper Fd-I gene (pflp) was resistant to E. carotovora ssp. carotovora and the saprophytic bacterium P. fluorescens. By contrast, transgenic tobacco with reduced total Fd-I and the antisense pflp gene was susceptible to E. carotovora ssp. carotovora and P. fluorescens. Both of these transgenic tobaccos were resistant to P. syringae pv. syringae. By contrast, the mutated E. carotovora ssp. carotovora, with a defective harpin protein, was able to invade the sense-pflp transgenic tobacco as well as the non-transgenic tobacco. An in vitro kinase assay revealed that harpin could activate unidentified kinases to phosphorylate PFLP. These results demonstrate that Fd-I plays an important role in the disease defence mechanism.</abstract>

    <title>Histochemical and genetic analysis of host and non-host interactions of Arabidopsis with three Botrytis species: an important role for cell death control</title>
    <abstract>Susceptibility was evaluated of host and non-host plants to three pathogenic Botrytis species: the generalist B. cinerea and the specialists B. elliptica (lily) and B. tulipae (tulip). B. tulipae was, unexpectedly, able to infect plant species other than tulip, and to a similar extent as B. cinerea. To study host and non-host interactions in more detail, the three Botrytis species were inoculated on Arabidopsis wild-types and 23 mutant genotypes. Disease development was monitored macroscopically by quantifying the lesion area and microscopically by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy following histochemical staining. B. cinerea and B. tulipae were very similar in their ability to infect the tested Arabidopsis genotypes, whereas B. elliptica caused disease only on a few Arabidopsis mutant genotypes. Arabidopsis mutants with a delayed or reduced cell death response were generally more resistant to Botrytis infection, whereas mutants in which cell death was accelerated were more susceptible. Differences in susceptibility between genotypes were generally gradual. Only the camalexin-deficient mutant pad3 was fully susceptible to all three Botrytis species. Cellular changes were monitored during compatible and incompatible interactions. The formation of papillae, the presence of lysosome-like vesicles and the intracellular accumulation of H₂O₂ and nitric oxide were visualized in the infection zones using fluorescent probes. Based on histology and responses of Arabidopsis mutants, a model is proposed in which resistance against Botrytis, besides the production of camalexin, depends on the balance between cell death and survival.</abstract>

    <title>Analyses of the secretomes of Erwinia amylovora and selected hrp mutants reveal novel type III secreted proteins and an effect of HrpJ on extracellular harpin levels</title>
    <abstract>Erwinia amylovora is a plant pathogenic enterobacterium that causes fire blight disease of apple, pear and other rosaceous plants. A type III (T3) secretion system, encoded by clustered, chromosomal hrp genes (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity), is essential for infection, but only a few proteins are known that are secreted through this pathway (the T3 'secretome'). We developed an efficient protocol for purification and concentration of extracellular proteins and used it to characterize the T3 secretome of E. amylovora Ea273 by comparing preparations from the wild-type strain with those from mutants defective in hrp secretion, regulation, or in genes encoding putative T3-secreted proteins. Proteins were resolved by gel electrophoresis and identified using mass spectrometry and a draft sequence of the E. amylovora genome. Twelve T3-secreted proteins were identified, including homologues of known effector and helper proteins, and HrpJ, a homologue of YopN of Yersinia pestis. Several previously uncharacterized T3-secreted proteins were designated as Eops for Erwinia outer proteins. Analysis of the secretome of a non-polar hrpJ mutant demonstrated that HrpJ is required for accumulation of wild-type levels of secreted harpins. HrpJ was found to be essential for pathogenesis, and to play a major role in elicitation of the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco.</abstract>

    <title>Detection of Carbon Stock Change in Agricultural Soils Using Spectroscopic Techniques</title>
    <abstract>Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents one of the major pools in the global C cycle. Therefore, even small changes in SOC stocks cause important CO₂ fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. However, SOC stocks are difficult to quantify accurately due to their high spatial variability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of Imaging Spectroscopy (IS) using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI; 405-950 nm) and field spectroscopy with an Analytical Spectral Devices spectrometer (ASD; 350-2500 nm) to measure SOC content in heterogeneous agricultural soils. We used both stepwise and partial least square (PLS) regression analysis to relate spectral measurements to SOC contents. Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) for the ASD ranged from 2.4 to 3.3 g C kg⁻¹ depending on soil moisture content of the surface layer. Imaging spectroscopy performed poorly, mainly due to the narrow spectral range of the CASI. Tests using both the CASI and the Shortwave infrared Airborne Spectrographic Imager (SASI; 900-2500 nm) showed better results. The variation in soil texture and soil moisture content degrades the spectral response to SOC contents. Currently, SEP allows to detect a SOC stock change of 7.2-9.9 Mg C ha⁻¹ in the upper 30 cm of the soil, and is therefore still somewhat high in comparison with changes in SOC stocks as a result of management or land conversion (0.3-1.9 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). A detailed SOC maps produced by IS reflected the patterns in SOC contents due to the recent conversion from grassland to cropland.</abstract>

    <title>Estimating Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity In Spatially Variable Fields Using Neural Network Ensembles</title>
    <abstract>Modeling contaminant and water flow through soil requires accurate estimates of soil hydraulic properties in field scale. Although artificial neural networks (ANNs) based pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been successfully adopted in modeling soil hydraulic properties at larger scales (national, continental, and intercontinental), the utility of ANNs in modeling saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(s)) at a smaller (field) scale has rarely been reported. Hence, the objectives of this study are (i) to investigate the applicability of neural networks in estimating K(s) at field scales, (ii) to compare the performance of the field-scale PTFs with the published neural networks program Rosetta, and (iii) to compare the performance of two different ensemble methods, namely Bagging and Boosting in estimating K(s). Datasets from two distinct sites are considered in the study. The performances of the models were evaluated when only sand, silt, and clay content (SSC) were used as inputs, and when SSC and bulk density rho(b) (SSC+ rho(b)) were used as inputs. For both datasets, the field scale models performed better than Rosetta. The comparison of field-scale ANN models employing bagging and boosting algorithms indicates that the neural network model employing the boosting algorithm results in better generalization by reducing both the bias and variance of the neural network models.</abstract>

    <title>Impact of Climate Change on Indian Agriculture: A Review</title>
    <abstract>During the recent decade, with the growing recognition of the possibility of climate change and clear evidence of observed changes in climate during 20th century, an increasing emphasis on food security and its regional impacts has come to forefront of the scientific community. In recent times, the crop simulation models have been used extensively to study the impact of climate change on agricultural production and food security. The output provided by the simulation models can be used to make appropriate crop management decisions and to provide farmers and others with alternative options for their farming system. It is expected that in the coming decades with the increased use of computers, the use of simulation models by farmers and professionals as well as policy and decision makers will increase. In India, substantial work has been done in last decade aimed at understanding the nature and magnitude of change in yield of different crops due to projected climate change. This paper presents an overview of the state of the knowledge of possible effect of the climate variability and change on food grain production in India.</abstract>

    <title>Growth, Nodulation and Mycorrhizal Colonization in Bean Plants Improved by Rhizobial Inoculation with Organic and Chemical Fertilization.</title>
    <abstract>The poor nutrition of organic crops during the early growth stage has frequently resulted in a low productivity. Nutrients from organic fertilizers are not available to crops unless they are mineralized and a low microbial population can further delay the decomposition processes. We hypothesized that increasing microbial population, such as rhizobia in the rhizosphere of the organic crops might offset the problem of low productivity by increasing the rate of mineralization of organic fertilizers. Accordingly, the current study was aimed at evaluating the responses of potted beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cultivar Hoseki) to rhizobial (Rhizobium leguminosarum cv Phaseoli) inoculation in organically fertilized (OF) and chemically fertilized (CF) normal soils. Inoculation resulted in a significant increase in the pod yield (P < 0.05) with organic fertilizer, yet not with chemical fertilizer. Inoculation did not increase the shoot and root dry masses in the CF plants, yet did increase the shoot dry mass in the OF plants. Inoculation positively influenced nodulation in both the OF and CF plants, and the effect was more pronounced in the OF plants. The Arbuscular Mycorrhizal infection rates and frequency of arbuscule formation were always higher in the OF plants than in the CF plants, and moreover, the inoculation increased AM infectivity in the OF plants but not in the CF plants. The inoculated OF plants had more shoot N and P compared to un-inoculated plants, while the CF plants were unaffected. Interestingly, AM infection rates showed a significant positive correlation to the shoot P or N in the OF plants, yet the relation was not significant in the CF plants, indicating greater dependency of organic plants than the chemical plants on the symbiotic fungi. Therefore, the present results demonstrate importance of rhizobial inocula as a potential biofertilizer in organic farming.</abstract>

    <title>Arctic climate change with a 2 [composite function (small circle)]C global warming: Timing, climate patterns and vegetation change</title>
    <abstract>The signatories to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are charged with stabilizing the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous interference with the climate system. A number of nations, organizations and scientists have suggested that global mean temperature should not rise over 2 [composite function (small circle)]C above preindustrial levels. However, even a relatively moderate target of 2 [composite function (small circle)]C has serious implications for the Arctic, where temperatures are predicted to increase at least 1.5 to 2 times as fast as global temperatures. High latitude vegetation plays a significant role in the lives of humans and animals, and in the global energy balance and carbon budget. These ecosystems are expected to be among the most strongly impacted by climate change over the next century. To investigate the potential impact of stabilization of global temperature at 2 [composite function (small circle)]C, we performed a study using data from six Global Climate Models (GCMs) forced by four greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, the BIOME4 biogeochemistry-biogeography model, and remote sensing data. GCM data were used to predict the timing and patterns of Arctic climate change under a global mean warming of 2 [composite function (small circle)]C. A unified circumpolar classification recognizing five types of tundra and six forest biomes was used to develop a map of observed Arctic vegetation. BIOME4 was used to simulate the vegetation distributions over the Arctic at the present and for a range of 2 [composite function (small circle)]C global warming scenarios. The GCMs simulations indicate that the earth will have warmed by 2 [composite function (small circle)]C relative to preindustrial temperatures by between 2026 and 2060, by which stage the area-mean annual temperature over the Arctic (60-90[composite function (small circle)]N) will have increased by between 3.2 and 6.6 [composite function (small circle)]C. Forest extent is predicted by BIOME4 to increase in the Arctic on the order of 3 x 10⁶ km² or 55% with a corresponding 42% reduction in tundra area. Tundra types generally also shift north with the largest reductions in the prostrate dwarf-shrub tundra, where nearly 60% of habitat is lost. Modeled shifts in the potential northern limit of trees reach up to 400 km from the present tree line, which may be limited by dispersion rates. Simulated physiological effects of the CO₂ increase (to ca. 475 ppm) at high latitudes were small compared with the effects of the change in climate. The increase in forest area of the Arctic could sequester 600 Pg of additional carbon, though this effect is unlikely to be realized over next century.</abstract>

    <title>Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture: A Case of Study of Coffee Production in Veracruz, Mexico</title>
    <abstract>This paper explores the relation between coffee production and climatic and economic variables in Veracruz in order to estimate the potential impacts of climate change. For this purpose, an econometric model is developed in terms of those variables. The model is validated by means of statistical analysis, and then used to project coffee production under different climatic conditions. Climate change scenarios are produced considering that the observed trends of climate variables will continue to prevail until the year 2020. An approach for constructing simple probability scenarios for future climate variability is presented and used to assess possible impacts of climate change beyond what is expected from changes in mean values. The model shows that temperature is the most relevant climatic factor for coffee production, since production responds significantly to seasonal temperature patterns. The results for the projected climate change conditions for year 2020 indicate that coffee production might not be economically viable for producers, since the model indicates a reduction of 34% of the current production. Although different economic variables (the state and international coffee prices, a producer price index for raw materials for coffee benefit, the national and the USA coffee stocks) were considered as potentially relevant, our model suggests that the state real minimum wage could be regarded as the most important economic variable. Real minimum wage is interpreted here as a proxy for the price of labor employed for coffee production. This activity in Mexico is very labor intensive representing up to 80% of coffee production costs. As expected, increments in the price of such an important production factor increase production costs and have strong negative effects on production. Different assumptions on how real minimum wage could evolve for the year 2020 are considered for developing future production scenarios.</abstract>

    <title>Increasing Aridity is Enhancing Silver Fir Abies Alba Mill.) Water Stress in its South-Western Distribution Limit</title>
    <abstract>Tree populations located at the geographical distribution limit of the species may provide valuable information about the response of tree growth to climate warming across climatic gradients. Dendroclimatic information was extracted from a network of 10 silver-fir (Abies alba) populations in the south-western distribution limit of the species (Pyrenees, NE Iberian Peninsula). Ring-width chronologies were built for five stands sampled in mesic sites from the Main Range in the Pyrenees, and for five forests located in the southern Peripheral Ranges where summer drought is more pronounced. The radial growth of silver-fir in this region is constrained by water stress during the summer previous to growth, as suggested by the negative relationship with previous September temperature and, to a lesser degree, by a positive relationship with previous end of summer precipitation. Climatic data showed a warming trend since the 1970s across the Pyrenees, with more severe summer droughts. The recent warming changed the climate-growth relationships, causing higher growth synchrony among sites, and a higher year-to-year growth variation, especially in the southernmost forests. Moving-interval response functions suggested an increasing water-stress effect on radial growth during the last half of the 20th century. The growth period under water stress has extended from summer up to early autumn. Forests located in the southern Peripheral Ranges experienced a more intense water stress, as seen in a shift of their response to precipitation and temperature. The Main-Range sites mainly showed a response to warming. The intensification of water-stress during the late 20th century might affect the future growth performance of the highly-fragmented A. alba populations in the southwestern distribution limit of the species.</abstract>

    <title>Regionally optimized forest management under changing climate</title>
    <abstract>The purpose of this study was to optimize forest management for a forest region (the total area of forest and scrub land 1.54 mill. ha) under changing climate by using the large-scale forestry scenario model MELA and sample plot data from the geo-referenced National Forest Inventory (NFI). The MELA model is based on integrated simulation and optimisation; in the simulation it utilises empirical tree-level models into which the impacts of climate change were introduced by transfer variables derived by using the physiological model FinnFor. Six scenarios with differences in climate and forest management were defined. In simulations, the accelerating tree growth caused by climate change resulted in an increase in maximum sustainable removal of trees at regional level. Changes in regionally optimized forest management were also detected during the analysis period of 30 years; the proportion of thinnings increased because the stands fulfilled the thinning requirements earlier than in the current climate. This study was the first attempt to solve endogenously maximum sustainable timber production and corresponding forest management at the regional level under different climate scenarios. When implemented in the MELA system, which is widely used in Finnish forestry, the transfer variables offer means of disseminating the results from physiological studies to planning of adjustment and mitigation measures under changing climate.</abstract>

    <title>Simulation of long-term future climate changes with the green McGill paleoclimate model: the next glacial inception</title>
    <abstract>The multi-component “green” McGill Paleoclimate Model (MPM), which includes interactive vegetation, is used to simulate the next glacial inception under orbital and prescribed atmospheric CO₂ forcing. This intermediate complexity model is first run for short-term periods with an increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentration; the model's response is in general agreement with the results of GCMs for CO₂ doubling. The green MPM is then used to derive projections of the climate for the next 100 kyr. Under a constant CO₂ level, the model produces three types of evolution for the ice volume: an imminent glacial inception (low CO₂ levels), a glacial inception in 50 kyr (CO₂ levels of 280 or 290 ppm), or no glacial inception during the next 100 kyr (CO₂ levels of 300 ppm and higher). This high sensitivity to the CO₂ level is due to the exceptionally weak future variations of the summer insolation at high northern latitudes. The changes in vegetation re-inforce the buildup of ice sheets after glacial inception. Finally, if an initial global warming episode of finite duration is included, after which the atmospheric CO₂ level is assumed to stabilize at 280, 290 or 300 ppm, the impact of this warming is seen only in the first 5 kyr of the run; after this time the response is insensitive to the early warming perturbation.</abstract>

    <title>The 1920S Drought Recorded by Tree Rings and Historical Documents in the Semi-Arid and Arid Areas of Northern China</title>
    <abstract>Using a network of tree-ring data, we show that there had been significant growth decline in the 1920s and early 1930s throughout a wide area of northern China. This growth depression is indicative of a severe and sustained drought in the 1920s and early 1930s, which was then confirmed with a variety of historical and instrumental records including hydrological, meteorological, and documentary evidence. The 1920s drought had a devastating effect not only on agricultural productivity, hydrological resources and society in the affected areas, but also on natural vegetation, as inferred from the tree-ring network and historical records. This research offers a picture of the drought calamity during the 1920s and early 1930s in northern China, and demonstrates the potential to identify spatial anomalies of large-scale drought using tree-ring networks in the semi-arid and arid areas of northern China.</abstract>

    <title>Abatement of Greenhouse Gases: Does Location Matter</title>
    <abstract>Today's climate policy is based on the assumption that the location of emissions reductions has no impact on the overall climate effect. However, this may not be the case since reductions of greenhouse gases generally will lead to changes in emissions of short-lived gases and aerosols. Abatement measures may be primarily targeted at reducing CO₂, but may also simultaneously reduce emissions of NOx, CO, CH₄ and SO₂ and aerosols. Emissions of these species may cause significant additional radiative forcing. We have used a global 3-D chemical transport model and a radiative transfer model to study the impact on climate in terms of radiative forcing for a realistic change in location of the emissions from large-scale sources. Based on an assumed 10% reduction in CO₂ emissions, reductions in the emissions of other species have been estimated. Climate impact for the SRES A1B scenario is compared to two reduction cases, with the main focus on a case with emission reductions between 2010 and 2030, but also a case with sustained emission reductions. The emission reductions are applied to four different regions (Europe, China, South Asia, and South America). In terms of integrated radiative forcing (over 100 yr), the total effect (including only the direct effect of aerosols) is always smaller than for CO₂ alone. Large variations between the regions are found (53-86% of the CO₂ effect). Inclusion of the indirect effects of sulphate aerosols reduces the net effect of measures towards zero. The global temperature responses, calculated with a simple energy balance model, show an initial additional warming of different magnitude between the regions followed by a more uniform reduction in the warming later. A major part of the regional differences can be attributed to differences related to aerosols, while ozone and changes in methane lifetime make relatively small contributions. Emission reductions in a different sector (e.g. transportation instead of large-scale sources) might change this conclusion since the NOx to SO₂ ratio in the emissions is significantly higher for transportation than for large-scale sources. The total climate effect of abatement measures thus depends on (i) which gases and aerosols are affected by the measure, (ii) the lifetime of the measure implemented, (iii) time horizon over which the effects are considered, and (iv) the chemical, physical and meteorological conditions in the region. There are important policy implications of the results. Equal effects of a measure cannot be assumed if the measure is implemented in a different region and if several gases are affected. Thus, the design of emission reduction measures should be considered thoroughly before implementation.</abstract>

    <title>The Enso-Fire Dynamic in Insular Southeast Asia</title>
    <abstract>We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of fire in insular Southeast Asia from July 1996 to December 2001 using a set of consistent, nighttime fire observations provided by the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) sensor. Monthly ATSR fire counts were analyzed relative to georeferenced climatic and land-cover data from a variety of sources. We found that fires were strongly correlated with Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (r = -0.75) and Niño 3.4 index (r = 0.72) in forested land-cover types within the equatorial belt (5.5[composite function (small circle)]S-5.5[composite function (small circle)]N). Cross-correlation analysis revealed that detrended SOI was modestly correlated (r = 0.42) with detrended monthly fire count with a positive lag of four months. However, our analysis also revealed that fire counts reached their maximum 6 months before the absolute maximum of SOI. Annual sums of SOI ([summation operator]SOI) and fire counts revealed linearity for [summation operator]SOI<= 0. Overall, the results suggest that ENSO indices may have limited predictive utility at a monthly time scale, but that temporal aggregation and additional fire observations may enhance our capacity to forecast fires in different cover types based on ENSO data.</abstract>

    <title>Trends in Precipitation Concentration and Extremes in the Mediterranean Penedès-Anoia Region, Ne Spain</title>
    <abstract>The high variability of the Mediterranean climate from year to year and within each year makes it difficult to assess changes that could be associated with a climate change. In this paper some indices, such as changes in the precipitation concentration during the year, maximum 1-day and 5-day precipitation, number of wet days (total and those with precipitation higher than the 75th and 95th percentile), magnitude and frequency of extreme events (considered as the rainfall higher than that corresponding to the 99th percentile), fraction of annual total precipitation due to events exceeding the 95th and 99th percentile, strength of the events, and length and frequency of dry period (days between consecutive rains) are evaluated for the Penedès-Anoia region (NE Spain). A 80-year daily dataset (1923-2002) and two 40-year series were used to assess possible trends. The indices indicate an increase in precipitation in winter and summer and a positive trend of concentration in autumn, with a higher number of extreme events separated by longer dry periods. The total number of wet days per year increased, although it was irregularly distributed over the year, with an increase in the extremes and in the fraction of total rainfall that these events represent in autumn and winter, and with an increase of the strength of the events in autumn. These changes in rainfall distribution have negative effects on water availability for crops and contribute to accelerate erosion processes in the area.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Water Supply and Flood Hazard in Ireland Using Statistical Downscaling and Hydrological Modelling Techniques</title>
    <abstract>Estimates are made of changes in effective runoff at a high spatial resolution for the island of Ireland under different climate change scenarios. The first part of the investigation examines changes in annual and seasonal effective runoff for the whole land area of Ireland. The rainfall-runoff model HYSIM is used to carry out the hydrological simulations. The output from the HadCM3 Global Climate Model (GCM) is downscaled using statistical techniques to provide precipitation and evaporation data at a 10 km x 10 km resolution; this data is then used to drive the HYSIM model. Simulations are carried out for each of the 825 10 km x 10 km grid cells covering Ireland for the baseline period (1961-1990) and two future scenarios; 2041-2070 and 2061-2090. Parameter values are derived for each square using data from the Soil Survey of Ireland and the CORINE land use database and validation is carried out for selected catchments. The results of these simulations indicate a decrease in annual runoff that is most marked in the east and southeast of the country, whereas an increase is likely for the extreme northwest. The reduction in effective runoff for the east of the country is particularly marked during the summer months. It is these areas that have highest population density and also where greatest population growth is likely to occur. During the winter months an increase in effective runoff is suggested for the western half of country which could have implications for flood frequency, as well as the extent and duration of winter flooding.</abstract>

    <title>Tree-Ring Reconstructed Maize Yield in Central Mexico: 1474-2001</title>
    <abstract>Maize was domesticated more than 6,000 years ago in central Mexico, and remains a vital staple food and cultural symbol in Mesoamerica. Maize yield in the central highlands is strongly dependant on adequate rainfall early in the growing season (April-June) because late maturation of the crop may result in damage from autumn frost. Climate-induced crop failures with profound socioeconomic impacts have punctuated Mexican history. However, reliable records of maize harvest have not been available until very recently, and historical records of crop yield and price are discontinuous and can be difficult to interpret. We have developed a continuous, exactly dated, tree-ring reconstruction of maize yield variability in central Mexico from 1474 to 2001 that provides new insight into the history of climate and food availability in the heartland of the Mesoamerican cultural province. The reconstruction indicates that seven of the most severe agricultural crises in Mexican history occurred during decadal-scale episodes of reconstructed maize shortfalls.</abstract>

    <title>Seasonal Climate Forecasts - Potential Agricultural-Risk Management Tools</title>
    <abstract>The importance of anchoring seasonal climate forecasts to user needs is examined in this paper. Although it is generally accepted that seasonal climate forecasts have potential value, many constraints preclude the optimal use of these forecasts, including the way forecasts are produced, interpreted and applied in a variety of decision-making processes. In South Africa, a variety of agricultural users exists, ranging from the small-scale farmer to larger commercial farming entities. Useful seasonal are those produced and disseminated with the end user in mind. A retroactive test period during the 1990s, evaluates the perceived impact of incorporating seasonal rainfall forecasts into decisions made by commercial crop farmers in the central parts of South Africa. Although a small sample of commercial farmers was interviewed, the results show some benefits to commercial agriculture if seasonal climate forecast information is continuously and effectively applied over the long-term.</abstract>

    <title>Gradient-based estimation of local parameters for flow and transport in heterogeneous porous media.</title>
    <abstract>We present the application of the gradient-based total least squares (TLS) method to the local estimation of parameters for flow and transport in porous media. The concept is based on the evaluation of partial derivatives of spatially and temporally resolved data using TLS as a maximum likelihood estimator. While ordinary inverse modeling approaches are often complicated by the spatially varying properties of porous media, the present approach can directly localize the estimation to an arbitrary range in space and time. The estimation of the local parameters can be achieved without requiring any explicit solution of the respective transport equation. First the basic ideas and the formalism of TLS are introduced with a simple example of a straight line fit. Then the ideas of the gradient-based approach and its application to the parameter estimation for a large class of dynamic processes are presented. We further discuss relevant computational issues such as the calculation of the derivatives, choice of the local neighborhood and the determination of a measure of confidence. The performance of the method is then exemplified by the estimation of local velocities and dispersion coefficients from numerical solutions of the convection-dispersion equation.</abstract>

    <title>A 1052-year tree-ring proxy for Alpine summer temperatures.</title>
    <abstract>A June-August Alpine temperature proxy series is developed back to AD 951 using 1,527 ring-width measurements from living trees and relict wood. The reconstruction is composed of larch data from four Alpine valleys in Switzerland and pine data from the western Austrian Alps. These regions are situated in high elevation Alpine environments where a spatially homogenous summer temperature signal exists. In an attempt to capture the full frequency range of summer temperatures over the past millennium, from inter-annual to multi-centennial scales, the regional curve standardization technique is applied to the ring width measurements. Correlations of 0.65 and 0.86 after decadal smoothing, with high elevation meteorological stations since 1864 indicate an optimal response of the RCS chronology to June-August mean temperatures. The proxy record reveals warm conditions from before AD 1000 into the thirteenth century, followed by a prolonged cool period, reaching minimum values in the 1820s, and a warming trend into the twentieth century. This latter trend and the higher frequency variations compare well with the actual high elevation temperature record. The new central Alpine proxy suggests that summer temperatures during the last decade are unprecedented over the past millennium. It also reveals significant similarities at inter-decadal to multi-centennial frequencies with large-scale temperature reconstructions, however, deviating during certain periods from H.H. Lamb's European/North Atlantic temperature history.</abstract>

    <title>Palaeoprecipitation reconstruction by inverse modelling using the isotopic signal of loess organic matter: application to the Nußloch loess sequence (Rhine Valley, Germany).</title>
    <abstract>A modified version of the Biome4 vegetation model for simulation of the mean δ¹³C of plant communities is presented, and used to reconstruct palaeoprecipitation. We treat all fractionations by C3 and C4 plants in all coexistent Plant Functional Types, weighted by their respective net primary production. We constrain the range of variation in the intracellular versus atmospheric CO₂ concentration by fixing a lower limit. Finally, we replace some constant parameters by functions of external forcing to account for their responses to environmental variation. The new version of Biome4 was applied as an inverse model and tested on three modern data sets. The fit between observations and simulations is very close to the 1:1 relationship, with respective slopes of 0.90±0.02 (r ²=0.98, n=29) for δ¹³C and 0.97±0.06 (r ²=0.90, n=29) for precipitation. Inverse modelling was applied using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to the Nußloch loess sequence. Over the last glaciation, simulated palaeoprecipitation varies between 240 mm year-¹ and 400 mm year-¹. This study clearly demonstrates atmospheric teleconnections with the Greenland ice-sheet extension, by matching Dansgaard-Oeschger events with precipitation increase of ca. 100-200 mm year-¹.</abstract>

    <title>Climate sensitivity to tropical land surface changes with coupled versus prescribed SSTs.</title>
    <abstract>Tropical land cover change experiments with fixed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and with an interactive ocean are compared to assess the relevance of including the ocean system in sensitivity studies to land surface conditions. The results show that the local response to deforestation is similar with fixed and simulated SSTs. Over Amazonia, all experiments simulate a comparable decrease in precipitation and no change in moisture convergence, implying that there is only a change in local water recycling. Over Africa, the impact on precipitation is not identical for all experiments; however, the signal is smaller than over Amazonia and simulations of more than 50 years would be necessary to statistically discriminate the precipitation change. We observe small but significant changes in SSTs in the coupled simulation in the tropical oceans surrounding the deforested regions. Impacts on mid and high latitudes SSTs are also possible. As remote impacts to deforestation are weak, it has not been possible to establish possible oceanic feedbacks to the atmosphere. Overall, this study indicates that the oceanic feedback to land surface sensitivity studies is of second importance, and that the inclusion of the oceanic system will require ensembles of long climate simulations to properly take into account the low frequency variability of the ocean.</abstract>

    <title>Impact of vegetation changes on the dynamics of the atmosphere at the Last Glacial Maximum.</title>
    <abstract>Much work is under way to identify and quantify the feedbacks between vegetation and climate. Palaeoclimate modelling may provide a mean to address this problem by comparing simulations with proxy data. We have performed a series of four simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) using the climate model HadSM3, to test the sensitivity of climate to various changes in vegetation: a global change (according to a previously discussed simulation of the LGM with HadSM3 coupled to the dynamical vegetation model TRIFFID); a change only north of 35°N; a change only south of 35°N; and a variation in stomatal opening induced by the reduction in atmospheric CO₂ concentration. We focus mainly on the response of temperature, precipitation, and atmosphere dynamics. The response of continental temperature and precipitation mainly results from regional interactions with vegetation. In Eurasia, particularly Siberia and Tibet, the response of the biosphere substantially enhances the glacial cooling through a positive feedback loop between vegetation, temperature, and snow-cover. In central Africa, the decrease in tree fraction reduces the amount of precipitation. Stomatal opening is not seen to play a quantifiable role. The atmosphere dynamics, and more specifically the Asian summer monsoon system, are significantly altered by remote changes in vegetation: the cooling in Siberia and Tibet act in concert to shift the summer subtropical front southwards, weaken the easterly tropical jet and the momentum transport associated with it. By virtue of momentum conservation, these changes in the mid-troposphere circulation are associated with a slowing of the Asian summer monsoon surface flow. The pattern of moisture convergence is slightly altered, with moist convection weakening in the western tropical Pacific and strengthening north of Australia.</abstract>

    <title>Simulated changes in vegetation distribution, land carbon storage, and atmospheric CO₂ in response to a collapse of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation</title>
    <abstract>It is investigated how abrupt changes in the North Atlantic (NA) thermohaline circulation (THC) affect the terrestrial carbon cycle. The Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model is forced with climate perturbations from glacial freshwater experiments with the ECBILT-CLIO ocean-atmosphere-sea ice model. A reorganisation of the marine carbon cycle is not addressed. Modelled NA THC collapses and recovers after about a millennium in response to prescribed freshwater forcing. The initial cooling of several Kelvin over Eurasia causes a reduction of extant boreal and temperate forests and a decrease in carbon storage in high northern latitudes, whereas improved growing conditions and slower soil decomposition rates lead to enhanced storage in mid-latitudes. The magnitude and evolution of global terrestrial carbon storage in response to abrupt THC changes depends sensitively on the initial climate conditions. These were varied using results from time slice simulations with the Hadley Centre model HadSM3 for different periods over the past 21 kyr. Changes in terrestrial storage vary between -67 and +50 PgC for the range of experiments with different initial conditions. Simulated peak-to-peak differences in atmospheric CO₂ are 6 and 13 ppmv for glacial and late Holocene conditions. Simulated changes in δ¹³C are between 0.15 and 0.25[per thousand]. These simulated carbon storage anomalies during a NA THC collapse depend on their magnitude on the CO₂ fertilisation feedback mechanism. The CO₂ changes simulated for glacial conditions are compatible with available evidence from marine studies and the ice core CO₂ record. The latter shows multi-millennial CO₂ variations of up to 20 ppmv broadly in parallel with the Antarctic warm events A1 to A4 in the South and cooling in the North.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study examines the impact of greenhouse gas warming on soil moisture based on predictions of 15 global climate models by comparing the after-stabilization climate in the SRESA1b experiment with the pre-industrial control climate. The models are consistent in predicting summer dryness and winter wetness in only part of the northern middle and high latitudes. Slightly over half of the models predict year-round wetness in central Eurasia and/or year-round dryness in Siberia and mid-latitude Northeast Asia. One explanation is offered that relates such lack of seasonality to the carryover effect of soil moisture storage from season to season. In the tropics and subtropics, a decrease of soil moisture is the dominant response. The models are especially consistent in predicting drier soil over the southwest North America, Central America, the Mediterranean, Australia, and the South Africa in all seasons, and over much of the Amazon and West Africa in the June-July-August (JJA) season and the Asian monsoon region in the December-January-February (DJF) season. Since the only major areas of future wetness predicted with a high level of model consistency are part of the northern middle and high latitudes during the non-growing season, it is suggested that greenhouse gas warming will cause a worldwide agricultural drought. Over regions where there is considerable consistency among the analyzed models in predicting the sign of soil moisture changes, there is a wide range of magnitudes of the soil moisture response, indicating a high degree of model dependency in terrestrial hydrological sensitivity. A major part of the inter-model differences in the sensitivity of soil moisture response are attributable to differences in land surface parameterization.</abstract>

    <title>Coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation simulations for modern and mid-Holocene climates: role of extratropical vegetation cover feedbacks</title>
    <abstract>A full global atmosphere-ocean-land vegetation model is used to examine the coupled climate/vegetation changes in the extratropics between modern and mid-Holocene (6,000 year BP) times and to assess the feedback of vegetation cover changes on the climate response. The model produces a relatively realistic natural vegetation cover and a climate sensitivity comparable to that realized in previous studies. The simulated mid-Holocene climate led to an expansion of boreal forest cover into polar tundra areas (mainly due to increased summer/fall warmth) and an expansion of middle latitude grass cover (due to a combination of enhanced temperature seasonality with cold winters and interior drying of the continents). The simulated poleward expansion of boreal forest and middle latitude expansion of grass cover are consistent with previous modeling studies. The feedback effect of expanding boreal forest in polar latitudes induced a significant spring warming and reduced snow cover that partially countered the response produced by the orbitally induced changes in radiative forcing. The expansion of grass cover in middle latitudes worked to reinforce the orbital forcing by contributing a spring cooling, enhanced snow cover, and a delayed soil water input by snow melt. Locally, summer rains tended to increase (decrease) in areas with greatest tree cover increases (decreases); however, for the broad-scale polar and middle latitude domains the climate responses produced by the changes in vegetation are relatively much smaller in summer/fall than found in previous studies. This study highlights the need to develop a more comprehensive strategy for investigating vegetation feedbacks.</abstract>

    <title>A comparison of a GCM response to historical anthropogenic land cover change and model sensitivity to uncertainty in present-day land cover representations</title>
    <abstract>This study assesses the sensitivity of the fully coupled NCAR-DOE PCM to three different representations of present-day land cover, based on IPCC SRES land cover information. We conclude that there is significant model sensitivity to current land cover characterization, with an observed average global temperature range of 0.21 K between the simulations. Much larger contrasts (up to 5 K) are found on the regional scale; however, these changes are largely offsetting on the global scale. These results show that significant biases can be introduced when outside data sources are used to conduct anthropogenic land cover change experiments in GCMs that have been calibrated to their own representation of present-day land cover. We conclude that hybrid systems that combine the natural vegetation from the native GCM datasets combined with human land cover information from other sources are best for simulating such impacts. We also performed a prehuman simulation, which had a 0.39 K ~higher average global temperature and, perhaps of greater importance, temperature changes regionally of about 2 K. In this study, the larger regional changes coincide with large-scale agricultural areas. The initial cooling from energy balance changes appear to create feedbacks that intensify mid-latitude circulation features and weaken the summer monsoon circulation over Asia, leading to further cooling. From these results, we conclude that land cover change plays a significant role in anthropogenically forced climate change. Because these changes coincide with regions of the highest human population this climate impact could have a disproportionate impact on human systems. Therefore, it is important that land cover change be included in past and future climate change simulations.</abstract>

    <title>Quantitative reconstruction of the last interglacial vegetation and climate based on the pollen record from Lake Baikal, Russia</title>
    <abstract>Changes in mean temperature of the coldest (T c) and warmest month (T w), annual precipitation (P ann) and moisture index (α) were reconstructed from a continuous pollen record from Lake Baikal, Russia. The pollen sequence CON01-603-2 (53°57'N, 108°54'E) was recovered from a 386 m water depth in the Continent Ridge and dated to ca. 130-114.8 ky BP. This time interval covers the complete last interglacial (LI), corresponding to MIS 5e. Results of pollen analysis and pollen-based quantitative biome reconstruction show pronounced changes in the regional vegetation throughout the record. Shrubby tundra covered the area at the beginning of MIS 5e (ca. 130-128 ky), consistent with the end of the Middle Pleistocene glaciation. The late glacial climate was characterised by low winter and summer temperatures (T c ~ -38 to -35°C and T w~11-13°C) and low annual precipitation (P ann~300 mm). However, the wide spread of tundra vegetation suggests rather moist environments associated with low temperatures and evaporation (reconstructed α~1). Tundra was replaced by boreal conifer forest (taiga) by ca. 128 ky BP, suggesting a transition to the interglacial. Taiga-dominant phase lasted until ca. 117.4 ky BP, e.g. about 10 ky. The most favourable climate conditions occurred during the first half of the LI. P ann reached 500 mm soon after 128 ky BP. However, temperature changed more gradually. Maximum values of T c ~ -20°C and T w~16-17°C are reconstructed from about 126 ky BP. Conditions became gradually colder after ca. 121 ky BP. T c dropped to ~ -27°C and T w to ~15°C by 119.5 ky BP. The reconstructed increase in continentality was accompanied by a decrease in P ann to ~400-420 mm. However, the climate was still humid enough (α~0.9) to support growth of boreal evergreen conifers. A sharp turn towards a dry climate is reconstructed after ca. 118 ky BP, causing retreat of forest and spread of cool grass-shrub communities. Cool steppe dominated the vegetation in the area between ca. 117.5 ky and 114.8 ky BP, suggesting the end of the interglacial and transition to the last glacial (MIS 5d). Shift to the new glaciation was characterised by cool and very dry conditions with T c ~ -28 to -30°C, T w~14-15°C, P ann~250 mm and α~0.5.</abstract>

    <title>Tree-ring-based hydrological records for western Himalaya, India, since a.d. 1560</title>
    <abstract>We analysed 565 increment cores from 325 Himalayan cedar [Cedrus deodara (Roxb.) G. Don] trees growing at 13 moisture-stressed, widely distributed sites in the western Himalayan region. We found a strong positive relationship between our tree-ring width chronologies and spring precipitation which enabled us to reconstruct precipitation back to a.d. 1560. This reconstruction is so far the longest in this region. The calibration model explains 40% variance in the instrumental data (1953-1997). The most striking feature of the reconstruction is the unprecedented increase in precipitation during the late twentieth century relative to the past 438 years. Both wet and dry springs occurred during the Little Ice Age. A 10-year running mean showed that the driest period occurred in the seventeenth century while the wettest period occurred in the twentieth century. Spectral analysis of the reconstructed series indicated a dominant 2-year periodicity.</abstract>

    <title>Enhanced albedo feedback in North Africa from possible combined vegetation and soil-formation processes</title>
    <abstract>It has long been recognized that albedo related vegetation feedbacks amplify climate variability in North Africa. Recent studies have revealed that areas of very high albedo associated with certain desert soil types contribute to the current dry climate of the region. We construct three scenarios of North African albedo, one based on satellite measurements, one where the highest albedo resembles that of soils in the desert transition zones, and one based on a vegetation map for the “green Sahara” state of the middle Holocene, ca. 6,000 years ago. Using a series of climate model simulations, we find that the additional amplitude of albedo change from the middle Holocene to the present caused by the very bright desert soils enhances the magnitude of the June-to-August precipitation change in the region of the present Sahara from 0.6 to 1.0 mm/day on average. We also find that albedo change has a larger effect on regional precipitation than changes in either the Earth's orbit or sea surface temperatures between 6,000 years ago and today. Simulated precipitation agrees rather well with present observations and mid Holocene reconstructions. Our results suggest that there may exist an important climate feedback from soil formation processes that has so far not been recognized.</abstract>

    <title>Butenyl-spinosyns, a natural example of genetic engineering of antibiotic biosynthetic genes</title>
    <abstract>Spinosyns, a novel class of insect active macrolides produced by Saccharopolyspora spinosa, are used for insect control in a number of commercial crops. Recently, a new class of spinosyns was discovered from S. pogona NRRL 30141. The butenyl-spinosyns, also called pogonins, are very similar to spinosyns, differing in the length of the side chain at C-21 and in the variety of novel minor factors. The butenyl-spinosyn biosynthetic genes (bus) were cloned on four cosmids covering a contiguous 110-kb region of the NRRL 30141 chromosome. Their function in butenyl-spinosyn biosynthesis was confirmed by a loss-of-function deletion, and subsequent complementation by cloned genes. The coding sequences of the butenyl-spinosyn biosynthetic genes and the spinosyn biosynthetic genes from S. spinosa were highly conserved. In particular, the PKS-coding genes from S. spinosa and S. pogona have 91-94% nucleic acid identity, with one notable exception. The butenyl-spinosyn gene sequence codes for one additional PKS module, which is responsible for the additional two carbons in the C-21 tail. The DNA sequence of spinosyn genes in this region suggested that the S. spinosa spnA gene could have been the result of an in-frame deletion of the S. pogona busA gene. Therefore, the butenyl-spinosyn genes represent the putative parental gene structure that was naturally engineered by deletion to create the spinosyn genes.</abstract>

    <title>Ammonium and urea removal by Spirulina platensis</title>
    <abstract>Different concentrations either of ammonium chloride or urea were used in batch and fed-batch cultivations of Spirulina platensis to evaluate the possibility of substituting nitrate by cheaper reduced nitrogen sources in wastewaters biotreatment. The maximum nitrogen concentration able to sustain the batch growth of this microalga without inhibition was 1.7 mM in both cases. Ammonium chloride was limiting for the growth at lower concentrations, whereas inhibition took place at higher levels. This inhibition effect was less marked with urea, likely because the enzymatic hydrolysis of this compound by urease controlled the ammonia transfer into the cell. Fed-batch experiments carried out by pulse-feeding either ammonium or urea proved that the use of these compounds as nitrogen sources can sustain the long term-cultivation of S. platensis, provided that the conditions for their feeding are accurately optimized.</abstract>

    <title>Biogeophysical effects of historical land cover changes simulated by six Earth system models of intermediate complexity</title>
    <abstract>Six Earth system models of intermediate complexity that are able to simulate interaction between atmosphere, ocean, and land surface, were forced with a scenario of land cover changes during the last millennium. In response to historical deforestation of about 18 million sq km, the models simulate a decrease in global mean annual temperature in the range of 0.13-0.25°C. The rate of this cooling accelerated during the 19th century, reached a maximum in the first half of the 20th century, and declined at the end of the 20th century. This trend is explained by temporal and spatial dynamics of land cover changes, as the effect of deforestation on temperature is less pronounced for tropical than for temperate regions, and reforestation in the northern temperate areas during the second part of the 20th century partly offset the cooling trend. In most of the models, land cover changes lead to a decline in annual land evapotranspiration, while seasonal changes are rather equivocal because of spatial shifts in convergence zones. In the future, reforestation might be chosen as an option for the enhancement of terrestrial carbon sequestration. Our study indicates that biogeophysical mechanisms need to be accounted for in the assessment of land management options for climate change mitigation.</abstract>

    <title>Controlled formation of volatile components in cider making using a combination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora valbyensis yeast species</title>
    <abstract>The effect of pure and mixed fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora valbyensis on the formation of major volatile components in cider was investigated. When the interaction between yeast strains of S. cerevisiae and H. valbyensis was studied, it was found that the two strains each affected the cell growth of the other upon inoculation of S. cerevisiae during growth of H. valbyensis. The effects of pure and mixed cultures of S. cerevisiae and H. valbyensis on alcohol fermentation and major volatile compound formation in cider were assessed. S. cerevisiae showed a conversion of sugar to alcohol of 11.5%, while H. valbyensis produced alcohol with a conversion not exceeding 6%. Higher concentrations of ethyl acetate and phenethyl acetate were obtained with H. valbyensis, and higher concentrations of isoamyl alcohol and isobutyl were formed by S. cerevisiae. Consequently, a combination of these two yeast species in sequential fermentation was used to increase the concentration of ethyl esters by 7.41-20.96%, and to decrease the alcohol concentration by 25.06-51.38%. Efficient control of the formation of volatile compounds was achieved by adjusting the inoculation time of the two yeasts.</abstract>

    <title>Inducible direct plant defense against insect herbivores: A review</title>
    <abstract>Plants respond to insect herbivory with responses broadly known as direct defenses, indirect defenses, and tolerance. Direct defenses include all plant traits that affect susceptibility of host plants by themselves. Overall categories of direct plant defenses against insect herbivores include limiting food supply, reducing nutrient value, reducing preference, disrupting physical structures, and inhibiting chemical pathways of the attacking insect. Major known defense chemicals include plant secondary metabolites, protein inhibitors of insect digestive enzymes, proteases, lectins, amino acid deaminases and oxidases. Multiple factors with additive or even synergistic impact are usually involved in defense against a specific insect species, and factors of major importance to one insect species may only be of secondary importance or not effective at all against another insect species. Extensive qualitative and quantitative high throughput analyses of temporal and spatial variations in gene expression, protein level and activity, and metabolite concentration will accelerate not only the understanding of the overall mechanisms of direct defense, but also accelerate the identification of specific targets for enhancement of plant resistance for agriculture.</abstract>

    <title>Mechanisms of resistance to spinosad in the western flower thrip, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)</title>
    <abstract>Cross-resistance, resistance mechanisms, and mode of inheritance of spinosad resistance were studied in the western flower thrip, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). Spinosad (naturalyte insecticide) showed low cross-resistance to prothiophos (organophosphorus insecticide) and chlorphenapyr (respiratory inhibitor) showed some cross-resistance to thiocyclam (nereistoxin). The synergists PBO (piperonyl butoxide), DEM (diethyl maleate), and DEF (s, s, s-tributyl phosphorotrithioate) did not show any synergism on the toxicity of spinosad in the resistant strain (ICS), indicating that metabolic-mediated detoxification was not responsible for the spinosad resistance, suggesting that spinosad may reduce sensitivity of the target site: the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and GABA receptor. Following reciprocal crosses, dose-response lines and dominance ratios indicated that spinosad resistance was incompletely dominant and there were no maternal effects. The results of backcross showed that spinosad resistance did not fit a single-gene hypothesis, suggesting that resistance was influenced by several genes.</abstract>

    <title>Effects of environmental humidity on the survival and development of pine caterpillars, Dendrolimus tabulaeformis (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae)</title>
    <abstract>The pine caterpillar, Dendrolimus tabulaeformis is one of the most important pests on Pinus tabulaeformis and other pine species in North China. In the present study, effects of relative humidity (RH) on the development and survival of pine caterpillars and soil moisture (SM) on their diapausing larvae were investigated. Low RH (20%) deferred the development of eggs and larvae, reduced egg hatching and larval surviving compared to 40%, 60% and 80% RH. Both low (20%) and high (100%) RH reduced egg hatching, but only 20% RH deferred the development of larvae, prolonged developmental duration and reduced the body mass and body length of larvae. The SM influenced the survival of diapausing larvae significantly. The dry treatment significantly reduced the supercooling points (SCPs), whereas increased the mortality and reduced body mass from 56.9 to 36.5 mg and body water content from 78% to 63% after 2 weeks' exposure. Therefore, higher RH is more favorable for the development of early instars and survival of diapausing larvae of the pine caterpillars.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing the sensitivity of Melanoplus frigidus (Orthoptera: Acrididae) to different weather conditions: A modeling approach focussing on development times</title>
    <abstract>The temperature and soil moisture conditions as well as vegetation patterns were studied to describe the habitat and to model the life cycle of Melanoplus frigidus, a true alpine grasshopper of the Scandes. In the low alpine belt of the Norwegian Scandes the species colonizes only the warmest microhabitats with maximum soil surface temperatures of 31°C. Vegetation of these habitats consists of shrub-rich heath dominated by Vaccinium myrtillus and Calluna vulgaris. Using continuously measured temperature data, the development times for four different seasons were modeled and related to field observations. The maximum delay of adult molt was estimated to amount to 3 weeks, the delay being determined by the variation in spring temperature conditions between different years. The possibilities of using M. frigidus as an indicator organism of climate change effects on alpine zoo-coenoses of the Scandes are discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Cathepsin B protease is required for metamorphism in silkworm, Bombyx mori</title>
    <abstract>Cathepsin B belongs to lysosomal cysteine protease of the papain family. Temporal and spatial expression analysis of cathepsin B of Bombyx mori (BmCtB) was carried out based on Expression Sequence Tags (ESTs) data, oligonucleotide microarray, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of BmCtB was observed in all of the tissues and stages. Among the 10 tested tissues, the fat body and posterior silk gland are the two most enriched tissues with BmCtB. During Bombyx development, there was an expression fastigium of BmCtB during metamorphosis. RNA interference was used to suppress the expression of cathepsin B during metamorphosis. Significant developmental defective phenotypes were obtained in the RNAi treated group. The dramatically reduced expression of BmCtB was confirmed by Northern blot and quantitative real-time PCR. These evidences strongly suggest cathepsin B protein-ase was predominantly involved in the metabolism process of fat body and the posterior silk gland and was critical for metamorphism and development of silkworm, Bombyx mori.</abstract>

    <abstract>We conducted three experiments for management of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) biotype 'B' on tomatoes under greenhouse conditions: (i) vertically placing yellow sticky cards either parallel or perpendicular to tomato rows at a rate of 1 per 3-m row; (ii) releasing Eretmocerus sp. nr. rajasthanicus once at 30 adults/m² in the high whitefly density greenhouses (> 10 adults/plant), or twice at 15 adults/m² at a 5-day interval in the low whitefly density greenhouses (< 10 adults/plant); and (iii) using combinations of yellow sticky cards that were placed vertically parallel to tomato rows and parasitoids released once at 30/m² in high whitefly density greenhouses or twice at 15/m² at a 5-day interval in low whitefly density greenhouses. Our data show that yellow sticky cards trapped B. tabaci adults and significantly reduced whitefly populations on tomato. The yellow sticky cards that were placed parallel to tomato rows caught significantly more whitefly adults than those placed perpendicular to tomato rows on every sampling date. In the treatment where parasitoids were released once at 30/m² in high whitefly density greenhouses, the number of live whitefly nymphs were reduced from 4.6/leaf to 2.9/leaf in 40 days as compared with those on untreated plants on which live whitefly nymphs increased from 4.4/leaf to 8.9/leaf. In the treatment where parasitoids were released twice at 15/m² in low whitefly density greenhouses, the numbers of live nymphs of B. tabaci on tomato leaves were reduced from 2.1/leaf to 1.7/leaf in 20 days as compared with those on untreated plants on which numbers of live nymphs of B. tabaci increased from 2.2/leaf to 4.5/leaf. In the treatment of yellow sticky cards and parasitoid release once at 30/m² in high whitefly density greenhouses, the numbers of live nymphs of B. tabaci on tomato leaves were reduced from 7.2/leaf to 1.9/leaf, and in the treatment of yellow sticky cards and parasitoid release twice at 15/m² at a 5-day interval at low whitefly density, the numbers of live nymphs of B. tabaci on tomato leaves were reduced from 2.5/leaf to 0.8/leaf; whereas the numbers of live nymphs of B. tabaci on untreated plants increased from 4.4/leaf to 8.9/leaf. An integrated program for management of B. tabaci on greenhouse vegetables by using yellow sticky cards, parasitoids and biorational insecticides is discussed.</abstract>

    <abstract>Sequences of 479 bp region of the mitochondrial COI gene were applied to detect population genetic diversity and structure of Dendroctonus valens populations. By comparing the genetic diversity between native and invasive populations, it was shown that the genetic diversity of Chinese populations was obviously lower than that of native populations with both indices of haplotype diversity and Nei's genetic diversity, suggesting genetic bottleneck occurred in the invasive process of D. valens, and was then followed by a relatively quick population buildup. According to phylogenetic analyses of haplotypes, we suggested that the origin of the Chinese population was from California, USA. Phylogenetic and network analysis of native populations of D. valens revealed strong genetic structure at two distinct spatial and temporal scales in North America. The main cause resulting in current biogeographic pattern was supposedly due to recycled glacial events. Meanwhile, a cryptic species might exist in the Mexican and Guatemalan populations.</abstract>

    <title>Cold tolerance and cold hardening strategy of the Japanese pine sawyer Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)</title>
    <abstract>The Japanese pine sawyer, Monochamus alternatus, is an important pine forest pest and vector transmitting the pine wilt nematode that causes pine wilt disease. Low temperatures in autumn, winter and spring often differentially affect mortality of M. alternatus larvae. In this paper, we mainly compared the differences of mortality and cold hardening of larvae from different seasons, based on supercooling point (SCP) and cumulative probability of individuals freezing (CPIF). The cold hardening of the larvae from autumn, winter and spring seasons were largely different. Correlations between mortality and CPIF of autumn and spring larvae were highest on day 1/4, and gradually decreased with prolonged exposure duration. This beetle's death mainly resulted from freezing in short exposure duration. However, the correlation between mortality and CPIF of winter larvae increased gradually with the prolonged exposure duration. Death did not mainly result from freezing in long exposure duration. Autumn larvae are more susceptible and adaptable than winter and spring larvae. Winter larvae have a slight freeze-tolerance trend. Our research showed that M. alternatus came into complex cold-hardening strategies under natural selection. Freeze avoidance is the primary strategy; with prolonged exposure duration to above SCP or < 0 °C, chill tolerance is more important; this is followed by freeze tolerance during harsh winters.</abstract>

    <title>Host preference of the bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus</title>
    <abstract>It is largely known that the range of an insect diet is mostly determined by oviposition behavior, mainly in species with endophytic larvae such as Zabrotes subfasciatus. However, the proximate factors determining host choice and the subsequent steps leading to the expansion or reduction of the host number and occasional host shifts are largely unknown. We analyzed various factors determining host preference of Z. subfasciatus through the evaluation of: (i) oviposition preference of a wild population of Z. subfasciatus on the usual host (bean) and unusual hosts (lentil, chickpea and soy), and the performance of the offspring; (ii) artificial selection for increasing preference for hosts initially less frequently chosen; (iii) comparison of oviposition behavior between two different populations (reared for ~30 generations in beans or chickpeas, respectively); (iv) oviposition timing on usual and unusual hosts; and (v) identification of preference hierarchies. We found that when using unusual hosts, there is no correlation between performance and preference and that the preference hierarchy changes only slightly when the population passes through several generations on the less frequently accepted host. We also found a positive response to artificial selection for increasing oviposition on the less preferred host; however, when the host-choice experiment involved two varieties of the usual host, the response was faster than when the choice involved usual and unusual hosts. Finally, beetles reared on an unusual host (chickpea) for 26 generations showed similar good fitness on both usual and unusual hosts, indicating that the use of a new host does not necessarily result in the loss of performance on the original host. Nevertheless, this population showed lower fitness on the usual host than that of the original population, suggesting an underlying partial trade-off phenomenon which may contribute to a broadening of diet of this insect species.</abstract>

Exposure to both Agri-50E and Oberon was followed by acceptable spore germination. Infectivity rates of L. muscarium on poinsettia foliage in the presence of dry residues of the insecticides were also investigated. No significant detrimental effects on the levels of control of B. tabaci were recorded compared with fungus applied to residue-free foliage. Sequential application of the chemicals Savona, Spray Oil and Majestik with the fungus all produced mortalities of second instar B. tabaci above 90%. Incorporation of these chemicals with L. muscarium into integrated control programs for B. tabaci is discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Divergence in the ovipositional behavior of the Papilio glaucus group</title>
    <abstract>This study contrasts the ovipositional profiles of four members of the Papilio glaucus group, P. glaucus, P. multicaudatus, P. canadensis, and P. rutulus. We used seven choice oviposition bioassays containing leaves from hosts in seven plant families utilized by members of the P. glaucus group. Specifically, we contrast the overall ovipositional profiles of these species and their acceptance of a host in a novel plant family (Populus tremuloides: Salicaceae) and a host in a putatively ancestral host plant family (Liriodendron tulipifera: Magnoliaceae). Significant differences were observed between the ovipositional profiles of P. glaucus and P. multicaudatus relative to each other and to P. canadensis and P. rutulus. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the ovipositional profiles of P. canadensis and P. rutulus, which were also the only species that accepted P. tremuloides. Unlike the acceptance of P. tremuloides, the acceptance of L. tulipifera was present throughout the group despite the inability of the larvae of most species in the group to utilize this host. These results support the prediction of the "hierarchical threshold model" that ancestral host plants are likely to be retained in the ovipositional hierarchy while novel hosts should only be accepted by derived populations.</abstract>

    <title>Choosing a Food Future: Differentiating Among Alternative Food Options</title>
    <abstract>This article examines the diversity of food networks that fit within the alternative food system of the United States. While farmers' markets, community supported agriculture schemes, and corporate organic food markets all fit within the alternative food system, they differ greatly in the conventions and beliefs that they represent. The alternative food system has divided into two movements: corporate, weak alternative food networks; and local, strong alternative food networks. The weak corporate version focuses on protecting the environment; however, it neglects issues concerning labor standards, animal welfare, rural communities, small-scale farmers, and human health. Local, strong alternative food networks not only assure environmental protection, but they also address the issues that weak alternatives neglect. Using three case studies from the Washington, D.C. metro area, the author explains that strong alternative food networks are better suited to create social and political change because they challenge the foundations of the conventional food system: standardized and generic products, price-based competition, consolidated power, and global scale. To affect true social and political change in the United States, the author recommends supporting strong alternative food networks by creating the requisite cultural and political space for them to succeed.</abstract>

Despite the fact that existing policy permits managing natural ignitions to meet resource benefits, or Wildland Fire Use (WFU), most fuel reduction projects rely on mechanical treatments and prescribed fire. Budget constraints suggest that successful fuel and ecosystem management hinges on expanding WFU. The decision to authorise WFU in the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) rests with line officers, and the so-called 'go/no go' decision constitutes a time-critical risk assessment. Factors influencing this decision clearly impact the viability of WFU. The present study examined influences on line officers' go/no go decision. A telephone survey was conducted of all USFS district rangers with WFU authority in the Northern, Intermountain, and Southwestern Regions. The census was completed during February 2005 and obtained an 85% response rate. Data were analysed using Classification and Regression Tree analysis. Personal commitment to WFU provided the primary classifier for 91% of the district rangers who authorised WFU. External factors, negative public perception, resource availability, and a perceived lack of support from the USFS were the main disincentives to authorising WFU.</abstract>

    <title>North Carolina Tobacco Farmers' Changing Perceptions of Tobacco Control and Tobacco Manufacturers</title>
    <abstract>Purpose: To examine tobacco farmers' attitudes toward tobacco control, public health, and tobacco manufacturers in order to determine the extent to which rapidly changing economic conditions have influenced North Carolina tobacco farmer attitudes in ways that may provide tobacco control advocates with new opportunities to promote tobacco control policies in tobacco-dependent US communities. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal sample of North Carolina tobacco farmers across 5 waves of data collection (1997-2005) (baseline N = 749 farmers). Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine changes in attitudes toward tobacco control and tobacco manufacturers, controlling for economic dependence on tobacco, and demographic factors. Results: Over the study period there was reduction in tobacco farmers' perceptions of threat from tobacco control initiatives. Conclusions: These changes in attitude may signal an opportunity for successful tobacco control activity in traditionally tobacco-dependent states and rural communities.</abstract>

    <title>Comparison of Program Costs for Parent-Only and Family-Based Interventions for Pediatric Obesity in Medically Underserved Rural Settings</title>
    <abstract>Purpose: To compare the costs of parent-only and family-based group interventions for childhood obesity delivered through Cooperative Extension Services in rural communities. Methods: Ninety-three overweight or obese children (aged 8 to 14 years) and their parent(s) participated in this randomized controlled trial, which included a 4-month intervention and 6-month follow-up. Families were randomized to either a behavioral family-based intervention (n = 33), a behavioral parent-only intervention (n = 34), or a waitlist control condition (n = 26). Only program costs data for the parent-only and family-based programs are reported here (n = 67). Assessments were completed at baseline, post-treatment (month 4) and follow-up (month 10). The primary outcome measures were total program costs and cost per child for the parent-only and family interventions. Findings: Twenty-six families in the parent-only intervention and 24 families in the family intervention completed all 3 assessments. As reported previously, both intervention programs led to significantly greater decreases in weight status relative to the control condition at month 10 follow-up. There was no significant difference in weight status change between the parent-only and family interventions. Total program costs for the parent-only and family interventions were $13,546 and $20,928, respectively. Total cost per child for the parent-only and family interventions were $521 and $872, respectively. Conclusions: Parent-only interventions may be a cost-effective alternative treatment for pediatric obesity, especially for families in medically underserved settings.</abstract>

    <title>Resistance levels and fitness of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PROTOX) inhibitor-resistant transgenic rice in paddy fields</title>
    <abstract>We previously confirmed that the transgenic rice line, M4, was about 200-fold more resistant to oxyfluorfen than the wild-type (WT) rice in whole-plant bioassays in pots. The transgenic rice line was also cross-resistant to other protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PROTOX)-inhibiting herbicides, acifluorfen, carfentrazone, and oxadiazon. The objectives of this research were to (a) verify the resistance of transgenic rice plants to commercial doses of PROTOX-inhibiting herbicides under paddy field conditions, (b) compare the growth, yield, and grain quality of transgenic and WT rice under weed-free conditions in a paddy field, and (c) determine the responses of transgenic and WT rice plants to chilling and drought stress. In the field, M4 was resistant to PROTOX inhibitors oxyfluorfen, acifluorfen, carfentrazone, pyraflufen, and oxadiazon in transplanted and direct-seeded rice culture. The transgenic and WT plants had similar plant heights and number of tillers. However, the yield of M4 at T₄ and T₅ generations was 7-8% less than that of WT plants. This was due to reduced number of spikelets per panicle and reduced grain weight. Head rice yield, immature kernels, damaged kernels, palatability, and protein and amylose contents were similar between M4 and WT rice. There was no difference in chilling injury between WT and M4, but M4 was more tolerant to drought stress than WT plants. PROTOX inhibitor-resistant rice is agronomically viable. It will expand the herbicide options in rice production. Follow-up research is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the slight yield difference and differential drought response between WT and transgenic rice.</abstract>

    <title>A staggered maize-legume intercrop arrangement robustly increases crop yields and economic returns in the highlands of Central Kenya</title>
    <abstract>Smallholder farmers in East-Africa commonly intercrop maize (Zea mays L.) with grain legumes to maximize utilisation of land and labour, and attain larger crop yields. Conventionally, one legume line is intercropped between each pair of maize lines. This study evaluated the potential of a modified two-by-two staggered arrangement (MBILI) to increase crop yields and economic benefits in two sites in Central Kenya with contrasting soil fertility levels during 7 consecutive seasons. Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) were grown as legume intercrops. The MBILI system resulted in increased maize yields in both sites, and increased cowpea yields in the poor site. In the fertile site, using beans as an intercrop was most profitable, and the MBILI system increased net benefits by 40%, relative to the conventional system. In the poor site, groundnut and cowpea were better adapted, and the MBILI system increased net benefit by 12-37%. Positive effects of the MBILI system were most pronounced in the poor site, but occurred independent of soil fertility level. Rainfall amounts and distribution varied widely, but the MBILI system increased yields both under conditions of ample and inadequate rainfall. N balances were negative with beans and groundnut, but neutral with cowpea as the intercrop. A modest N fertilizer application is therefore essential to sustain yields in the long term, especially when beans or groundnuts are intercropped. In conclusion, the MBILI system, when combined with adjusted nutrient inputs, resulted in superior and robust improvements in crop yields and economic benefits, relative to the conventional intercropping system.</abstract>

    <title>Growth, PAR use efficiency, and yield components of field-grown Vicia faba L. under different temperature and photoperiod regimes</title>
    <abstract>N-fixing legume crops may be a good component of a general plan to improve cropping system efficiency. For this purpose, crop suitability to specific environments must be established. To estimate the yield potential we examined the growth and yield response of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) crops to different thermal and photoperiod regimes. Irrigated field experiments were conducted in northwest Spain for 3 years (2004-2007) with cv. ‘Alameda' sown on five different dates in each year from mid-autumn to mid-spring. Environmental conditions experienced by plants across sowing dates were largely different. Sowing date had a great influence on biomass, grain yield and its components. This effect was associated with changes in PAR captured, PAR use efficiency (PUE) and biomass allocation to the different organs. Critical leaf area index (LAIcr) tended to increase and the extinction coefficient, k, to decrease as the sowing date was delayed. Earlier sowing dates intercepted more radiation over the whole season than the spring sowing dates. Greatest crop growth treatments (2nd and 3rd sowing dates) had the highest values of PAR use efficiency probably due to more adequate temperatures for photosynthesis and a large number of reproductive sinks. The highest grain yield (7733kgha⁻¹) was obtained with the mid-February sowing date, which produced the most pods and seeds per m², the largest harvest index (62.0%), and large maximum leaf area index (5.41). Low yields of mid-autumn (1st) and mid-spring (5th) sowing dates were associated with reduced pods and seeds per m². Temperature and photoperiod had a large impact on faba bean growth, development, and yield. Best yields were obtained when abundant assimilate supply and moderate temperatures were available during pod set.</abstract>

    <title>Indigenous legume fallows (indifallows) as an alternative soil fertility resource in smallholder maize cropping systems</title>
    <abstract>Widening the range of organic nutrient resources, especially N sources, is a major challenge for improving crop productivity of smallholder farms in southern Africa. A study was conducted over three seasons to evaluate different species of indigenous legumes for their biomass productivity, N₂-fixation and residual effects on subsequent maize crops on nutrient-depleted fields belonging to smallholder farmers under contrasting rainfall zones in Zimbabwe. Under high rainfall (>800mmyr⁻¹), 1-year indigenous legume fallows (indifallows), comprising mostly species of the genera Crotalaria, Indigofera and Tephrosia, yielded 8.6tha⁻¹ of biomass within 6 months, out-performing sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) green manure and grass (natural) fallows by 41% and 74%, respectively. A similar trend was observed under medium (650-750mmyr⁻¹) rainfall in Chinyika, where the indifallow attained a biomass yield of 6.6tha⁻¹ compared with 2.2tha⁻¹ for natural fallows. Cumulatively, over two growing seasons, the indifallow treatment under high rainfall at Domboshawa produced biomass as high as 28tha⁻¹ compared with ∼7tha⁻¹ under natural fallow. The mean total N₂ fixed under indifallows ranged from 125kgha⁻¹ under soils exhibiting severe nutrient depletion in Chikwaka, to 205kgha⁻¹ at Domboshawa. Indifallow biomass accumulated up to 210kgNha⁻¹, eleven-fold higher than the N contained in corresponding natural fallow biomass at time of incorporation. Application of P to indifallows significantly increased both biomass productivity and N₂-fixation, translating into positive yield responses by subsequent maize. Differences in maize biomass productivity between indifallow and natural fallow treatments were already apparent at 2 weeks after maize emergence, with the former yielding significantly (P <0.05) more maize biomass than the latter. The first maize crop following termination of 1-year indifallows yielded grain averaging 2.3tha⁻¹, significantly out-yielding 1-year natural fallows by >1tha⁻¹. In the second season, maize yields were consistently better under indifallows compared with natural fallows in terms of both grain and total biomass. The first maize crop following 2-year indifallows yielded ∼3tha⁻¹ of grain, significantly higher than the second maize crop after 1-year indifallows and natural fallows. The study demonstrated that indigenous legumes can generate N-rich biomass in sufficient quantities to make a significant influence on maize productivity for more than a single season. Maize yield gains under indifallow systems on low fertility sandy soils exceeded the yields attained with either mineral fertilizer alone or traditional green manure crop of sunnhemp.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of lowering the root/shoot ratio by pruning roots on water use efficiency and grain yield of winter wheat</title>
    <abstract>A pot and a field experiment were conducted to assess the effects of root/shoot ratio (R/S) on the water use efficiency (WUE) and grain yield of winter wheat. The R/S was regulated by pruning the roots during the stem elongation stage, resulting in reduced root systems of the plants. At the heading stage, the root dry weight of root-pruned plants was less than that of intact-root plants, but their R/S was similar to that of intact-root plants under both experimental conditions. After tiller pruning, the R/S of root-pruned plants was significantly lower than that of intact-root plants (p <0.05). Root pruning reduced the rate of leaf transpiration and lowered the number of tillers per plant (p <0.05) during the vegetative stage. As a result, root-pruned wheat showed reduced water use when compared to intact-root plants before heading (p <0.05). At anthesis, there was no significant difference in transpiration between plants with intact roots and those with pruned roots in the pots. However, under field conditions, transpiration of root-pruned plants was significantly higher than that of intact-root plants at anthesis. Additionally, at anthesis root-pruned plants had a higher rate of leaf photosynthesis and lower rate of root respiration, which resulted in a significantly higher grain yield at maturity when compared to plants with intact roots. Under both experimental conditions, there were no significant differences in shoot dry weight per plant between root-pruned and intact-root plants grown in monoculture. When root-pruned plants were grown with intact-root plants, the root-pruned wheat was less productive and had a lower relative shoot dry weight (0.78 and 0.86, respectively) than the intact-root plants (1.24 and 1.16, respectively). These results suggest that plants with pruned roots had a lower ability to compete and to acquire and use the same resources in the mixture when compared with intact-root plants. Root pruning improved the WUE of winter wheat under both experimental conditions. This suggests that appropriate management for the root system/tillers in wheat crops can be used to increase grain yield and water use efficiency. Specifically, lowering the R/S improved the grain yield and WUE of winter wheat significantly by lowering its competitive ability and improving root efficiency. Therefore, drought-resistance breeding to improve the grain yield and WUE, at least for wheat, should be made by targeted selection of less competitive progeny with a small R/S for cultivation in arid and semiarid areas.</abstract>

    <title>Canopy temperature on clear and cloudy days can be used to estimate varietal differences in stomatal conductance in rice</title>
    <abstract>Leaf photosynthetic potential, a major determinant of yield potential in rice, is mostly explained by stomatal conductance (g s) as well as leaf N content (Rubisco protein content). Therefore, the rapid and precise evaluation of g s as well as leaf N content would be a valuable addition to rice breeding programs aimed at improved yield potential. We established a simple method based on infrared thermography to estimate varietal differences in g s. Seven rice varieties were cultivated in two-row plots in 2007, and canopy temperatures in three varieties, including a control variety, Koshihikari, were simultaneously measured to determine canopy temperature difference (CTd) between Koshihikari and the other varieties on clear days. The varieties Takanari, Habataki, and TUAT1-5-6a displayed significantly (P <0.05) lower leaf temperature and higher g s and leaf photosynthetic rate (P n) than Koshihikari. CTd was closely correlated with g s and P n. These results indicate that CTd may be useful as a relative index to estimate varietal differences in g s. A significant CTd was still observed even under cloudy conditions in 2008. Takanari and TUAT1-5-6a had lower leaf temperature than Koshihikari on cloudy days as well as on clear days. Subsequent investigation of photosynthetic light response curves revealed that Takanari and TUAT1-5-6a had higher g s and P n than Koshihikari under lower irradiance. These results suggest that infrared thermography may be a simple method of evaluating varietal differences in g s through CTd, and that it may be practicable even under cloudy conditions.</abstract>

    <title>Analysis of starch swelling power in Australian breeding lines of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)</title>
    <abstract>Starch is the major component of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain and is composed of two large glucan molecules, amylose and amylopectin. The ratio between the two polymers types influences the water absorbing properties of starch upon heating, and thus affects the end-use of grain and purified starch. In this study, we evaluated the starch swelling power (SSP) values in seven wheat populations developed from crosses involving low-SSP lines. Analysis of starch produced by the F₂ generation plants showed that the largest SSP variation (11.4-16.2) and lowest SSP mean (13.9) was obtained for a population derived from doubled haploid lines SM1028 (SSP=14.5) and VK306 (SSP=13.6). The population of 360 lines was advanced by single seed descent to the following generations for further studies. Starch analysis of grain produced by F₄ generation lines in two field locations during 2006 and in a greenhouse environment during 2005 showed that SSP values were relatively stably inherited. The average broad-sense heritability was 73% and significant (P <0.001) genotype×genotype and genotype×environment interactions were seen. Starches with the highest and lowest SSP values were inversely related to amylose concentration determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of debranched starch. Developed lines with the lowest SSP values surpassed 40% in apparent amylose concentration. The study illustrates that screening for SSP in early generations can be used to develop wheat lines with desired starch swelling characteristics.</abstract>

    <title>Comparing the interactive effects of water and nitrogen on durum wheat and barley grown in a Mediterranean environment</title>
    <abstract>The understanding of the interactive effect of water and N availability, associated with the ability of crops to efficiently use these resources, is a crucial issue for stabilizing cereal production in Mediterranean areas. A 3-year side by side experiment on durum wheat and barley, under different water regimes and nitrogen levels, was carried out in a typical Mediterranean environment of Southern Italy, to identify the outstanding features of these species that contribute to enhanced grain yield and improved water and nitrogen use efficiency. Wheat and barley response was assessed under three water supply regimes (I ₁₀₀, I ₅₀, I ₀: full irrigation, 50% of full irrigation and rainfed) coupled with two N fertilizer levels (high N: 120kgha⁻¹ and low N: not fertilized). In order to evaluate barley yield response under lower N rates, 60kgha⁻¹ were applied in 2006. The occurrence of abundant rainfall during the experimental period determined only mild water stress during most of the growing season, especially in 2006 and 2007. Under these conditions, nitrogen fertilization was the main factor affecting crop response, and different crop traits in response to irrigation were primarily evident on tissue N concentrations. Grain number per unit land area explained a high proportion of grain yield and it was mainly influenced by N fertilization. Water availability enhanced N absorption: the response of both crops to N fertilization, in terms of N uptaken and grain N concentration, was higher in the year characterized by greater water availability during the most sensitive stages to drought stress. Under unfertilized conditions, the two crops showed similar response in terms of number of grains per unit land area; under N fertilization, barley exhibited a higher increase in number of grains per unit land area, but wheat achieved similar yields as consequence of the higher grain weight. In years characterized by similar average productivity of wheat, barley did not show further increase in number of seeds, even doubling the rate of N supplied. By increasing irrigation water supply, the two crops showed a similar yield response, but a different N partition, as confirmed by the lower nitrogen harvest index values for barley over 2007-2008. At similar total availability of N, barley reached higher N utilization efficiency than wheat, mainly because of a lower N concentration in the grain rather than a higher efficiency in using the available N.</abstract>

    <title>Sustainability of winter wheat production on sandy-loamy Cambisol in the Czech Republic: Results from a long-term fertilizer and crop rotation experiment</title>
    <abstract>Although Cambisols are the predominant soil type in Central Europe, especially in less favoured mountain areas, the long-term sustainability of winter wheat production on such soils has not been examined. In this paper, the yield of winter wheat over 50 years of farmyard manure, N, P and K fertilizer application (12 treatments altogether) was analysed in the Lukavec Crop Rotation Experiment (LCRE), which was established in 1955 in a potato-growing area (mean annual precipitation and temperature 686mm and 6.8°C, respectively). In the unfertilized control, low plant available P, K and Mg concentrations were recorded after 50 years. The annual yield growth (AYG) of grain was negative in the control as well as in low N treatments and positive in the 46kgNha⁻¹ treatment. The mean AYG ranged from 7.1 to 72.8kgha⁻¹ following the application of 46 to 121kgNha⁻¹, respectively. In the first decade of the experiment, the increase in grain yield per 1kg of applied N was 7.3kgha⁻¹ while in the last decade it was 27.1kgha⁻¹. The mean grain yield of long-straw and short-straw varieties was 3.9 and 4.7tha⁻¹, respectively. In the control, the grain yields were 4.3, 3.2 and 2.4tha⁻¹ after root crops, legumes and cereals, respectively. To summarize the 50 years' results of winter wheat production in the LCRE, grain yield was the most affected by mineral fertilizers, followed by the effect of variety, the preceding crop and farmyard manure application. The long-term sustainability of winter wheat production on low productive sandy-loamy Cambisols can be achieved only by adequate application of N, P and K fertilizers. High year-to-year variation in grain yield stresses the necessity of long-term studies in crop research, which are able to separate real trends from inter-annual fluctuations.</abstract>

    <title>Flame interactions and burning characteristics of two live leaf samples</title>
    <abstract>Combustion experiments were performed over a flat-flame burner that provided the heat source for multiple leaf samples. Interactions of the combustion behavior between two leaf samples were studied. Two leaves were placed in the path of the flat-flame burner, with the top leaf 2.5 cm above the bottom leaf. Local gas and particle temperatures, as well as local oxygen concentrations, were measured along with burning characteristics of both leaves. Results showed that the time to ignition of the upper leaf was not significantly affected by the presence of the lower leaf. The major difference observed was that the time of flame duration of the upper leaf was significantly affected by the presence of the lower leaf. Causes for the prolonged flame were found to be the consumption of oxygen by the burning lower leaf and the obstruction provided by the lower leaf, causing a wake effect, thus altering the combustion behavior of the upper leaf.</abstract>

    <title>Fire severity in a northern Australian savanna landscape: the importance of time since previous fire</title>
    <abstract>Using a detailed fire history collected over a 10-year period throughout a savanna landscape in northern Australia, we have addressed the question of whether fire severity, inferred from a semiquantitative fire severity index, increases with time since previous fire. There was a clear trend of fires becoming much more severe with increasing time since previous fire. Between 1 and 5 years following a fire, the probability of a subsequent fire being classified as 'severe' increased from 3 to 8% for early dry-season fires, and from 21 to 43% for late dry-season fires. It was clear that the strong increase in fire severity was not confined to the first 2-3 years following the previous fire, as previously suspected. These findings highlight the difficulty of reducing both fire frequency and severity in northern Australian savanna landscapes, as they imply that a negative feedback process exists between the two; that is, reducing fire frequency is likely to increase the severity of fires that do occur.</abstract>

    <title>Strength of Tobacco Control in Rural Communities</title>
    <abstract>Purpose: This study aimed to: (a) describe the Strength of Tobacco Control (SoTC) capacity, efforts and resources in rural communities, and (b) examine the relationships between SoTC scores and sociodemographic, political, and health-ranking variables. Methods: Data were collected during the baseline preintervention phase of a community-based randomized, controlled trial. Rural counties were selected using stratified random sampling (n = 39). Key informant interviews were employed. The SoTC, originally developed and tested with states, was adapted to a county-level measure assessing capacity, efforts, and resources. Univariate analysis and bivariate correlations assessed the SoTC total score and construct scores, as well as their relationships. Multiple regression examined the relationships of county-level sociodemographic, political, and health-ranking variables with SoTC total and construct scores. Findings: County population size was positively correlated with capacity (r = 0.44; P < .01), efforts (r = 0.54; P= .01), and SoTC total score (r = 0.51; P < .01). Communities with more resources for tobacco control had better overall county health rankings (r = .43; P < .01). With population size, percent Caucasian, tobacco production, and smoking prevalence as potential predictors of SoTC total score, only population size was significant. Conclusions: SoTC scores may be useful in determining local tobacco control efforts and appropriate planning for additional public health interventions and resources. Larger rural communities were more likely to have strong tobacco control programs than smaller communities. Smaller rural communities may need to be targeted for training and technical assistance. Leadership development and allocation of resources are needed in all rural communities to address disparities in tobacco use and tobacco control policies.</abstract>

    <title>Microclimate patterns on the leeside of single-row tree windbreaks during different weather conditions in Florida farms: implications for improved crop production</title>
    <abstract>Florida citrus and vegetable crops generate billions of dollars in revenue every year. However, wind, freezing temperatures, hurricanes, and diseases negatively impact production. Windbreaks located perpendicular to the prevailing wind can increase farm production simply by reducing wind and modifying microclimate. Windbreaks can also help in managing pathogens such as citrus canker (Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri). To study the modification of wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity on the leeside of single-row tree windbreaks in southern Florida, automated weather stations were installed in 2007/2008 at 2 m above the ground along transects perpendicular to a eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) and three cadaghi (Corymbia torelliana) (WB1-WB3) windbreaks. All windbreaks reduced wind speed, with minimum wind speed (~5% of the open wind speed) at two times the distance of windbreak height (2H, where H = windbreak height in m) on the leeside of a E. redcedar (~17% porosity) and at 4H (~3-30% of the open wind speed) and 6H (<50% of the open wind speed) on the leeside of cadaghi windbreaks WB1 (~22% porosity) and WB2 (~36% porosity), respectively, when the wind direction was nearly perpendicular to the windbreaks. Wind speed reduction was observed up to 31 times the windbreak height (31H). Cadaghi windbreaks reduced wind speed on the leeside even during a tropical storm event. Temperatures on the leeside of the windbreaks were warmer during the day and cooler near the windbreaks at night compared to temperature in the open fields. This study demonstrates that single-row tree windbreaks can reduce wind and modify the microclimate to enhance crop production for Florida growers.</abstract>

    <title>The association between bulk tank milk analysis for raw milk quality and on-farm management practices</title>
    <abstract>Our objective was to determine the risk factors associated with bacteriological quality of bulk tank milk. Bulk tank milk samples were collected from all Prince Edward Island dairy herds (n =235) from March 2005 to March 2007. Biweekly total bacterial, preliminary incubation, laboratory pasteurization, and coliform counts were conducted using a Petrifilm culture system. Data for on-farm risk factors were collected via a mail-out survey which consisted of 4 main sections: (1) general farm demographics and management, (2) cow cleanliness and hygiene, (3) milking procedures and mastitis control, and (4) equipment maintenance and cleaning. Of 235 producers, 153 completed the mail-out survey giving a response rate of 65%. Both total aerobic and preliminary incubation counts were positively associated with the amount of soiling on the teats prior to udder preparation, manual cleaning of the bulk tank, and the use of a specific type of detergent. Additionally, various methods of premilking udder preparation were important, with pre-dip followed by drying being superior to other methods in reducing the bacterial counts. The laboratory pasteurization count was positively associated with the presence of a plate cooler and inadequate frequency of acid wash, whereas having a water purification system was negatively associated with laboratory pasteurization count. Finally, coliform count was negatively associated with clipping udder hair and automated washing of the bulk tank, whereas increasing herd size and inadequate frequency of acid wash were risk factors. Season was a significant predictor for all bacterial counts with the lowest counts tending to occur in winter.</abstract>

    <title>Antimicrobial use in Swiss dairy farms: Quantification and evaluation of data quality</title>
    <abstract>Data on antimicrobial use play a key role in the development of policies for the containment of antimicrobial resistance. On-farm data could provide a detailed overview of the antimicrobial use, but technical and methodological aspects of data collection and interpretation, as well as data quality need to be further assessed. The aims of this study were (1) to quantify antimicrobial use in the study population using different units of measurement and contrast the results obtained, (2) to evaluate data quality of farm records on antimicrobial use, and (3) to compare data quality of different recording systems. During 1 year, data on antimicrobial use were collected from 97 dairy farms. Antimicrobial consumption was quantified using: (1) the incidence density of antimicrobial treatments; (2) the weight of active substance; (3) the used daily dose and (4) the used course dose for antimicrobials for intestinal, intrauterine and systemic use; and (5) the used unit dose, for antimicrobials for intramammary use. Data quality was evaluated by describing completeness and accuracy of the recorded information, and by comparing farmers' and veterinarians' records. Relative consumption of antimicrobials depended on the unit of measurement: used doses reflected the treatment intensity better than weight of active substance. The use of antimicrobials classified as high priority was low, although under- and overdosing were frequently observed. Electronic recording systems allowed better traceability of the animals treated. Recording drug name or dosage often resulted in incomplete or inaccurate information. Veterinarians tended to record more drugs than farmers. The integration of veterinarian and farm data would improve data quality.</abstract>

    <title>Integrating agroecology and landscape multifunctionality in Vermont: An evolving framework to evaluate the design of agroecosystems</title>
    <abstract>Agroecosystems cover vast areas of land worldwide and are known to have a large impact on the environment, yet these highly modified landscapes are rarely considered as candidates for landscape design. While intentionally-designed agricultural landscapes could serve many different functions, few resources exist for evaluating the design of these complex landscapes, particularly at the scale of the whole-farm. The objective of this paper is to introduce an evolving framework for evaluating the design of agroecosystems based on a critical review of the literature on landscape multifunctionality and agroecology. We consider how agroecosystems might be designed to incorporate additional functions while adhering to agroecology principles for managing the landscape. The framework includes an assessment tool for evaluating farm design based on the extent of fine-scale land use features and their specific functions, to consider the present state of the farm, to plan for future conditions, or to compare alternative futures for the design of the farm. We apply this framework to two farms in Vermont that are recognized locally as successful, multifunctional landscapes. The Intervale Center, an agricultural landscape located within the city limits, serves as an incubator for new farm startups and provides unique cultural functions that benefit the local community. Butterworks Farm, a private operation producing organic yogurt and other food products, achieves important ecological functions through an integrated crop-livestock system. These farms and many others in Vermont serve as models of a framework that integrates landscape multifunctionality and agroecology in the design of the landscape. In the discussion section, we draw from the literature and our work to propose a set of important themes that might be considered for future research.</abstract>

    <title>Biochemical profiles, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) for typing Staphylococcus aureus isolated from dairy products</title>
    <abstract>The study concerns 130 Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from different raw-milk dairy products (122 isolates) and human samples (eight isolates). Four different typing techniques were applied: biochemical profiles (Biolog GP), restriction fragment length polymorphism of coagulase gene (coaRFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Moreover multiplex-PCR was used to study the distribution of genes encoding staphylococcal enterotoxins. The results of this study reveal marked genomic and phenotypic variability among the tested S. aureus. The considered techniques were all found useful for strain typing, but, based on discriminatory power as the key parameter of the typing system, MLVA and Biolog GP were found to be the most powerful techniques. The methods showed little concordance in terms of discerning the clusters of related strains.</abstract>

    <title>Assessing the efficiency of a pharmacokinetic-based algorithm for target-controlled infusion of ketamine in ponies</title>
    <abstract>The objective of this study was to assess a pharmacokinetic algorithm to predict ketamine plasma concentration and drive a target-controlled infusion (TCI) in ponies. Firstly, the algorithm was used to simulate the course of ketamine enantiomers plasma concentrations after the administration of an intravenous bolus in six ponies based on individual pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from a previous experiment. Using the same pharmacokinetic parameters, a TCI of S-ketamine was then performed over 120 min to maintain a concentration of 1 μg/mL in plasma. The actual plasma concentrations of S-ketamine were measured from arterial samples using capillary electrophoresis. The performance of the simulation for the administration of a single bolus was very good. During the TCI, the S-ketamine plasma concentrations were maintained within the limit of acceptance (wobble and divergence <20%) at a median of 79% (IQR, 71–90) of the peak concentration reached after the initial bolus. However, in three ponies the steady concentrations were significantly higher than targeted. It is hypothesized that an inaccurate estimation of the volume of the central compartment is partly responsible for that difference. The algorithm allowed good predictions for the single bolus administration and an appropriate maintenance of constant plasma concentrations.</abstract>

    <title>Bio-discrimination of α-tocopherol Stereoisomers in Rearing and Veal Calves Fed Milk Replacer Supplemented with All-rac-α-tocopheryl Acetate.</title>
    <abstract>This study evaluated the biological discrimination of different α-tocopherol stereoisomers (i. e. RRR-, RRS-, RSR-, RSS- and the four 2S-α-tocopherols) from all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate supplementation in milk replacer for rearing and veal calves respectively, in practical farming conditions. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, six rearing calves were fed milk replacer supplemented with 80 mg/kg all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate for a period of 9 weeks. The calves were supplied calf starter concentrate from 1 to 12 weeks. In experiment 2, six veal calves were fed milk replacer supplemented with 80 mg/kg all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate for a period of 24 weeks. Blood samples were taken at the start and every 4 weeks until 12 weeks for rearing calves in experiment 1, and until slaughter (24 weeks) for veal calves in experiment 2. Liver, adipose, muscle, and brain samples were taken at slaughter of the six veal calves in experiment 2. The distribution of different α-tocopherol stereoisomers in feed, plasma, and tissues was analyzed. In both experiments, it was observed that RRR-α-tocopherol was the dominant stereoisomer in plasma and tissues. The average percentage of the RRR-α-tocopherol stereoisomer was 64 %, and 39 % of the total α-tocopherol in plasma for rearing and veal calves, respectively. The higher RRR-α-tocopherol stereoisomer proportion as percentage of the total α-tocopherol in rearing calves was related to higher dietary natural vitamin E intake. Other 2R-α-tocopherol stereoisomers had lower utilization efficiency than RRR-α-tocopherol stereoisomer. 2S-α-tocopherol stereoisomers were basically not utilized by calves.</abstract>

    <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Weight-loss Program for Perimenopausal Women.</title>
    <abstract>In this study, we set out to perform a comparative evaluation of variations in body weight and volume between two groups of women, one young adult and the other perimenopausal, each of which followed a specific weight loss program for the same period of time. The evaluation was based on the weight and volume data obtained from a clinical and anthropometric study. From the anthropometric values obtained, we conclude that in both groups of women, the diet followed was found to be effective in reducing weight and volume, but with respect to time, the weight loss was more noticeable among the younger women, while among the menopausal women it took place more slowly. The difference between the two groups might be explained by diverse hormonal effects, such that metabolism (and therefore caloric expenditure) is higher among the younger women.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of Vitamin E Supplementation on Oxidative Stress in a Rat Model of Diet-induced Obesity.</title>
    <abstract>Objective: To evaluate the effect of vitamin E on the level of oxidative stress in diet-induced obese Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods: Thirty weaning male rats were placed into three groups with 10 animals each: a control group with normal chow, a diet-induced obesity group (DIO) with high-fat diet, and an intervention group with high-fat diet supplemented with vitamin E (VE, 350 mg/kg). Blood and adipose tissue were collected from rats after 10 weeks. Biomarkers of oxidative stress were detected for plasma 8-epi-prostaglandin- F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), total anti-oxidative capacity (TAOC), α-tocopherol, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx). Lipid and glucose metabolism parameters such as plasma glucose, insulin, and triacylglycerol (TG) were also analyzed. Results: After 10 weeks, all obese rats (both the DIO and VE groups) had higher plasma 8-epi-PGF2α and TBARS levels than the controls. Their plasma-adjusted α-tocopherol, SOD, and GPx activities were lower than the control levels but insulin was higher (p<0.01). The VE intervention increased plasma SOD, GPx, and T-AOC, and decreased 8-epi-PGF2α (p<0.05). VE intervention also decreased plasma glucose, insulin, and TG levels (p<0.05). Conclusions: Increased oxidative stress could be an important target for the prevention of obesity-related diseases. Vitamin E has moderate effects for improvement of oxidative stress status and glucose metabolism in the animal model of diet-induced obesity.</abstract>

    <title>The anatomical characteristics of the aggregated lymphoid nodule area in the stomach of Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) of different ages</title>
    <abstract>The aggregated lymphoid nodule area (ALNA) in the third compartment of the stomach of Chinese Alashan Bactrian camels is a recently described species-specific anatomical structure. To further establish the relationship between this structure and animal age, 40 Bactrian camels of the following four age groups were studied: young (0.5–2 years); pubertal (3–5 years); middle-aged (6–16 years), and old (17–20 years). The ALNA in the third stomach compartment was measured and weighed for each group as was the height and number of mucosal folds. The exact anatomical location and the mucosal characteristics of the ALNA were also recorded. The results indicated that the ALNA not only has a particular anatomical location and distinct mucosal structure, but also changes with age. The structure was found along the ventral wall of the isthmus, from the origin of the proximal enlargement and along the curvatura ventriculi minor, forming a triangular band-like region. The mucosal folds containing the ALNA were much thicker than adjacent folds that did not contain this structure. Statistical analysis indicated that the ALNA enlarges prior to puberty, peaks in size at puberty, and then regresses. A small, vestigial ALNA was found in 20-years-old camels, although the germinal centres of the lymphoid nodules were not as obvious at this time. The data indicated that changes in ALNA structure occurs with development and ageing.</abstract>

    <title>Age-related differences in prostaglandin E₂ synthesis by equine cartilage explants and synoviocytes</title>
    <abstract>Briston, L., Dudhia, J., Lees, P. Age-related differences in prostaglandin E₂ synthesis by equine cartilage explants and synoviocytes. J. vet. Pharmacol. Therap.33, 268-276. Time- and concentration-related actions of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the synthesis of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) were investigated in cartilage explants and synoviocytes harvested from 3 age groups of horses, all with clinically normal joint function: group A <10 years; group B 11-20 years and group C >20 years. Cartilage explants from group A horses were least and those from group C were most sensitive to LPS. Significant increases in PGE₂ concentration (P [less-than or equal to] 0.01) were obtained in group C horses in response to LPS concentrations of 1.0 μg/mL (and higher) after exposure for 24, 36 and 48 h, whereas explants from group A horses failed to respond to LPS at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL after exposure times up to 48 h. In contrast, synoviocytes from group A horses were most and those from group C horses were least sensitive to LPS stimulation. Synoviocytes from group A horses responded to LPS concentrations of 1 μg/mL (and higher) with significantly increased concentrations of PGE₂ at 24 and 36 h. Significant but numerically smaller increases in PGE₂ concentration were induced by LPS in synoviocytes from groups B and C. As the effects of high PGE₂ concentrations are catabolic for cartilage, these observations suggest that both synoviocytes and chondrocytes might exert roles in the degenerative changes which occur in cartilage in horses with osteoarthritis.</abstract>

    <title>Strategies for improving phosphorus acquisition efficiency of crop plants</title>
    <abstract>In many low input agricultural systems, phosphorus (P) is one of the most limiting mineral nutrients for plant production. Although applying P fertilizer, if available, is the most performing practice, this should be accompanied by other measures. The use of genetically enhanced plants with improved P acquisition efficiency may represent a sustainable solution to increase crop yields in these systems. This review is intended to provide a summary on adaptation mechanisms of crop plants facing P deficiency as the starting point to develop a research approach for improving P acquisition efficiency. P acquisition efficiency in this review refers to external P efficiency. The suggested research approach includes three strategies: molecular assisted plant breeding, deployment of transgenic plants and the use of agricultural practices. The natural source for improving P nutrition of plants is the existing large genetic variation for plant traits that are associated with P acquisition efficiency and will therefore be emphasized in this review.</abstract>

    <title>Implications of narrow crop row spacing and delayed Echinochloa colona and Echinochloa crus-galli emergence for weed growth and crop yield loss in aerobic rice</title>
    <abstract>Field experiments were conducted in 2008 and 2009 to determine growth and seed production of Echinochloa colona and Echinochloa crus-galli emerging at five intervals (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days after rice emergence, DARE) in aerobic rice seeded at 20- and 30-cm row spacing. Plant height of these two weed species was not influenced by the crop row, but it was influenced by the weed emergence time. Weeds of either species emerging until 30 DARE had greater biomass and more seeds under wide rows than under narrow rows, but row spacing had no effect on biomass and seeds of plants emerging later. In both crop row spacing treatments, delay in weed emergence until 45 DARE significantly reduced weed biomass. E. colona and E. crus-galli plants that emerged 60 DARE produced only 3 seeds plant⁻¹ in 30-cm rows, whereas no seed was produced by these plants in 20-cm rows. Fitting a single linear function to the combined data for rows and weed emergence time gave a strong positive linear relationship between shoot biomass (g plant⁻¹) and seed production (number plant⁻¹) of these species, accounting for 94% and 93% variation in E. colona and E. crus-galli, respectively. These relationships can be used as a predictor of seed production in these species. Regardless of the weed species and weed emergence date, rice grain yields were greater in narrow rows than in wider rows. In the case of both weed species, rice grain yield improved significantly with each delay in weed emergence up to 45 DARE. The results of this study suggest that narrowing row spacing and controlling early weeds led to decreased weed growth and seed production, and increased grain yield in aerobic rice. Narrow crop row spacing and early weed control could be important components of integrated weed management strategies in aerobic rice.</abstract>

    <title>Calibration and performance evaluation of soybean and spring wheat cultivars using the STICS crop model in Eastern Canada</title>
    <abstract>Crop modelling at a regional scale is often limited by the availability of input data. Soil databases can be an efficient way to provide spatial information regarding soil properties, and remote sensing has proved to be a valuable source of information of management practices through assimilation of variable, like leaf area index (LAI), in crop model. However, the large numbers of cultivars from seed companies used at the regional scale remain an important concern for regional crop modelling. The aim of this study is to test whether we can limit calibration to only one cultivar per crop for modelling LAI, biomass and yield dynamics in the Mixedwood Plains ecozone, which extends over 3° of latitude and 10° of longitude in Eastern Canada. The ability to use the new regionally adapted soybean cultivar (CanSoyEst) and spring wheat cultivar (CanBleEst) to predict LAI, biomass, and yield in the studied area was evaluated using data from several sites distributed between Southwestern Quebec and Southern Ontario. The model used is STICS, a generic open code crop model, which offers easy access to cultivar parameters and the ability to assimilate LAI from remote sensing to derive input data for regional scale studies. The CanBleEst cultivar provided good estimates of biomass and yield, with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging between 10% and 20%. More scatter was observed for LAI estimates with a RMSE ranging from 21% to 25% depending on the sites. For the CanSoyEst cultivar, the predicted biomass had a RMSE ranging from 23% to 27% and the RMSE was about 26% for yield predictions whereas the predicted LAI showed more scatter (28%≤RMSE≤38%). A higher exposure to water stress and leaf shedding during senescence may explain why soybean output variables were predicted with more scatter. This work demonstrates that one cultivar per crop (i.e., soybean and spring wheat) provides enough accuracy to predict LAI, biomass and yield over the entire region. It provides a new soybean cultivar parameterization adapted to a short growing season and the first calibration and evaluation of a spring wheat cultivar in the STICS crop model. These contributions open new opportunities for using STICS in Northern climates characterized by short growing seasons. It also offers a foundation for crop modelling and prediction at regional scale in Eastern Canada.</abstract>

    <title>Breeding resilient and productive genotypes adapted to drought-prone rainfed ecosystem of India</title>
    <abstract>Drought is the predominant cause of yield reduction in rainfed rice production systems, but until recently, little systematic effort has been made to breed drought-tolerant cultivars. The complex nature of drought tolerance, genotype×environment interaction, and the difficulty of effective drought tolerance screening complicate the development of drought tolerant varieties. This study reports on progress made by a collaborative network of Indian rice breeding programs, in partnership with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), to develop lines combining high yield potential with drought tolerance by employing direct selection for grain yield under drought stress, and testing their performance in rainy season managed-drought screenings (RSMDS) of different stress severity levels at several locations during the main season in rainfed rice production areas in India. Advanced-generation breeding lines of less than 100 days, 100-120 days, and greater than 120 days duration generated at eight national institutes and IRRI using diverse drought tolerant donors were evaluated in 2005-2007 under RSMDS. Stress was imposed at the reproductive stage, either by draining paddies shortly after transplanting for lowland trials, or by stopping irrigation before flowering for upland trials. Yield reduction of 34-53% under moderate stress and 65-88% under severe stress was achieved in comparison to irrigated controls. Several varieties that have been widely grown in rainfed environments in India for many years, including IR 36, IR 64, Mahamaya, Sambha Mahsuri, and Swarna, were shown to be highly susceptible. Breeding lines were identified that perform consistently better than these and other widely grown rainfed varieties under both moderate and severe drought stress without any yield penalty under fully irrigated conditions. In the combined analysis over locations and years, these promising breeding lines outyielded the widely grown controls by about 0.5tha⁻¹ under moderate stress and 0.7-1.0tha⁻¹ under severe stress. IRRI breeding lines contributed to the network were developed using a selection protocol involving replicated dry season managed-drought screening (DSMDS) in dry season at Los Banos, Philippines. For a subset of lines extensively tested both at IRRI and in India, correlations between yield under DSMDS in the Philippine and yield in RSMDS in India were moderately high, indicating the efficacy of dry-season MS screening at IRRI in identifying tolerant lines for India. Drought tolerant lines developed by the network members have been released in several Indian states and in the Philippines. Overall, these results indicate that managed stress screening for drought tolerance, with a focus on selection for yield under stress, is effective in generating drought-tolerant cultivars.</abstract>

    <title>Multiple stress response and belowground competition in multilines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)</title>
    <abstract>Multilines (genetic mixtures) composed of genotypes of contrasting root architecture were hypothesized to show improved growth and productivity in comparison with genetic monocultures in conditions of multiple edaphic stresses. To test this hypothesis, three multilines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), each composed of two recombinant inbred lines having contrasting root architecture in previous studies, were evaluated at seven sites in Honduras with varying soil phosphorus and moisture availability. Molecular markers were used to quantify the presence of each genotype in both root and seed-yield samples. Root growth in competition was dependent on both soil treatment and genotype. In one of the multilines, the root zone was dominated by one genotype, especially in the high-P treatment. In contrast, the root zone of another multiline had equal representation from both genotypes. These results show that response to belowground competition can differ among genotypes of the same species. No tradeoff between root growth and plant performance (yield or shoot biomass) was observed. Contrary to expected results, profiles of root distribution did not differ significantly in the environments tested in this study. As a result, differences in uptake of resources (phosphorus and water) in divergent soil domains and yield advantage of multilines were observed in only a small number of cases. Multilines did not create any yield penalty. Future work with genotypes that are more contrasting in root architecture is necessary to assess this strategy for use by resource-poor farmers.</abstract>

    <title>Row spacing, tillage system, and herbicide technology affects cotton plant growth and yield</title>
    <abstract>Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) producers are faced with numerous production choices including cotton varieties, herbicide technology, tillage systems, and row spacing. A study was conducted to compare cotton production across conventional, glyphosate-tolerant, and glufosinate-tolerant varieties in both conventional and conservation tillage systems for standard row (102cm) and narrow row (38cm) cotton planting patterns. The experiment was conducted during the 2004-2006 growing seasons at the Field Crops Unit, E.V. Smith Research Center, near Shorter, AL in long-term tillage plots. Data collection included plant populations within row spacings, plant biomass and height at 1st square, mid-bloom, and lint yields. Plant biomass measured at 1st square and mid-bloom was affected by growing season with 38cm cotton plant biomass averaging 34% greater in 2004 and 2005, however, the effect of tillage system was contradictory within the growing season. Mid-bloom plant biomass also varied across growing seasons with 21% more plant biomass recorded in 38cm rows averaged across all three growing seasons. Plant heights were shorter for 38cm cotton compared to 102cm cotton, regardless of growth stage or tillage system. No differences in cotton development were observed across varieties. Cotton planted in 38cm rows yielded equivalent to 102cm cotton during two of the three experimental years and was superior to 102cm cotton the remaining year, which corresponded to the best growing season observed during the experimental period. These results indicate that 38cm cotton production can produce yields that are at least equivalent to standard 102cm cotton, despite differences in plant development. The productivity of a narrow row cotton production system may be attractive to some growers, but economic evaluations are required to determine if the system is profitable on a large scale based on equivalent or marginal lint yield increases.</abstract>

    <title>Genotype×environment interactions for chilling tolerance of rice recombinant inbred lines under different low temperature environments</title>
    <abstract>Chilling injury is one of the major environmental stresses in rice cultivation in high-latitude and high-altitude regions. In this study, we cultivated a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Milyang 23 (indica)/Tong 88-7 (japonica) crosses in Kunming (high-altitude location), Yanji (high-latitude location), Chuncheon (cold water irrigation), and Suwon (normal) to evaluate the genotype×environment (G×E) interactions for chilling tolerance. RILs were the most severely damaged under the natural chilling air temperatures in Kunming. Significant G×E interactions in all measured agronomic traits were detected, and thus, the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) statistical model was applied to dissect the G×E interactions. The biplots of grand mean and IPCA1 (interaction principal component axes) of chilling-related traits accounted for most of the total treatment sums of squares. The IPCA scores of spikelet fertility and phenotypic acceptability were relatively smaller in Chuncheon than in Yanji and Kunming, implying that the screening for chilling tolerance with cold water irrigation in Chuncheon was more stable, whereas the Yanji and Kunming plantings were more sensitive to G×E interactions for chilling tolerance. These results demonstrate that multi-locational screening should be the best strategy for developing widely adaptable chilling-tolerant varieties in rice.</abstract>

    <title>Panicle architecture and grain number in irrigated rice, grown under different water management regimes</title>
    <abstract>In water-saving culture, rice yield is often determined by panicle size (number of grains per panicle). The objective of this study was to relate panicle morphology to plant growth factors in conventional flooded and aerobic rice culture. Rice plants were grown in non-puddled, unsaturated soils in aerobic culture, with the soil water potential at 20-cm depth kept above −60kPa. We examined four panicle traits—number of florets per panicle (FPP), number of primary branches per panicle (BPP), number of florets per primary branch (FPB), and frequency of pre-anthesis floret abortion (FA)—of four cultivars (Takanari, Akihikari, Lemont, IRAT109). FPP ranged from 111 to 459, and was affected more by FPB than by BPP. Branches per unit area were significantly correlated with the crop N content at the branch formation stage, whereas FPB was not significantly correlated with the N increase during floret differentiation. The relationship between florets per unit area and the crop N content at 2 weeks before anthesis differed considerably among cultivars, and floret production efficiency per unit N in each cultivar was affected by FPB. FA ranged from 5% to 55%, and was associated with the ratio of biomass increase during the 2-week period preceding anthesis to (floret number×floret weight). The relationship between the growth factors and the panicle traits appeared to be identical in flooded and aerobic culture. Based on these results, we propose that rice models for conventional flooded culture could be used to predict grain number in water-saving culture.</abstract>

    <title>Sowing date and nitrogen fertilisation effects on dry matter and nitrogen dynamics for durum wheat: An experimental and simulation study</title>
    <abstract>The effects of sowing date and nitrogen (N) fertilisation on the dynamics of dry matter (DM) and N accumulation during grain filling and on final grain yield and protein concentration for durum wheat were studied in two field experiments. In addition, the ability of the wheat simulation model SiriusQuality1 to simulate grain yield and protein concentration for durum wheat was evaluated. The model simulated the anthesis date and the grain filling duration with a root mean square error of 1.7 and 2.2 days, respectively. The model simulated reasonably well the changes in the dynamics of leaf, stem and grain DM and N in response to sowing date and N fertilisation. Harvest grain yield and protein concentration were simulated with a root mean square error of 0.045kgDMm⁻² and 1.25%, respectively. The longer vegetative period with autumn sowing compared with winter sowing resulted in higher crop DM and N at anthesis, which was associated with higher final grain yield. Independently of the sowing date or N fertilisation, post-anthesis DM accumulation contributed 70% to final grain yield. Post-anthesis N accumulation contributed between 25% and 40% to final grain N yield depending on the sowing date and N fertilisation. The efficiency of vegetative DM and N remobilisation was not modified by the sowing date or N fertilisation, averaging 21% and 74%, respectively. Sowing date had larger effects on grain DM yield than on grain N yield and grain protein concentration was significantly higher for the late sowing date than for the normal sowing date. N treatments did not affect crop phenology, but N fertilisation allowed the crops accumulating more DM and N during the vegetative period. In addition, high-N crops, because of their larger canopy, accumulated more DM and N during grain filling than low-N crops, resulting in higher grain yield and protein concentration at harvest. Both grain number per unit ground area and grain yield were closely correlated with crop DM and N at anthesis. Single grain DM was not modified by N availability. Averaged across N treatments, single grain DM varied from 44.2 to 57.3mgDMgrain⁻¹. These variations were almost entirely accounted for by the mean daily maximum temperature calculated for the 15 days prior to anthesis, suggesting that the temperature during the period of active cell division in the ovary is a major determinant of the final size of durum wheat grains.</abstract>

    <title>Heritability of aflatoxin resistance traits and correlation with drought tolerance traits in peanut</title>
    <abstract>Drought tolerance can be an effective tool for improving aflatoxin resistance in peanut. We evaluated 140 peanut families from 4 crosses in the F₄:₇ and F₄:₈ generations in field trials under drought and non-drought conditions to investigate the heritability (h ²) of aflatoxin resistance traits, and phenotypic (r P ) and genotypic (r G ) correlations between aflatoxin resistance and drought tolerance traits. Data were collected for seed infection by Aspergillus flavus, aflatoxin contamination, biomass, pod yield, drought tolerance index (DTI) of biomass (BIO), DTI of pod yield (PY), harvest index (HI), SPAD chlorophyll meter reading (SCMR) and specific leaf area (SLA). High genotype x environment interactions and low to moderate h² for seed infection and aflatoxin contamination (0.30 to 0.65) were observed, indicating difficulty with directly improving these traits. However, seed infection and aflatoxin contamination had significant negative r G with drought tolerance traits, especially with pod yield (-0.29** to-0.93**) under drought conditions, indicating that genotype selection for drought tolerance could improve aflatoxin resistance. Moreover, r G were strong between seed infection and aflatoxin contamination with HI (-0.33** to-0.89**), SLA (0.50** to 0.92**) and SCMR (-0.60** to-0.83**). The results indicate that HI, SLA, or SCMR traits under long-term drought conditions could be used as indirect indicators of aflatoxin resistance. Because measurements for SLA and SCMR are simple, realizable and rapid, SLA and SCMR may be practical and cost effective for application in large scale breeding programs.</abstract>

    <title>Diapause disruption with tebufenozide for early-instar control of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana</title>
    <abstract>In North America, the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem., is an important coniferous pest against which tebufenozide has proven effective as a control product. By acting as an ecdysone agonist, tebufenozide can induce precocious moulting in late (fifth-sixth) instars but can also be carried over to the next generation owing to its persistence on foliage. The authors conducted laboratory experiments on first-instar larvae treated with tebufenozide dissolved in acetone. Larvae exposed to doses equal to or above 0.1 µg cm-2 displayed precocious moulting in the second instar after hibernaculum spinning, which effectively disrupted diapause. Larger doses induced moulting in first instars. Evidence is provided that this dose-response difference is related to whether or not an effective dose of tebufenozide is ingested by the first instar prior to the peak of moulting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone) in first instars. Doses ineffective to kill first instars are carried over to the second instar, where they induce a precocious moult. This type of response to tebufenozide is dependent on the presence of a moulting machinery (the EcR-USP receptor complex) that is ready for ecdysone transduction. Interestingly, ecdysone levels are low in second instars, as measured by a radioimmunoassay, which suggests that diapause in spruce budworm is maintained by a suppression of ecdysone production. Thus, diapause disruption by tebufenozide may well provide an alternative control strategy for this important pest.</abstract>

    <title>Novel life stage targets against plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), in apple integrated pest management</title>
    <abstract>In this study the authors employed the plant-insect-chemistry (PIC) triad to investigate two novel life stage targets against the plum curculio (PC), Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), in apple integrated pest management (IPM). Laboratory treated apple bioassays were used to determine if the insect growth regulator (IGR) insecticides novaluron and tebufenozide have physiological effects on PC larvae following adult exposure. Curative activity bioassays were conducted for IGR, neonicotinoid, oxidiazine and organophosphate insecticides on PC larvae post-infestation, and fruit penetration profiles of insecticides were developed. The results revealed that novaluron exhibits activity on PC larvae via vertical transmission following exposure of mated females to treated substrate. Surface treatments of azinphos-methyl, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam to preinfested fruit resulted in significant reductions in larval emergence. For all compounds, 50% or more of the total recovered active ingredient was from apple skin, and for azinphos-methyl, indoxacarb and thiamethoxam it was greater than 80%. For azinphos-methyl, novaluron, methoxyfenozide and thiacloprid, however, active ingredient was recovered from every section of the apple, from skin to core. Implications for twenty-first century IPM are discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Effect of pyriproxyfen on developing stages and embryogenesis of California red scale (CRS), Aonidiella aurantii</title>
    <abstract>During the past decade, the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen has been the most used insecticide for controlling the California red scale (CRS), Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell), an important pest in citrus groves worldwide. The aim of the present research was to develop bioassays for determining the effect of pyriproxyfen on developing stages and embryogenesis of CRS that can serve as baselines for monitoring resistance. Pyriproxyfen was very effective against first- and second-instar nymphs of a susceptible strain of CRS; 0.1 and 0.2 mg AI L-1, resulting in 80 and 100% mortality of first-instar nymphs, and in 62.5 and 91.7% mortality of second-instar nymphs respectively. According to probit analysis, the LC50 and LC90 values of pyriproxyfen for first-instar nymphs were 0.03 and 0.15 mg AI L-1, and for second-instar nymphs they were 0.05 and 0.25 mg AI L-1 respectively. Pyriproxyfen was quite effective on first-instar nymphs of a CRS field strain originating from a citrus grove where two successive applications of the compound had been applied. Mortality rates were 86 and 100% at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 mg AI L-1 respectively. Pyriproxyfen suppressed embryogenesis when CRS females were treated with pyriproxyfen. Young CRS females treated with 1.0 and 5.0 mg AI L-1 pyriproxyfen produced 6.6 N1/F and 2.4 N1/F as compared with 10.9 N1/F in untreated control.</abstract>

    <title>Current status of the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum, susceptibility to neonicotinoid and conventional insecticides on strawberries in southern California</title>
    <abstract>Since 1998, the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), has emerged as a major insect pest of many horticultural crops in coastal California. Control of this pest has been heavily dependent upon chemical insecticides. Objectives of this study were to determine the status of the greenhouse whitefly susceptibility to neonicotinoid and conventional insecticides on strawberries in Oxnard/Ventura, a year-round intensive horticultural production area of southern California. For bioassay tests, adult whiteflies were collected from commercial strawberry crops, and immatures were directly developed from eggs laid by these adults. LD50 values of soil-applied imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and dinotefuran were respectively 8.7, 3.2 and 4.9 times higher for the adults, 1.8, 1.2 and 1.5 times higher for the first-instar nymphs and 89.4, 390 and 10.4 times higher for the third-instar nymphs than their top label rates. LC50 values of foliar-applied imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and acetamiprid were respectively 6.1, 6.0 and 1.7 times higher for the adults and 3.8, 8.7 and 4.4 times higher for the second-instar nymphs than their top label rates. For the adults, LC90 values of endosulfan, malathion, methomyl, bifenthrin and fenpropathrin were 2.2, 1.2, 1.9, 2.3 and 4.9 times lower than their respective top label rates. Chlorpyrifos was not very effective against the adults, as indicated by its LC90 being 120% higher than its top label rate. The present results strongly emphasize the need to develop resistance management strategies in the region.</abstract>

    <title>Integrated control of pests in tropical and subtropical sweet pepper production</title>
    <abstract>Sweet pepper is now grown, in tropical and subtropical areas, under the integrated pest management (IPM) tactic of physical barrier, whereas it was once grown primarily in open fields. This management tactic, when properly employed, has the advantage of eliminating many of the larger open-field pests, and has resulted in greatly increased pepper yields. However, certain other pest populations are exacerbated by this IPM tactic. This paper reviews the primary pests and current control tactics in sweet pepper.</abstract>

    <title>Reversal of resistance to pyriproxyfen in the Q biotype of Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae)</title>
    <abstract>Pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone (JH) mimic, is a biorational insecticide that disrupts insect development. It is one of the principal insecticides being used to control Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) on cotton, and has many environmentally positive attributes that make it compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In Israel, a high level of resistance to pyriproxyfen has been observed in several isolated regions. Here, tests were conducted to establish whether temporal refuges from exposure to pyriproxyfen could be useful for restoring the effectiveness of the compound. Resistance was found to decrease by a factor of 8 when exposure to pyriproxyfen was ceased for 13 generations. Reversal of resistance was accompanied with increased biotic fitness of the revertant colony. By incorporating experimental estimates of nymph survival, sex ratio, fecundity, egg hatching rate and developmental time, the seasonal cost per generation for resistant insects was estimated to be 25%. A genetic simulation model, optimized by empirical data from bioassays, predicted fitness cost per generation of 19% for resistant homozygous (RR) females and hemizygous (R) males, and produced rates of reversal similar to the experimental results. The model also predicted that, even after 5 years (55 generations) without pyriproxyfen treatments, the frequency of the resistance allele (R) will still remain high (0.02). It is therefore concluded, on the basis of experimental and modeling results, that the effectiveness of temporal refuges for reversing development of resistance to pyriproxyfen in B. tabaci may be limited.</abstract>

    <title>Pest management programmes in vineyards using male mating disruption</title>
    <abstract>Israeli vine growers have been reluctant to adopt the mating disruption technique for control of the European vine moth, Lobesia botrana Den. & Schiff. Since the chemically controlled honeydew moth, Cryptoblabes gnidiella Mill., coexists with the European vine moth, growers have maintained that the use of mating disruption would fail to bring about a significant reduction in pesticide use. In this study, the efficacy of mating disruption techniques against C. gnidiella was tested, as well as the effect of these methods on pesticide use and damage to clusters when the method was employed against both of the pests in wine grapes. Comparisons were made between plots treated with (1) L. botrana mating disruption pheromone, (2) L. botrana and C. gnidiella mating disruption pheromones and (3) control plots. A significant difference in the number of clusters infested with the developmental stages of the moths was seen between pheromone-treated plots and controls, while no such difference was observed between plots treated with one versus two pheromones. A similar pattern was observed in the number of insecticide applications; the greatest number of applications was used in control plots, followed by plots treated with L. botrana mating disruption pheromone and by plots treated with pheromones against both pests, in which no pesticides were applied.</abstract>

    <title>Gene expression in pyriproxyfen- resistant Bemisia tabaci Q biotype</title>
    <abstract>Pyriproxyfen is a biorational insecticide that acts as a juvenile hormone (JH) analogue and disrupts insect development with an unknown molecular mode of action. Pyriproxyfen is one of the major insecticides used to control the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) and comply with integrated pest management (IPM) programmes, resulting in minimal effects on the environment, humans and beneficial organisms. During the last few years, resistance to pyriproxyfen has been observed in several locations in Israel, sometimes reaching a thousandfold or more. No information exists about the molecular basis underlying this resistance that may lead to understanding the mode of action of pyriproxyfen and developing molecular markers for rapid monitoring of resistance outbreaks. In this communication, a cDNA microarray from B. tabaci was used to monitor changes in gene expression in a resistant B. tabaci population. Based on statistical analysis, 111 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified that were differentially upregulated in the resistant strain after pyriproxyfen treatment. Many of the upregulated ESTs observed in the present study belong to families usually associated with resistance and xenobiotic detoxification such as mitochondrial genes, P450s and oxidative stress, genes associated with protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and others related to JH-associated processes in insects such as oocyte and egg development.</abstract>

    <title>Uptake of pesticides from water by curly waterweed Lagarosiphon major and lesser duckweed Lemna minor</title>
    <abstract>The uptake of pesticides from water by two aquatic plants, the submersed Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss and the floating duckweed Lemna minor L., was measured over periods of up to 72 h. Twelve non-ionised pesticides and analogues, chosen to span a wide range of physicochemical properties, and one analogue (3,5-D) of the phenoxyacetic acid herbicide 2,4-D were studied. Concentrations of the parent compound were determined in the plants following extraction and separation by chromatography. Quantification was by liquid scintillation counting for the 14C-labelled compounds and by high-performance liquid chromatography for the four non-radiolabelled commercial pesticides. Uptake for all compound and plant combinations had reached equilibrium by 24 h. Accumulation of compound in the plant could be described well for most non-ionised compounds by equilibration into the aqueous phase in the plant cells together with partitioning onto the plant solids, this latter process becoming dominant in Lagarosiphon for compounds with log Kow > 1 and in Lemna for compounds with log Kow > 1.8. Lipophilic compounds with log Kow > 4 were concentrated more than 100-fold on a fresh-weight basis. However, the uptake of isoproturon and chlorotoluron was up to threefold less than expected from their Kow values, and their behaviour was better explained using solvation descriptors. Uptake of the acid 3,5-D was dependent on solution pH, this compound being strongly taken up at lower pH by the process of ion trapping, as previously observed in barley roots. Aquatic vegetation can thus rapidly accumulate pesticides, and could be an important sink especially for lipophilic pesticides reaching well-vegetated waters.</abstract>

    <title>Uptake and translocation of non-ionised pesticides in the emergent aquatic plant parrot feather Myriophyllum aquaticum</title>
    <abstract>The uptake of four 14C-labelled non-ionised compounds, the methyl carbamoyloxime insecticide/nematicide oxamyl and three model phenylureas, from solution by rooted stems of the aquatic plant parrot feather [Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verdc], together with translocation to the emergent shoots, was measured over periods of 24 and 48 h. Uptake into the submerged tissues of roots and stem base could be ascribed to two processes: movement into the aqueous phase of cells and then partitioning onto the plant solids. This latter process was related to lipophilicity (as measured by the l-octanol/water partition coefficient, Kow) and gave rise to high uptake rates of the most lipophilic compounds. Translocation to shoots was passive and was optimal at log Kow approximately 1.8, at which the efficiency of translocation of compound was about 40% of that of water. This optimum log Kow was identical to that observed previously in barley, although the translocation efficiency was somewhat less in parrot feather. Solvation parameters were applied to model uptake and translocation of a set of ten compounds by barley with the particular objective of understanding why translocation efficiency is lower at log Kow > 1.8.</abstract>

    <title>Piperonyl butoxide induces the expression of cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase genes in Drosophila melanogaster</title>
    <abstract>Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is an insecticide synergist known to inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. PBO is currently used in some insecticide formulations, and has also been suggested as a pretreatment for some pesticide applications. Little is known about how insects respond to PBO exposure at the gene transcription level. The authors have characterised the transcriptional response of the Drosophila melanogaster genome after PBO treatment, using both a custom-designed detox microarray, containing cytochrome P450 (P450), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase genes, and a full genome microarray. A subset of P450 and GST genes is identified, along with additional metabolic genes, that are induced by PBO. The gene set is an extremely similar gene set to that induced by phenobarbital, a compound for which pretreatment is known to confer tolerance to a range of insecticide compounds. The implications of the induction of gene families known to metabolise insecticides and the use of PBO in pest management programs are discussed.</abstract>

    <title>Juvenile hormonal activity of mono- and polyenehomobenzenes in Drosophila virilis, Spodoptera frugiperda and Araschnia levana</title>
    <abstract>A series of mono- and polyenehomobenzenes was synthesised by a highly regioselective palladium-catalysed allylic alkylation of substituted and unsubstituted benzylic Grignard reagents employing catalytic amounts of catalyst and tested for juvenile hormone activity on the fruit fly Drosophila virilis Sturtevant (Diptera: Drosophilidae), on an important agricultural pest species, the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and on the map butterfly Araschnia levana L. (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). In D. virilis only polyenehomobenzenes with a geranyl chain and a methyl, methoxy or isopropyl group at the para position of the aromatic ring displayed significant juvenile hormonal activity at low doses. A monoenehomobenzene and polyenehomobenzenes with longer allylic chains or without a substituted aromatic ring were not active. In S. frugiperda and in A. levana, a mono-, a di- and a tetraene displayed juvenile hormonal activity. In the lepidopteran species, a trend for the necessity of a substitution at position 4 of the phenyl group for high juvenile hormonal activity was also found.</abstract>

    <title>Propanil and swep inhibit 4-coumarate:CoA ligase activity in vitro</title>
    <abstract>4-Coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL, EC 6.2.1.12) in the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants has attracted interest as a novel target for developing effective plant growth inhibitors (PGIs). In a previous study in which the 4CL inhibitory activity of 28 existing herbicides was investigated using an optimized in vitro screening assay, 4CL activity was found to be strongly inhibited by propanil and swep at 100 µM. Here, further experimental evidence is provided to substantiate the previous result. Using 4-coumaric acid as substrate, tobacco 4CL activity was inhibited by propanil or swep in a concentration-dependent manner, with 50% inhibition concentrations (I50) of 39.6 and 6 µM respectively. These herbicides also exhibited uncompetitive inhibition towards 4-coumaric acid. Furthermore, 4CLs from several plant species were inhibited by the herbicides within a range from 1 to 50 µM. It is proposed that these herbicides have another site of action as a result of the inhibition of 4CL in the phenylpropanoid pathway, and this enzyme represents a new target site for the development of PGI.</abstract>

    <abstract>The susceptibility of 88 and 38 field samples of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) to imidacloprid and deltamethrin respectively was examined using the FAO dip test bioassay. The field samples were collected from tobacco and peach from various regions of Greece in the period from 2004 to 2006. In addition, 497, 349 and 370 clones originating from peach and tobacco were screened for the three known resistance mechanisms, elevated esterases, modified acetylcholinesterase (MACE) and knockdown resistance (kdr) respectively, using biochemical and DNA diagnostics. Most of the samples assayed with imidacloprid showed low resistance factors (RFs)-39% below 5 and 21% between 5 and 10. However, 9% of the samples (all from tobacco) showed relatively high RF values (24-73). Differences were found between crops, with higher RF values recorded in samples from tobacco than in those from peach. Bioassays with deltamethrin revealed the development of strong resistance in the populations examined. The RFs were mostly higher than 23, and in 29% of the samples they were extremely high (152-436). Finally, the three known resistance mechanisms were found in high frequencies in the populations examined, although some differences between crops and years were detected. The implications of the study for management schemes against M. persicae are discussed.</abstract>

    <title>A comparative evaluation of Origanum onites essential oil and its four major components as larvicides against the pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni Tams</title>
    <abstract>The pine processionary moth (PPM), Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni Tams. (Lepidoptera: Thaumatopoeidae), is an important forest pest in the Mediterranean area, and urticating hairs of the caterpillars of this species cause allergic reactions on skin of humans and animals. In the present study, the larvicidal activities of Turkish oregano (Origanum onites L.) essential oil and its four major components, carvacrol, gamma-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol and thymol, were evaluated against fourth/fifth-instar larvae of PPM under laboratory conditions. The essential oil was larvicidal to PPM with an LD50 value of 3800 µL L-1 when 0.1 mL was applied per larva. Carvacrol was the most toxic component found in the essential oil (LD50 = 3100 µL L-1), followed by thymol (LD50 = 5500 µL L-1). The other two components, gamma-terpinene and terpinen-4-ol, were less effective. The results showed that Turkish oregano essential oil and its two components, carvacrol and thymol, could be potential alternatives to synthetic insecticides for the control of PPM.</abstract>

    <title>Poultry Litter Application Increases Nitrogen Cycling Compared with Inorganic Nitrogen Fertilization</title>
    <abstract>POULTRY LITTER, an inexpensive source of nutrients and available in abundant amounts in the southeastern USA, may increase N cycling and reduce N losses compared with inorganic N fertilization if applied for crop production. We evaluated the effect of long-term application of poultry litter and inorganic N fertilizer on crop N uptake, soil N fractions, and N losses in conservation and conventional tillage with or without cover crop at the 0- to 20-cm depth in a Decatur silt loam (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Paleudults) in northern Alabama. Treatments were incomplete factorial combinations of three tillage practices [no-till (NT), mulch till (MT), and conventional till (CT)], two cropping systems [cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)–cotton–corn (Zea mays L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.)/cotton–rye/cotton–corn], and two N fertilization sources and rates (0 and 100 kg N ha–1 from NH4NO3 and 100 and 200 kg N ha–1 from poultry litter). Nitrogen fractions were soil total N (STN), particulate organic N (PON), microbial biomass N (MBN), potential N mineralization (PNM), NH4–N, and NO3–N. Crop N uptake varied among treatments and years and total uptake from 1997 to 2005 was greater in rye/cotton–rye/cotton–corn than in cotton–cotton–corn and greater with NH4NO3 than with poultry litter at 100 kg N ha–1. After 10 yr, STN and PON contents at 0 to 20 cm were greater in NT with poultry litter than in other treatments, except in CT with poultry litter, resulting in N storage at 38 kg N ha–1 yr–1 with poultry litter compared with loss at 4 kg N ha–1 yr–1 with NH4NO3. The MBN, PNM, and NO3–N contents were greater with poultry litter than with NH4NO3, regardless of tillage. Calculation of estimated N balance showed that poultry litter conserved N at 191 to 556 kg N ha–1 compared with –75 to 201 kg N ha–1 with NH4NO3. Poultry litter application can increase soil N storage and mineralization and reduce the potential for N loss compared with inorganic N fertilization, thereby reducing the need for N fertilization and environmental N contamination.</abstract>

    <abstract>Lactic acid producing bacterial strain Probio-16 was isolated from the swine excrements under anaerobic conditions and characterized by morphology and biochemical characteristics. The strain was further identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogeneitc analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the strain was assayed by testing for growth inhibition of thirteen pathogenic microorganisms. The strain was tested for antiviral activity against porcine rotavirus in vitro in African green monkey epithelial cell line TF-104. Antibiotic susceptibility of the strain against 13 antibiotics was tested using disk diffusion method. Phenotypically and through 16S rRNA gene sequences, Probio-16 was identified and named as Lactobacillus reuteri Probio-16. This strain was resistant to pH 2.0, 5% porcine bile and exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the thirteen enteric bacterial pathogens tested. Probio-16 supernatant inhibited porcine rotavirus in vitro in TF-104 cell lines. Except for erythromycin and penicillin G at a concentration of 4 µg/ml, Probio-16 showed resistance to all other thirteen antibiotics tested. This study indicates L. reuteri Probio-16 as a novel strain with its tolerance to low pH and bile, antimicrobial activity, antibiotic resistance and antiviral activity against rotavirus, and an ideal probiotic candidate for animal and human application after the proper in vivo experiments.</abstract>

    <title>Analysis of synonymous codon usage in foot-and-mouth disease virus</title>
    <abstract>In this study, we calculate the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values and codon usage bias (CUB) values to carry out a comparative analysis of codon usage pattern for open reading frames (ORFs) among 85 samples which belong to all seven serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Although the degree of CUB for ORFs is a relatively slight, there is a significant variation for CUB among different serotypes, which is mainly determined by codon usage pattern depending on RSCU. By comparison with RSCU values for all samples, although RSCU values fail to show the relationship of specific-lineage serotype, there are two main genetic populations existing in FMDV, namely (i) serotypes Asia 1, A, C &O; (ii) serotypes SAT 1, 2 & 3. This interesting characteristic may be formed by the mechanism of RNA virus recombination. The analysis of quantitative & qualitative evaluation based on CUB indicates interesting characteristic of codon usage, which suggests that more FMDV genome diversity may exist in specific-lineage serotypes rather than exist randomly. Furthermore, the relationship between amino acids and codon usage pattern indicates that mutation pressure rather than translational selection in nature is the important determinant of the codon usage bias observed. Our work might give some sight into some characteristics of FMDV ORF and some evolutionary information of this virus.</abstract>

    <title>A web-based decision support system to enhance IPM programs in Washington tree fruit</title>
    <abstract>BACKGROUND: Integrated pest management (IPM) decision-making has become more information intensive in Washington State tree crops in response to changes in pesticide availability, the development of new control tactics (such as mating disruption) and the development of new information on pest and natural enemy biology. The time-sensitive nature of the information means that growers must have constant access to a single source of verified information to guide management decisions.RESULTS: The authors developed a decision support system for Washington tree fruit growers that integrates environmental data [140 Washington State University (WSU) stations plus weather forecasts from NOAA], model predictions (ten insects, four diseases and a horticultural model), management recommendations triggered by model status and a pesticide database that provides information on non-target impacts on other pests and natural enemies. A user survey in 2008 found that the user base was providing recommendations for most of the orchards and acreage in the state, and that users estimated the value at $ 16 million per year.CONCLUSIONS: The design of the system facilitates education on a range of time-sensitive topics and will make it possible easily to incorporate other models, new management recommendations or information from new sensors as they are developed.

    <title>Residues of the herbicide fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, its agronomic safener isoxadifen-ethyl and their metabolites in rice after field application</title>
    <abstract>BACKGROUND: Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl is a herbicide used on cereals and in particular on rice, the degradation of which leads to several relevant metabolites. The herbicide is used together with an agronomic safener such as isoxadifen-ethyl, which also generates some metabolites. The present work was aimed at developing and validating an analytical method for the determination of the above parent compounds and their main metabolites in the edible fractions of rice. Parent compounds were extracted in acetonitrile and determined by gas chromatography with a mass spectrometer detector, while metabolites were extracted in acetonitrile and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.RESULTS: The method was validated through recovery tests in rice straw, grain and plant: accuracy was in the range 76-86% and 90-103% for parent compounds and metabolites respectively. Precision, as relative standard deviation, was in the range 3-11% and 6-17% for parent compounds and metabolites respectively. The limit of detection was 0.01 mg kg⁻¹ for each analyte, while the limit of quantification was set at 0.05 mg kg⁻¹.CONCLUSION: The analytical method is suitable for quantitative determination of each analyte considered in rice commodities.

Attachment I – Statement of work



1.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION



The National Agricultural Library (NAL) produces the AGRICOLA database, (), which is an online bibliographic database that contains over 5 million entries on the topic of agriculture.    AGRICOLA is composed of the AGRICOLA Catalog and the AGRICOLA Index.   The AGRICOLA Index is an abstract and indexing service for agricultural literature and primarily contains technical journal articles and research reports.



The controlled vocabulary used for subject indexing of the AGRICOLA Index is the NAL Agricultural Thesaurus (NALT) ().  NALT uses the standard thesaurus relationships in the ANSI/NISO Z39.19 standard and contains over 82,000 terms with 60% descriptors and 40% lead-in terminology. NALT is organized into 17 top subject categories and is polyhierarchical. The NALT is updated annually with publication in January of each year.  NALT is in the public domain and the complete data files are freely available for downloading from the thesaurus web site in multiple formats ().  



The assignment of subject retrieval terms in the AGRICOLA Index (aka “subject indexing”) is currently performed entirely by human indexers. Annual production of the AGRICOLA Index is limited to 75,000 articles each year with the current scenario. NAL’s strategic goal is to significantly increase (400%) the number of articles indexed each year while achieving a baseline quality standard. To accomplish this goal, an increase in publisher-supplied data and the acquisition of automated indexing software is being sought as the solution. The ultimate goal is to implement the automated indexing software as an automatic indexing system with human quality review, and not just as a machine-aided indexing system for human indexers.  



The automatic indexing system envisioned would be an internal operation which will be housed on NAL servers and run by NAL staff.  After an initial software configuration/customization and staff training, NAL staff should be able to run the indexing operation without continuously requiring contractor services in order to maintain baseline quality and quantity levels.



The software XML records containing the basic bibliographic metadata (at minimum, title and abstract) for each journal article will be processed by the application and subject retrieval terms from the NALT will be assigned.  The application will be sufficiently flexible to allow modifications by NAL staff and the contractor to improve its performance. 





2.   PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE

2.1 Overall Objective

NAL wants to acquire commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) automated indexing software that will enable 6 in-house indexers to subject index 300,000 articles per year.  The software will apply the NAL Agricultural Thesaurus terms.  The accuracy of automated indexing (f-score based on precision and recall measurements) should be a minimum of .60 or should increase at least by .20 over the selection test results (with a minimum acceptable value of .55) after a 3-month period of software configuration by the contractor working with NAL staff.

2.2 Specific Objective

The specific purpose is to acquire commercial off-the-shelf automated indexing software and the associated services necessary for the successful implementation and continued support of that software at NAL, including:

Contractor analysis of the NAL indexing scenario and recommendations for the selection and configuration of contractor-supplied products to achieve quality and quantity goals,

Contractor assistance with configuration of the AI software based on accepted recommendations made in the contractor analysis,

Training of IT staff for the deployment of the software and maximum performance in the NAL IT environment,

Training of NAL Indexers on methods to improve automatic indexing quality (i.e. rule creation, creation of custom knowledge extraction processes, training sets, etc.),

Training of NAL thesaurus staff on the administration and incorporation of thesaurus data into the application and on the methods for updating, and

Telephone and email support for the automated indexing application after the initial warranty period, and

Delivery of upgraded application software entering general customer release.

TERM

DEFINITION

AGRICOLA Index

The AGRICOLA Index is an online database of bibliographic citations to the agricultural literature. It contains over 5 million entries describing articles and reports authored over the last 40 years. http://agricola.nal.usda.gov

Controlled vocabulary

A structured list of specific subject terms used to describe concepts. The subject terms comprise preferred and non-preferred terms, with the non-preferred terms cross-referenced to the preferred terms.  The use of a controlled vocabulary enables consistent indexing and search and retrieval based on the subject.

f-score or f-measure

An accuracy measurement of indexing quality.

                             Recall x Precision

F measure = 2 x ---------------------------

                            Recall + Precision

 

Lexical analysis

Also known as "lexical processing", it includes lemmatization (aka "stemming") and the morphological analysis of words, such as plural versus singular.

NALT

The National Agricultural Library Thesaurus - a polyhierarchical thesaurus of subject terms covering the field of agriculture.   It has over 80,000 terms, of which over 58% are core terms and the remainder terms are cross-references.

Precision

# of hits divided by the total number of terms assigned by the computer software.

Recall

# of hits divided by the total number of terms assigned by the human indexer.

Semantic analysis

Assignment of words to semantic categories or types.  Requires a semantic type lexicon in the domain.

Syntactic analysis

Assigning words to syntactic categories (e.g. part of speech)

Tokenization

Process where text is broken into the basic units of language, such as words or lexemes.

XML

eXtensible Markup Language (XML) - a W3C specification for encoding documents in a machine readable form - http://www.w3.org/XML/.  NAL receives many of its data records in XML format using the NLM MedLine DTD.
