This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for
Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement
constitutes the only solicitation; Firm Fixed-Priced quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The
solicitation number is NAMA-14-Q-0009 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and
clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-70 effective September 30, 2013. This acquisition is restricted.  This
acquisition is set aside 100% for small business.  The NAICS code and the small business size standard are NAICS 423430, Computer and Computer
Peripheral Equipment and other similar NAICS codes. The size standard for these NAICS is 100 employees. The Offerors must state in their quote
their size standard for this procurement. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the
agency. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a purchase order(s) with firm fixed-priced contract line items
(CLINs).  EVALUATION: The Government reserves the right to award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement.  Evaluation and
award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR 13.5 in conjunction with Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations
or Offers, Award and Documentation and in accordance with the guidance at FAR 12.301(c)(2).  A purchase order will be issued to the
Contractor(s) whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this procurement
will be obtained through a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation.  For evaluation purposes, the firm-fixed price for each CLIN will be
determined by multiplying the Unit Price by the Quantity of units, and the Total fixed price will be determined by summing the firm-fixed price
of all CLINs.  Contractors must provide pricing for each CLIN, including any Option CLINs.  The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-
shelf items.  Section 508 Evaluation Factors- Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for receipt of the purchase order(s) after
it has been determined that the quotation adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508.  Only quotations which contain adequate
information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed Government Product/Service Accessibility Template
(GPAT)[1], VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.  In order to facilitate a
comprehensive Government evaluation, contractors quoting “Or Equal” products are required to submit itemized technical specifications for CLIN
0001 on form Attachment 3.  Additionally, contractors quoting “Or Equal” products are required to provide with their quote: 1) Documentation
demonstrating the compatibility of the quoted “Or Equal” product(s) with NARA’s network software as required by the Salient Characteristics.  At
a minimum this documentation must include: the date completed; name, position, and contact information of the person(s) conducting the
verification; and methodology of configuring the “Or Equal” product to function with NARA’s network; and 2) Documentation demonstrating that the
quoted “Or Equal” product’s capability to comply with the label printing requirement as required by the Salient Characteristics; this
documentation must include: the date completed; name, position, and contact information of the person(s) conducting the testing; and results of
the testing.  The Government may contact the person to verify the performance results.  This requirement is of utmost importance considering the
potentially devastating production issues that would result from latently non-compatible items.  BACKGROUND: The purpose of this acquisition is
to purchase HP M425dn Laserjet Pro Multi- Function Printers for the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) located in St. Louis, MO.
REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination pricing is requested for each CLIN, all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed price.  See

2014.  AFFIRMATION STATEMENTS: Contractors must confirm in their quote that all products quoted meet the Energy Star® energy use requirements.
All items quoted must be IPv6 compliant.  Section 508 Program Need - Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: "Multifunction Machines."  Section 508 Deliverable
Requirements - Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents
must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as

Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and

Multifunction Machines delivered as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508
requirements for accessibility.  Multifunction Machines delivered must include a completed GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of this
solicitation.   Contractors must complete and return RFQ Attachment 1, Required Quote Information.  It is the Contractor’s responsibility to
ensure that NARA is not provided either counterfeit or grey market products.  In the event that such IT products are determined to be
counterfeit or grey market, NARA will seek all available legal remedies including criminal prosecution.  Counterfeit information technology
product means any item of information technology (IT), including hardware and software that is an unauthorized copy, replica, or substitute.  A
grey market or gray market also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are
unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer[2].  As a result manufacturers will not honor associated warranties and
service agreements.  Unless you, the Vendor, are authorized by the manufacturer to resell the particular items you are quoting in the USA, it is
in your best interest as well as the Government’s that you simply do not respond.  NARA will verify with the manufacturers immediately upon
order issuance that the Contractor is an authorized reseller for this buy.  Any issues with the information provided by the manufacturer to the
Government about the grey market status of the items must be addressed by the Contractor to the manufacturer.  The Government will immediately
cancel any order based on a quotation of grey market items.  In an effort to further ensure NARA is receiving new, manufacturer approved OEM
items and will receive the benefits of any warranties or other manufacturer guarantees, NARA requires contractors to submit with their quote
proof in writing from the OEM manufacturer of their status as an authorized/certified OEM Contractor of the manufactured items.  Contractors
must complete and return Attachment 1, Required Quote Information, and Attachment 2, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT),
in order for their quotations to be considered. TAA COMPLIANCE: As this award is not expected to exceed the TAA compliance threshold, TAA
compliance is not required. QUESTIONS: Questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted in writing to Mr. Kevin Schumacher no later than 4:00 PM
ET on November 5, 2013 to be considered.  Questions submitted in any other manner will not be answered.  The Government will answer questions or
requests for clarification via a written RFQ amendment.  SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS:  One (1) copy of each quotation should be mailed to National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Attention: Mr. Kevin Schumacher NAMA-14-Q-0009, 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138 or e-mailed
to: kevin.schumacher@nara.gov Quotations should be received by 4:00 PM ET on November 16, 2013.  Failure to submit quotations by the due date
may result in rejection of the quotation as untimely Contractors submitting via e-mail are cautioned to allow one extra business day for
delivery and confirm receipt of quotation as the e-mail will need to pass through IT security.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) clauses are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price contract, with the exception of FAR provisions which
will be removed prior to issuance of the order: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jul 2013); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror

|The GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as |
|a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable    |
|Section 508 requirements. The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical        |
|sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth      |
|tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.                                                                              |

|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified |
|by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for  |
|this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT        |
|accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.                         |

Summary

 • Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each Section of
   the Standard is shown in parentheses.
 • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be features of
   the Contractor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the Contractor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable includes
   additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.
 • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
   deliverable.
 • Column four is a summary of the Contractor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
   Standard.
 • Column five is where the Contractor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
   applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.



    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the Contractor
      in providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the Contractor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the Contractor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is
      also an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.
