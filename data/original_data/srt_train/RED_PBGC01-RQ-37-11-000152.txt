SECTION 2. STATEMENT OF WORK PBGC is looking for an online, internet-based news content provider that can identify and deliver information about companies and organizations according to search protocols established by the end user. Each PBGC end user monitors approximately 200 pension plan sponsors. The end user is interested in news ­ financial and general ­ about pension plan sponsors that could affect the sponsors' ability to maintain their pension plans. PBGC's decisions are time sensitive. Therefore, the service provided must be capable of delivering relevant content to the end user within four hours after the content is posted by the news sources. PBGC requires a content provider to do the newsgathering for us and present the news in an easy to read on-line and/or e4

mail format. We expect up to 50 users to use the system. The period of performance is 9/1/2011 to 8/31/2012. Specific Requirements: 1. Make news available from a wide variety and number of trusted sources ­ small periodicals and trade journals as well as major publ ications ­within four hours after the content is posted by the news sources for the purposes of: a. Allowing the user to set up and receive real-time alerts concerning content posted about organizations or companies in which the user has an interest; and b. Allowing users to perform ad-hoc news searches and save the searches for future use. 2. Provide an easy-to-use user interface 3. Provide users with a daily customizable e-mail newsletter, categorized by company and/or topic. Needs to display the first few lines of the article in the body of the newsletters.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD-BEST VALUAR PROCUREMENT ­ RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNICAL FACTORS VERSUS PRICE FACTORS: The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government (i.e., that which represents the best value to the Government), price and other factors considered. Technical Ability and Past Performance are equally weighted and are significantly more important than Price.
1. Technical Ability ­ Ability of the contractor to meet the technical requirements

stated above. This must be demonstrated by providing a detailed description of the services offered that links the services offered to PBGC's stated requirements. In addition the vendors will be requested, if necessary, to demonstrate the product. 2. Past Performance ­ The offeror must provide PBGC with three references, to include the name, telephone number, and email address of a point of contact at each reference. Each reference must either be a current user of the proffered services or have used the services consistently within the past year. PBGC will use the following criteria to measure past performance: A. Quality of products and services; B. Timeliness of performance, to include problem resolution; and C. Customer service, to include responsiveness to customer requests & service calls and overall customer satisfaction
14

In evaluating past performance, PBGC is seeking to determine whether each offeror consistently delivers quality products and/or services in a timely manner with a reasonable degree of customer satisfaction. Therefore, this factor will be evaluated based on relevant Past Performance. Accordingly, the PBGC will evaluate the proposed Past Performance Information (PPI) based on information received and from the prospective contractor (references), and from any other reliable source available to the PBGC, such as an official Past Performance database and/or other Government and local agencies. Offerors without a record of relevant Past Performance will be given a neutral rating. 3. Price ­ The offeror's price will not be point scored, assigned a numerical weight, or adjectivally rated. Price offers will be evaluated for reasonableness and appropriateness of proposed amounts and to ensure the offeror understands the stated requirements. This is a firm fixed price. No further adjustments will be made.
