I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions: 1. By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 2. As used in the Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C. 522a, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. 3. I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of providing an investment accounting system to the Office of Public Debt Accounting. This approval will permit me conditional access to certain information, accounting data and/or to attend meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise made available to me. 4. I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information that is provided to me pursuant to this Agreement to anyone unless I have been advised in writing by the Bureau of Public Debt or in the case of bureau sensitive but unclassified information released to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) or Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), in accordance with a written arrangement related to the official audit/investigative functions of the OIG or TIGTA for that particular matter). Should I desire to make use of any sensitive but unclassified information, I will do so in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Agreement. I will submit to the Bureau of Public Debt for security review, prior to any submissions for publication, any book, article, column or other written work for general publication that is based upon any knowledge I obtained during the course of my work on the investment accounting system to ensure that no Bureau of Public Debt sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed. 5. I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. 6. Upon signing this non-disclosure agreement, I will be permitted access to official Bureau of Public Debt documents containing sensitive but unclassified information and understand that any copies must be protected in the same manner as the originals. Any notes taken during the course of such access must also be protected in the same manner as the originals. 7. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information could compromise the Bureau of Public Debt security. 8. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information. This may serve as a basis for my being denied conditional access to Bureau of Public Debt or other Treasury bureaus' information, both classified and sensitive but unclassified information in the future. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief. The willful disclosure of information to which I have agreed herein not to divulge may constitute a criminal offense. 9. Unless and until I am provided a written release by the Bureau of Public Debt from this Agreement or any portions of it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of my work on providing , and at all times thereafter.

10. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provisions of this Agreement unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 11. I understand that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. 12. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive but unclassified information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement. 13. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights or liabilities created by Executive Order 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.)(governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents), and the statutes that protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 128, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC Section 783 (b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling. 14. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or effect in any manner any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government except within the Department of the Treasury as noted in item 8, above. 15. I make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

MEMORANDUM
BUREAU OF THE PUBLIC DEBT DATE: TO: FROM: June 9, 2009 BPD Developers Division of Systems Development, Web and Application Services Branch

SUBJECT: Java coding standards effective September 1, 2009 Overview All Java source code developed by BPD, regardless of domain, is required to undergo a review prior to deployment to the production environment. Code review is necessary in order to ensure that BPD's inhouse developed code provides security, is of high quality, is consistent where necessary, is maintainable, and is optimized for performance. The designer must request a review after integration testing has been successfully completed by sending WEBCR an e-mail message requesting review, which must include a list of the files to be reviewed. This document delineates a set of minimum documentation, coding, and security standards required for all BPD Java source code. Once the review has been completed, the reviewer will provide the developer, project manager, developer's branch manager, ARM, ClearCase administrators, and the rest of the codereview team with the results of the review, noting deficiencies found in the code that must be corrected. A list of recommendations or "best practices" will be included at the end of the review document; such recommendations do not constitute deficiencies and will not prevent code from being migrated to production. While the standards are reviewed and updated on a semi-annual basis, it is possible that new or updated standards could be implemented at any time in accordance with mandates issued by Treasury or DSD management. Requirements for Java source files Documentation specifics 1. All Java code will have the following documentation components in a block, following this sequence: a. package statement following BPD IT Standard 3.3.3.1, Package Structure. b. nondisclosure statement c. any necessary import statements d. JavaDoc comment block which contains a brief class description, a usage example, and a complete change history section with date, developer name, iET/IT Initiative number, and optional comments. It is recommended that columns should be separated by spaces and kept aligned. The documentation block will use this format:

package gov.treas.publicdebt.zz.logic; // |\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/| // | | // | FOR OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT USE ONLY | // | U.S. TREASURY | // | BUREAU OF THE PUBLIC DEBT | // | | // | | // | You shall use this software component only in accordance with the terms | // | of the license agreement you entered into with U.S. TREASURY, BUREAU | // | OF THE PUBLIC DEBT. | // | | // |/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\| import package.AClass; import package.ASecondClass; import package.AThirdClass; /** * <p>Brief description of the class ...</p> *

* * <b>History:</b> * <pre> * Date: * 05/21/2001 * 10/15/2003 * 12/08/2003 * * 01/07/2004 * * * </pre> */

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

<b>Example:</b> <pre>

lValidate = new BusinessLogic(_rbProperties, _dDebug); ... saResults = lValidate.process(session); // Detail any errors if ((saResults == null) || (saResults.length == 0)) { // no validation errors ... } else { // contains validation errors errMessage = lValidate.getBaseMessage(); iMax = saResults.length; for (iOccurs = 0; iOccurs < iMax; iOccurs++) { if (_dDebug) { section.append("validation log msg="); section.append(saResults[iOccurs]); section.append("<br>\n"); } aiHistory.addElement("exception",saResults[iOccurs]); } aiHistory.setWrite(true); aiHistory.setResultCD("-3"); } </pre>

Author: S.Smith A.Jones L.Baker L.Baker

Changes: creation Applix #131047 Applix #192022 - Make the overloaded toString synchronized Applix #193215 - copied from gov.treas.publicdebt.fw.util WAS 5.0 Infrastructure Upgrade

public class MyClassName {

2. The lines shown in bold italicized type in the above JavaDoc example are required in utility classes and in classes containing public static methods. If the class contains only public static methods, the class-level example is to refer to the methods themselves for a usage example:
* * * * * * <b>Example:</b> <pre> Refer to the applicable method for an example. </pre>

The rest of the JavaDoc is required in all classes. 3. Filenames are not allowed in the nondisclosure block.

4. The nondisclosure statement must match the statement shown above; it cannot contain the words `copyright' or `proprietary.' 5. Import statements must come from DSD-approved WebSphere packages, JDK/Java extension packages, or from those classes published and listed in the OIT Object Library on PD Web. Usage of any other classes as imports must be reviewed by the object librarian and approved by DSD management prior to inclusion in the code. 6. Each import statement must be fully qualified, i.e. no wildcards such as an asterisk(*). 7. Each import statement must be used in the code; all unused import statements must be removed. 8. Duplicate import statements are not allowed. 9. Imports from the same package as the file in question are not allowed. 10. The documentation section must follow the format and content shown above, and it must pass the DocCheck utility without failure. Instructions for use of DocCheck can be found in the OIT Object Library on PD Web. 11. The change history must be complete and accurate. Each change history entry must include the date of the change, the developer's name, and the applicable iET/IT Initiative number. If an entry does not contain all three required elements, it will not be considered a change history entry. At the developer's discretion, an entry may also contain a brief description of the changes made. One entry between production versions is necessary; developers can add additional entries as desired. Previous change history entries cannot be deleted. 12. All methods must have JavaDoc; it must pass the DocCheck utility without failure, and it must follow this example:
/** * Produce the report to the specified RTF. * @param file Output RTF file name * @throws IOException When there are problems creating/writing to the file * @return java.util.ArrayList The search result to return to the calling method */ public ArrayList someMethod(String file) throws IOException { ... }

Note: methods which have a return type of void do not require the @return statement. All public class-level variables must have JavaDoc; it must pass the DocCheck utility without failure, and it must follow this example:
/** Duplicate Constant. */ public static final String DUPLICATE = " DUPLICATE ";

Coding specifics 1. Applications must be developed using a WebSphere-approved JDK compatible with the target production environment as specified in the ARM Implementing an Enterprise Application document. 2. Each class must be a separate file. At the developer's discretion, helper classes can be placed in the same file as the parent class. 3. Component placement within the package structure must match the purpose/usage of the component; for example, classes which generate the user interface must be placed within the UI package. Further details can be found in BPD IT Standard 3.3.3.1, Package Structure. 4. Services must be placed in the reusable objects library for component reuse.

5. Automatically-generated classes are exempt from review, with the exception of bean classes. 6. All servlet input parameters must be validated for legitimate character usage and excessive length. 7. Objects stored in HttpSession must implement Serializable to permit load balancing. 8. Fully-qualified objects cannot appear in the code unless uniqueness of name is not possible by using only the class name. Bean classes are exempt from this requirement. 9. Multiple appends to a String are not allowed; StringBuffers must be used. Static content is exempt from this requirement. 10. StringBuffers cannot use the default 16-character constructor; for example,
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();

is not allowed. The StringBuffer must be declared in a size sufficiently large to handle the data which will be appended to it without buffer resizing. 11. Collections objects must be declared in sizes sufficient to handle the data without object resizing. 12. Multiple objects/primitives cannot be declared on the same line; each one must be declared on its own line. 13. Objects/primitives cannot be declared and adjusted within the same instruction; for example,
int count += counter;

is not allowed. 14. Empty methods within a concrete class are not allowed; however, classes which require empty methods to comply with coding requirements and/or specifications, including bean classes, are allowed. 15. Empty catch blocks are not allowed; at a minimum, the exception message must be logged. Framework applications must send the exception message to the framework error log, and nonframework applications must send the exception message to Log4J or to the standard error file. At the developer's discretion, details relevant to the exception can be logged with the exception message. Functional code beyond logging of the exception message is not required. In instances where functional code beyond logging is not required, a comment must be included that explains why functionality beyond error message logging is not needed, as seen in this example:
try { . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . } catch(AddressException ae) { //additional action beyond exception message logging is not needed //because this exception is thrown only when the e-mail address fails //syntax validation according to the rules of RFC822 } System.err.println(ae);

16. System.out statements must be turned on and off with a boolean if- statement, and the value of the boolean must be controlled via a properties file entry or an LDAP entry. Classes which perform batch processing on the command line are exempt from this requirement. 17. Switch statements must have a default clause at the bottom of the statement, and the statement must contain a break, return, or throw statement. In cases where a default clause is not needed, the default clause must still be present, it still must contain a break, return, or throw statement, and a comment must be placed in the default clause explaining why the default clause is not being used.

18. Each case clause in a switch statement must end with a break, a return, or a throw statement. In situations where case clause fall-through is used, break/return/throw statements are not required; however, a comment must be added to the first empty case clause which explains the fall-through logic. 19. A method can have only one finally block, and it must be located at the end of the method. 20. The RandomAccessFile class can only be used when the file pointer must be moved to a specific position in a file. 21. File input/output and stream input/output operations must use buffers when such buffers are available for use. 22. File input/output and stream input/output operations must be closed as soon as they are completed. They must be closed and nulled within the same try- block of code where they are used. If the I/O object offers a flush() method, the object must be flushed prior to closure. If multiple I/O objects are being used in one try block, they must be closed and nulled in the opposite order of their creation and usage. The flushing, closing, and nulling of I/O objects must be repeated in an end-ofmethod finally block where the objects are tested for null and then flushed, closed, and nulled if the objects are found to not be null. 23. Database and LDAP connections must be closed as soon as they are no longer needed. They must be closed and nulled within the same try- block of code where they are used. If a special method is used to return a connection to a pool, the special method must be called per specification prior to nulling the object. Objects must be set to null after a connection is closed and released unless a specification forbids the nulling of such objects. The closing and nulling of connection objects must be performed in the opposite order of their creation and usage. The closing and nulling of connection objects must be repeated in an end-of-method finally block where the objects are tested for null and then closed/nulled if the objects are found to not be null. Requirements for properties files Documentation specifics 1. JavaDoc requirements do not apply to properties files. 2. Properties files are not required to have a filename in them; however, if a filename is present, it must be correct. 3. At the option of the developer, properties files can have a nondisclosure statement/change history section at the top of the file. Such a section is not required; however, if a nondisclosure statement/change history section is present, it must be accurate and up-to-date. The nondisclosure statement cannot contain the words `copyright' or `proprietary.' The change history section must be constructed like the change history section in the JavaDoc example above, and each entry must contain the applicable iET/IT Initiative number. 4. Applications using BPDLogin version 4.0 or later must document the BPDLogin properties file according to the requirements, content, and structure shown in Procedure to Request Access using BPDLogin. Coding specifics 1. Applications using BPDLogin version 4.0 or later must code the BPDLogin properties file according to the requirements, content, and structure shown in Procedure to Request Access using BPDLogin. 2. Aside from properties files used with BPDLogin version 4.0 or later, there are no coding specifics for properties files.

Requirements for XML-structured files Documentation specifics 1. JavaDoc requirements do not apply to XML files. 2. For security reasons, files using an XML structure cannot have a comment block/change history section. XML schemas must have a comment block/change history section, constructed as follows:
<xsd:annotation> <xsd:documentation>Bureau of the Public Debt Auction Schema</xsd:documentation> <xsd:documentation>07/31/2004 : Applix 120447 : author JDoe : Creation</xsd:documentation> <xsd:documentation>03/15/2005 : Applix 205662 : author JDoe : 'NewBidIncrement' element</xsd:documentation> <xsd:documentation>10/15/2006 : ITG #1779 : author JDoe : Changed 'NewBidIncrement' data type from 'xsd:float' to xsd:double'</xsd:documentation> </xsd:annotation>

Each change-history entry must have the date of the change, the applicable iET/ITG number, the author's name, and a brief description of the change. Each new entry is to be appended to the bottom of the change-history list. One history entry is required per production version. 3. Applications using BPDLogin version 4.0 or later must document the BPDLogin XML file according to the requirements, content, and structure shown in Procedure to Request Access using BPDLogin. Coding specifics 1. Pure XML files must be constructed according to the conventions maintained by Systems Design Branch. SDB can supply these conventions upon request. 2. Files using an XML structure which must be reviewed include pure XML files, files which contain data in an XML format, and files which contain SQL statements inside an XML format. LDAP entries are exempt from review. 3. Applications using BPDLogin version 4.0 or later must code the BPDLogin XML file according to the requirements, content, and structure shown in Procedure to Request Access using BPDLogin. Notes 1. A comments section will be included with each review. The section will contain suggestions concerning coding techniques which may conflict with the Java Programming Style Guide, located in the DSD Object Library on PDWeb, and known best coding practices. Items such as deprecated element usage, performance issues, difficult-to-maintain code, warnings, and recommendations for improvement will also be noted in the comments section. Items in the comments section are just that - comments; while developers are not required to address any comments made about the code, it is strongly suggested that such comments be addressed. Developers are advised that comments may be included in the next Java coding standards review period and could become standards in the future. 2. Waivers from the coding standards can be requested on a case-by-case basis. The requestor must use the e-mail waiver form, which is available from WEBCR. The requestor must list the date of the request, the party or parties requesting the waiver, the text of the standard for which a waiver is being requested(including the effective date of the standards document), the details of the business case for the waiver, and an expiration date for the waiver/reason why an expiration date is not needed. The requestor must send the waiver form to WEBCR for consideration, with a carbon copy sent to CCADMIN; WEBCR will then send it to the DSD director for approval. WEBCR will inform the requestor

as to the waiver's approval or disapproval. CC-ADMIN will retain a copy of the e-mail for record-keeping and auditing purposes.

BUREAU OF THE PUBLIC DEBT OIT STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) 6. Software Engineering 6.1. Applications 6.1.1. Application Build, Hosted 6.1.1.207 SQL Coding Standards Date Issued: *May 29, 2005 Date Last Reviewed: October 2010 Date Next Review: October 2011 *Formerly (Division-SOP file) DSD 3.4.7-SQL Coding Standards References: Approver: OIT/DSD/SDB Manager

Purpose: This OIT Internal Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines a set of minimum documentation and coding standards required for all DSD developed SQL source code. Scope: All SQL source code developed and/or modified by DSD from the effective date forward, regardless of DBMS (data base management system) is required to undergo and pass a review prior to deployment to the production environment. Code review is necessary in order to ensure that DSD's in-house developed code is of high quality, is consistent where necessary, is maintainable, and is optimized for performance. Sources of SQL include: For the purpose of this document, SQL is defined as code containing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements in database objects or contained in application code. Internal database objects and external application sources are identified on the SQL Review Request form. This form is a MS Word template maintained by the Data Design Team and can be found in the OIT\DSD\SDB\DataDesignTeam\Templates folder: ..\..\..\Templates\Word\DDTeam\SQL Review Request.dotx Requirements: SQL coding guidelines have been broken down by documentation, format/naming, and performance. The "Required" column indicates if the specific guideline must be followed in order to pass the review. A "No*" in this column means code violating the guideline will fail code review if it significantly impacts performance, readability, maintenance, or security. Numbers listed in the example column reference SQL coding examples following the guideline summary.

Documentation All SQL source code needs to contain history and SQL statement comments. Comments need to be coded to conform to the programming language restrictions and standard practices.
Item D-1 Documentation Guidelines History comments need to include: a. Date created if new b. Date the change was made c. Developer's name d. Initiative or iET number e. Changes--the description of the change and reason it was required SQL statement comments need to include: a. Description and purpose of the SQL statement b. Code Review Tracking number (projects & initiatives) c. The DAPS number and/or the DAPS name or the word 'NONE' if a DAPS was not provided Each piece of SQL must be uniquely identified.

Format/Naming Presenting the SQL in a consistent format across the application facilitates future maintenance and performance analysis. Programming language restrictions and statement size may limit formatting options. Use available techniques to increase the readability of the statements. SQL that is difficult to read due to poor formatting will fail the review. The following guidelines will improve SQL statements. * Indicates the SQL code may or may not fail depending on the overall ease of readability and maintenance.
Item F-1 Formatting Guidelines Use PREPARED STATEMENTS for dynamic SQL. Input values do not become part of the command with prepared statements, thus eliminating the risk of a SQL injection attack. UNIONs in a SQL statement a. make sure the labels for vertically aligned columns are named the same b. code an AS clause for each column and expression when names are different Example -Required Yes Reason Security

LEFT [OUTER] JOIN h. HAVING s. FULL [OUTER] JOIN i. ORDER BY t. INNER JOIN j. TABLE( SELECT... u. FOR FETCH ONLY k. WITH... v. FETCH FIRST... w. Double space between keywords Exceptions: x. AND when used in a BETWEEN statement does not have to be on a separate line INSERT statements a. Use the column feature for ease of matching columns to their associated values. For easier removals and additions, code each column or expression name b. on a separate line c. vertically aligned d. with the comma preceding the name Indent e. Subqueries f. Case expressions Correlation IDs g. are not required in the INSERT statement itself, but are required in any SELECT statements that supply data. UPDATE statement For easier removals and additions, code each column or expression name in SET clauses a. on a separate line b. vertically aligned c. with the comma preceding the name d. with the associated correlation ID Indent e. Subqueries f. Case expressions Exceptions: g. SQL Server does not permit correlation ID's

Formatting Guidelines SELECT statement For easier removals and additions, code each column or expression name a. on a separate line b. vertically aligned c. with the comma preceding the name d. with the associated correlation ID AS clauses e. must be coded for column expressions and case expressions, so every column has an explicit column label. f. be vertically aligned with each other g. have meaningful names Indent h. Subqueries i. Case expressisons FROM clauses a. Order the table list in a logical order. The main or driving table (the one that returns the fewest rows) should be listed first followed by the supporting tables. b. It is recommended to use explicit joins, thereby keeping join predicates out of the WHERE clause c. sequence tables to use left outer joins instead of right d. code each table on a separate line e. vertically aligned f. with the comma preceding the name For all TABLE EXPRESSIONS g. Use unique names, instead of existing table names or aliases h. Use easily understandable & meaningful names i. AS name must be on a new, separate line j. Indent CORRELATION ID k. Define a unique ID for each table referenced in queries (SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE). This includes newly created UNION statements. The preference is to use the predefined table alias if one has been established (listed in the Catalog Query System) l. If aliases have not been defined, assign a unique, meaningful correlation ID for each table m. Provide a suffix for the correlation id when the same table is used more than once n. Includes SELECT statements providing data to an INSERT Exceptions: o. SQL Server does not permit correlation ID's in Update & Delete queries p. SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1 and DUAL tables do not require correlation IDs q. PARS tables use 3 or 4 character aliases r. Existing UNION's must have unique correlation ID's within each segment.

Performance Each SQL statement executed by the DBMS must be checked for performance and maintainability. Additionally, code will be compared to the SQL specification. * Indicates the SQL code may or may not fail depending on the performance impact
Item P-1 Performance Guidelines SELECT a. only the columns needed by the program. Select * incurs too much overhead. b. each needed column by column name c. only the number of rows needed Avoid locks by setting the lowest usable transaction isolation level on read-only SELECT and SELECT INTO statements d. In DB2 add WITH UR to prevent locking e. In SQL Server use ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED f. Use COALESCE with column aggregate functions (SUM, MIN, MAX, etc.) in the result set to account for possible null column values. This reduces the code to maintain by eliminating the need for null indicator variables. Example 3 All 5 Required Yes Yes Yes Reason

Performance Guidelines WHERE a. Use the IN clause instead of ORs for checking local predicates for a list of values Avoid using column functions b. arithmetic (min, max, count, etc.) c. concatenation d. dates (year, month, day, etc.) e. etc.... EXISTENCE CHECKING f. Use WHERE EXISTS instead of SELECT COUNT(*) because processing stops when a row meeting the condition is found. g. Use WHERE EXISTS, JOIN, or a correlated subquery instead of a subquery with the IN operator Use VIEWS only a. for security reasons b. when required by third party products. Table expressions promote better performance and easier code maintenance. UNION a. Use UNION ALL rather than UNION, when eliminating duplicate rows is not necessary. b. If each SQL in the union references the same tables try to use a CASE expression Take advantage of the power of the DBMS to join tables rather than doing it in the application code. ORDER BY a. Avoid unless order is required for the result set Use literal values in the SQL for constants to provide the DBMS more specific information for query optimizations. Use host variables that match the data type, length and scale of the column being compared.

BUREAU OF THE PUBLIC DEBT IT STANDARD 6. Software Engineering 6.1. Applications 6.1.7 COBOL Programming Date Issued: July 14, 1989 Date Last Reviewed: January 2011 Date Next Review: January 2012 Formerly IT Standard 3.3.1 - COBOL Programming Approver: OIT/DSD/EDB Branch Manager

Reference: IT Standard 3.3.17, Mainframe Operating System Related Names

Purpose: This IT Standard provides minimum guidance on the coding standards of all COmmon Business Oriented Language (COBOL) programs developed and maintained within the Division of Systems Development. Scope: This IT Standard applies to all COBOL programs, whether they are developed by inhouse or by contractor personnel. Background: The benefit in establishing these programming standards will be program code that is more easily readable, uniform, and is consistent in structure from program to program. This in turn will ease the burden of program maintenance by making program code easier and quicker to understand. Requirements: The following COBOL Programming Standards are mandated. COBOL Programming Standards These programming standards are presented in a structure that coincides with the divisions of a COBOL program (i.e., Identification Division, Environment Division, Data Division and Procedure Division), and is presented in this manner to facilitate understanding and referencing of the following material. The specific portions of these programming standards as they relate to each of the four divisions are described below. 1. Identification Division. This division is the first part of a COBOL source program. It is used to label, identify, and describe the specific program, allowing the programmer to note pertinent descriptive information concerning the program. The data entered in this division becomes a part of the program listing, but has no effect on the object program. It is, however, required for syntax in compilation though it is not used during program execution.

1

The Identification Division is not divided into sections. Instead, it should consist of the following statements listed below: a. Program Identification. This paragraph will be coded as follows: Program-ID. XXXXXXXX. This entry is to be coded using published standard 3.1.1 Basic Naming Techniques. b. Date-Written. This date should reflect the original implementation of the program and should not be modified. Date-Written. month-year. c. Date-Compiled. This paragraph identifies the entry that must be left blank. The computer will list the actual compile date in month and year format. Date-Compiled. month-year. If this statement is not present in the program, the programmer should include it. d. Author. This paragraph identifies the original author of the program which should not be changed. Author. (name). e. *Remarks. A Remarks paragraph briefly describing the purpose(s) and function(s) of the program should be included in every program. This statement, which begins with an asterisk in column 7, should be placed after the Author statement. Additionally, each time a program is modified the programmer will include the following information in the Remarks area: Date (mm/dd/yy), Programmer Name, iET Enterprise and/or IT Governance number, and a short narrative description of the change being made. 2. Environment Division. The Environment Division is composed of two sections: (1) Configuration Section and (2) Input-Output Section. The Configuration Section is an optional section that indicates: (1) the Source-Computer that will be used for compiling the program and (2) the Object-Computer that will be used for executing the program. The Input-Output Section follows the Configuration Section and supplies information concerning the files used in the program. The primary functions of this division are to define and specify the machine configuration used by the individual program and to establish linkage between equipment and program.

2

The following conventions are to be followed in the preparation of this division. Environment Division. Configuration Section. Source-Computer. IBM-370. Object-Computer. IBM-370. Input-Output Section. This section may be omitted if there are no input or output files. File-Control. The following rules must be observed:    A separate line must be used for each clause. Select. Each 'File Name' in a select clause must be descriptive and meaningful. Assign. In OS/VS COBOL, the device type is determined in the JCL. COBOL Program: JCL: Select In-File Assign to RLMASTER //RLMASTER DD etc.

In our environment, the variable following the `Assign' clause is a descriptive name of the files used by the program. The variable name itself follows BPD IT Standard 3.3.17, Mainframe Operating System Related Names, Item # 6, Report ID, and/or Item # 7, Data Definition Names.   The RESERVE NO ALTERNATE AREA(S) clause must not be used. The TRACK-AREA clause must not be used.

3. Data Division. The Data Division is that part of a COBOL program that defines and describes data fields in storage. It is subdivided into three parts:    File Section, Working-Storage Section, and Linkage Section.

Each section consists of entries, rather than sentences, and must contain a level indicator and a data or file name, and may include one or more clauses.

3

The Data Division's general coding standards are listed below:        Level numbers subordinate to 01s should be multiples of five, e.g., 05, 10, 15, etc., to permit future insertion of group items. The abbreviations PIC, COMP-3, COMP, and SYNC may be used. Meaningful Data Names must be used. Redefines items must be the same length as the original entry. Sending and receiving fields must have the same usage, length, and number of decimal places whenever possible. Fields must be defined in such a way as to reduce the incidence of mixedmode arithmetic, mixed-mode comparisons, and mixed-mode moves. Receiving fields (multiplier) in multiply statements must be defined large enough to hold the product. File Section Conventions (1) Each FD should contain recording mode, label records, data records, and RECORD CONTAINS. BLOCK CONTAINS 0 RECORDS must be used.

a.

(2) b.

Working-Storage Conventions The Working-Storage Section, which must follow the File Section, contains all fields necessary for the processing of data that are not included in the input or output files contained in the FDs of the File Section. Constant terms may be set up as the first and last statement of the Working-Storage Section, and may be interspersed throughout the section. This will provide a simple method of locating the Working- Storage Section in core dumps. Comments can be effectively used in the Working-Storage Section to increase readability and clarity. Comments should be included with any changes made to hard-coded items, such as, but not limited to, flags and switches.

4

The Working-Storage Section's general coding standards are listed below: The use of 77 level items should be avoided. For program consistency use the following sequence within working storage: switches control fields/hold areas counters/subscripts/indexes subtotal/total fields tables print fields record descriptions

Fields to be computed should be defined as COMP or COMP-3. (COMP is faster, and COMP-3 must be used for larger items, report items, and for reviewing dumps and displays.) Utilize 88-levels for testing a range of values instead of multiple IF statements whenever possible. Literals must agree with pictures in size and sign. Always initialize numeric fields, if signed numeric, always initialize with a signed value. Use one- byte switches (i.e., 'Y' or 'N'). It is not necessary to use 'yes' or 'no'. Avoid the continuance of literals over more than one source line by sub-dividing. Numeric data fields not requiring editing or computations may be defined as alpha-numeric or redefined as alpha-numeric. Nonnumeric literals cannot exceed 120 characters. All numeric data fields defined as COMP-3 should have an odd number of digits, if possible. All numeric data items used as subscripts should be defined as binary (COMP). Make an attempt to coordinate the lengths of data elements involved in move statements.

5

Use prefixes for ease of identification, such as: 01 WS-SW-001 (Working Storage Switch 1). Level numbers subordinate to 01s should be multiples of five, e.g., 05, 10, 15, etc., to permit future insertion of group items. Parameters that are being passed with USING should be grouped under a single group level item, if possible. Values may be defined in Working-Storage so that the use of literals in the Procedure Division is minimized. Exceptions to this would include numeric literals that increment/decrement counters, subscripts and indexes, and literals used in set, search, or perform. Words and numeric literals must not be split between lines. Clauses must not be continued to subsequent lines when it can be avoided. c. Linkage Section. The Linkage Section describes data made available from another program. It is also used to describe data from the PARM field of the EXEC statement, which is made available to a main program at execution time. For more information, refer to the manual, IBM VS COBOL for OS/VS, Subroutine Linkage Feature and MVS/Extended Architecture JCL Reference. Comments can be effectively used in the Linkage Section to increase readability and clarity. Comments should be included with any changes made to hard-coded items, such as, but not limited to, flags and switches. 4. Procedure Division. The Procedure Division consists of a series of steps specifying the action necessary to solve a particular problem. These steps are written in statement form and reflect the logical, computational, and input/output requirements of the program. Comments in the Procedure Division are used to increase the maintainability of the program and to explain complicated or intricate logic. Programmers may include comments at the beginning of appropriate paragraphs and/or sections. When programmers are modifying programs, comments should be included to explain changes made. Comments are particularly necessary when major logic changes are made to a program. Additionally, since comments have not been extensively used in programs over the years, programmers should include comments in paragraphs or sections of code that they have reviewed and analyzed to clarify logic and program flow even if that area is not being modified. This will assist subsequent efforts to modify or debug code.

6

See Attachment A for examples of the source code documentation outlined in this IT Standard. The Procedure Division's general coding standards are listed below: (1) (2) No more than one statement shall be coded on a single source line. Indentation of clauses and statements shall be employed to make clear the intent of various procedures. Stop run must be coded only once within the program. All paragraphs must be numbered sequentially for ease of readability and cross-reference. Paragraph names must appear on a line by themselves starting in column 8. Make an attempt to code paragraphs to perform a single function and be as brief as possible. Normally, use only one 'Open' and 'Close' and one name for each input or output file. Also, use only one 'Read' or 'Write' for each input or output file. Use blank lines or ejects between paragraphs for easier readability. Close files as soon as possible after the end of input or output processing in order to free up memory resources. Keep logic of programs simple to avoid confusion. If a slash / is used in the PARM field, it may cause an invalid PARM length to be calculated by the compiler. If you wish to use separation characters, such as in a date, use a dash - in place of a slash (e.g., PARM='MM-DD-YY'). a. Conditions (1) Through definition of data in Working-Storage, non-numeric (logical) comparisons must be employed for all tests not related to computations. (2) Control page overflow on print data sets by counting the lines as they are printed.

(3) (4)

(5)

(6)

(7) (8)

(9) (10)

(3) Do not use the 'Then' command in 'If' statements. (4) Attempt to match each 'If' with an 'Else' statement. (5) Do not fall through or continue through a set of compares that are not necessary, as in a series of 'If' statements. Do not recheck a field once it has already been tested. (6) Always test for numeric data prior to performing arithmetic functions. (7) Tests for a set of conditions should be arranged such that the frequently used conditions are tested first. (8) When nested 'IF' statements are used in programs, they must be indented properly. In other words, 'IF' and 'ELSE' statements must be aligned. b. Branching (1) Return-Code must be used to pass a return code to the operating system or to the invoking program when executing GoBack. Successful completion must be indicated by 0 (Zero). Other values must be in multiples of 4 with maximum of 4095, if not in conflict with the utility being used. (2) When calling a sub-program from a main program, GoBack must be used to terminate all programs. Do not use Exit Program, Stop Run, or Stop 'Literal'. (3) When multiple branches are being established, the most likely branches must be tested first. c. Arithmetic (1) Compute must be used for efficiency provided the statement is comparatively easy to understand. (2) Literals for arithmetic manipulation must be signed if the field to be manipulated is signed. d. Verbs (1) Add corresponding is not to be used.

8

(2) Alter statements are not to be used. (3) Move corresponding is not to be used. (4) Subtract corresponding is not to be used. (5) Numeric items used in a 'Move' or computation statement should have the same length and decimal point alignment if possible. (6) Use 'On Size Error' if division by zero is possible. (7) The 'Giving' option is always to be used when multiplying. (8) All 'Perform' statements must perform 'Thru' an 'Exit' paragraph. e. Tables (1) For processing small serial tables, the order of the Table must be the order of use with the most frequently used items at the beginning. (2) For large sequential tables, it is recommended that either segmented search or the binary search be utilized. (3) Internal tables must not be used if they are subject to change. They must be placed on master tables.

BUREAU OF THE PUBLIC DEBT OIT STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) 6. Software Engineering 6.1. Applications 6.1.1. Application Build, Hosted 6.1.1.244 Downloads and Approvals Date Issued: February 19, 2010 Date Last Reviewed: May 2010 Date Next Review: May 2011 Approver: OIT/DSD/SDB Branch Manager

References:

Purpose: This OIT Internal Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents the multi-step process used to obtain, evaluate, and request approval to implement commercial or open source/freeware software components, herein called components, within Software Engineering (application development) projects and processes. Scope: This SOP is applicable to elements where Software Engineering provides primary responsibility. Background: The Bureau's "IT Rules of Behavior" and Baseline Security Requirements place extensive restrictions on the ability to download. However, there are numerous opportunities to utilize stable components without the overhead of designing, developing, or maintaining similar components. With the download restrictions in place, an auditable process is needed to enable the obtaining or updating of components. This process also needs to address potential license restrictions and the maintaining of a component inventory. Requirements: The following image provides an overview of the entire process. Following the image are details of each step.

1

Administration: The Object Librarian Group, herein called Librarian, will maintain the master download request and obtained components along with their associated status, expiration dates, and any resultant artifacts. Cancellation: If the Requestor, Librarian, any Stakeholder, any of the concurrence/approval steps, or the expiration date terminate the evaluation, the following steps will be enacted once the termination request has been verified by the Librarian with the Sponsor.

2

Uninstall and delete: The Librarian will remove the obtained components/artifacts and will coordinate any uninstall service requests with DSD Management and Seat Management. Closure notification: The Object Librarian will send an closure notification e-mail to the all participants once the uninstall and deletes are completed. Workflow: 1. Request 1.1. Developer need The Requestor determines a need based on project scope. If an existing component and/or pattern will not satisfy requirements, a software download request form may be submitted. The Requestor completes the form as thoroughly as possible based on research findings. The form is e-mailed to the Object Librarian Group, using the mailing list OL-SDB-DSD-OIT. 1.2. Review The Librarian, works with the Requestor until the details section of the form is complete. If the details only specify functional requirements, the Librarian works with the Requestor to identify a suitable component. Once a component is identified, the Librarian looks for components that are already in the Reusable Object Library (ROL) to satisfy the requirements. The Librarian also ensures that the component has not been previously disapproved. 1.3. Concurrence If the component is not already in the ROL and the Object Librarian feels requirements and needs are acceptable, the request is routed via e-mail for concurrence from DSD Management. Once a DSD Manager concurs and responds via e-mail to the Librarian that the request is acceptable, they are named the Sponsor of the request; unless they delegate this responsibility. If the request for concurrence remains unanswered for more than three business days, the request is optionally forwarded by the Object Librarian to the DSD Director for consideration. 1.4. Notifications and Approvals 1.4.1. Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) If the request is associated with a procurement action or contract management, the COTR Group is included, using the mailing list AOB (DSM-OIT), as a recipient of the e-mail notification on the intent to download the specified component. This is for contract management purposes.

3

1.4.2. DSD Management DSD Management is included as a CC recipient, using the mailing list DSD Mgmt, of the e-mail notification on the intent to download the specified component. This is for informational purposes. 1.4.3. Legal Counsel If the request is not associated with a procurement action or contract management, Legal Counsel is included, using the addressee David.Copenhaver@bpd.treas.gov, as a recipient of the e-mail requesting approval to download the specified open source. If the request is associated with a procurement action or contract management, Legal Counsel is included, using the same addressee, as a CC recipient of the email notification on the intent to download the specified component. This is for informational purposes and to provide Legal Counsel with knowledge on components placed within the various development and operational domains. 1.4.4. Seat Management Seat Management is included, using the mailing list PC Support, as a CC recipient of the e-mail notification on the intent to download the specified component. Seat Management will use the deployment information to assist with potential support and/or workstation build efforts. 1.4.5. Security Program Staff (SPS) SPS is included, using the mailing list SPS (OAC-OIT), as a recipient of the email notification on the intent to download the specified component. SPS will respond indicating a SPS Liaison for this request. Additionally they will identify the need for Security Services Branch (SSB) testing during the evaluation period, specify additional security related artifacts that are required, cancel the request, or indicate that SPS has no interest in this request. 1.4.6. Sponsor The Sponsor is included as a CC recipient of the e-mail notification on the intent to download the specified component. This is for informational and planning purposes. 2. Download The SPS Liaison responds to the e-mail notification request by providing their requirements. If applicable, Legal Counsel responds to the e-mail notification request to provide their approval or disapproval of the request.

4

Once the approvers provide acceptance notification, the Librarian retrieves the component and any supporting artifacts using a TechLab provided virtual machine. The Librarian ensures an anti-virus scan is successfully completed prior to their placement into the download folder. 3. Evaluation 3.1. Notification The Librarian sends an e-mail notification to all request participants the component/artifacts location, terms of the evaluation period, and if any additional security artifacts will be needed by the end of the evaluation. 3.2. Installation The Sponsor will send an e-mail to the Librarian to provide a list of evaluation personnel permitted to have the component installed. The Librarian will coordinate any installation service requests with DSD Management and Seat Management. The Requestor and any evaluation personnel uses the component in accordance with their job function and applicable governing policies and procedures. 3.3. Tracking The Requestor and evaluation personnel will record any observations during the evaluation period. These notes will be combined into a single document by the Requestor on a monthly basis. Each month's status document will be e-mailed by the Requestor to the Librarian for review. The status will indicate if the component is satisfying the requirements, provide any observations (both positive and negative), and indicate any document/process/pattern changes that are necessary if implemented. If it is the final status document before the status meeting, it will also contain the evaluation teams' recommendation regarding the component. If all goals of the component evaluation have not been completed, the recommendation may be to extend the evaluation period, provided there is sufficient justification. 3.4. SPS Artifacts The Object Librarian will provide oversight on the completion of any artifacts identified by the SPS. These include a Classification and Determination Memo, Security Impact Assessment, and the results of any SSB testing. The artifacts will be completed by the Requestor, and will not be considered complete until the Sponsor and the SPS Liaison provide an acceptance of the applicable artifacts in an e-mail addressed to the Librarian and all other participants. 3.5. Adoption Proposal Prior to the completion of the evaluation period, the Librarian will schedule an Object Librarian status meeting with the Requestor, evaluation personnel, Sponsor, and the
5

Object Librarian to discuss the component evaluation. The outcome of this meeting will determine if the Object Librarian recommends adoption of the component into the ROL, termination of the evaluation, or to request an evaluation period extension. (Note that the period extension may only be requested one time for a given request.) If the outcome of the Object Librarian status meeting is to recommend adoption of the component; the recommendation, final status document, and an outline of any document/process/pattern changes that are required prior to implementation will be send by e-mail by the Librarian to the DSD Leads and DSD Management. The Librarian and the Requestor/Sponsor will request time during a leads segment meeting to discuss the recommendation. If the outcome of the Object Librarian status meeting is to extend the evaluation period, an extension request is e-mailed by the Librarian to DSD Management and all participants for approval by DSD Management. If approved, DSD Management will provide an extension date to all participants. 4. Approval 4.1. Overview If the consensus of the DSD Leads and DSD Management calls for adoption of the component, the Object Librarian will e-mail the recommendation, along with any identified concerns, to the DSD Director for adoption approval. If a consensus cannot be met, any concerns will be e-mailed by the Object Librarian to the Librarian, Requestor and the Sponsor for further discussion. 4.2. Management Approval If the DSD Director is in agreement with the recommendation, an e-mail approval to have the component added to appropriate approved software list will be sent to the Librarian. If the DSD Director is in disagreement, the request will be returned by e-mail to the Librarian, Requestor, and the Sponsor, detailing any concerns that need to be addressed prior to re-submission or provide direction to terminate the request. 4.3. Publish The Librarian will coordinate publishing of this addition to an approved software list, along with any restrictions to its usage, to either the IT Standard 2.2.10 Public Debt Approved IT Products (Desktop Software) or a DSD maintained list depending on the component type. Generally, the IT standard will list components identifiable during workstation audits and the DSD maintained list will contain other components.

6

4.4. Synchronize installation The Librarian will coordinate any required installation or removal service requests with DSD Management and Seat Management. 4.5. Availability The Object Librarian will send an acceptance notification e-mail to the evaluation participants and to the Systems Engineering community.

52.204-9

PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (SEP 2007)

ADDENDUM TO 52.204-9, PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (SEP 2007) PERSONNEL SECURITY AND SUITABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS All contractor and subcontractor personnel who require access to Treasury or Bureau-owned or controlled facilities and security items or products, shall either be United States Citizens or have lawful Permanent Resident Alien (PRA) status. These positions were further designated as "Moderate Risk" and therefore require the contractor or subcontractor personnel to be United States citizens, or lawful PRAs, with at least three (3) or more years of United States residency. Performance of this contract requires contractor and subcontractor personnel to have signed and submitted a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), have an appropriate level background investigation initiated, have a favorable Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) fingerprint check completed, and be issued a Federal Government personnel identification card before being allowed unsupervised physical access to Federal Government facilities and/or logical access to Federal Government Information Technology (IT) Systems and
BPD-BPD-11-CI-0007

6 databases. The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will be the sponsoring official and will coordinate with BPD's Personnel Security to arrange the background investigation and credentialing process. At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor shall identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who shall require physical access to Federal Government facilities and/or logical access to Federal IT systems or databases for the performance of work under this contract. Identified contractor and subcontractor personnel shall complete and return the below listed documents to the COTR. The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place and time specified by the COTR in order to initiate the credentialing process. ˇ ˇ I-9 Form, Documents Utilized in Identity Proofing at http://www.uscis.gov/files/forms/I-9.pdf Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

Background investigations shall be processed in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) standards. To commence the process, each contractor will be required to supply the COTR with their full name, their place of birth (city and state), their date of birth, and their social security number. With this information, Public Debt's Personnel Security staff will initiate the contractor in the Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing System (e-QIP). The Personnel Security Specialist will further provide the contractor online instructions and the website address where you will provide the required information needed to conduct your background investigation. These positions require a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI), which satisfies HSPD-12 background investigation requirements for identified contractor and subcontractor personnel requiring physical access to Federal Government facilities and/or logical access to Federal IT systems or databases. This process provides the government with a means to positively identify and make a suitability determination regarding the applicant under this contract. Upon receipt of a favorable FBI fingerprint check, the contractor's identification card will be issued and/or unsupervised physical access to Government facilities granted. Contractor and subcontractor personnel are required to give, and authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. Government investigative personnel may contact contractor/subcontractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone, or in writing. The contractor shall ensure that all contractor and subcontractor personnel are available for such contact and that timely responses to investigative requests are provided. Alternatively, if it is verified that an individual is already vetted by another agency at the appropriate level of background investigation, and the investigation was completed less than five (5) years prior to the start of the contractor's initial physical/logical access date, then further investigation may not be necessary. If this is applicable, the Contractor shall provide the COTR with the name of the agency that conducted the investigation and completion date, if known. If at any point during this process investigative results are unfavorably adjudicated, the individual will be denied further admittance to work on the contract, including both physical and/or logical access. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this contract, the Government shall have the right of final determination. During performance of the contract, the Contractor shall keep the COTR apprised of any changes in contractor or subcontractor personnel to ensure that work performance is not delayed by compliance with the credentialing process. Identification cards that are lost, damaged or stolen must be reported to the COTR and Issuing Office within eighteen (18) hours. Replacement shall be at the Contractor's expense. If re-issuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COTR. At the end of the contract performance, or when a contractor/subcontractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the contactor shall ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COTR. If the Contractor does not return all identification cards, last payment may be withheld.

BPD-BPD-11-CI-0007

7 This requirement must be incorporated into any subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have regular and routine unsupervised physical access to a federally controlled facility for six (6) months or more, and/or any logical access to a federally controlled information system. Definitions: Physical Access: Is the ability to enter a federally owned facility or federally leased space: - If federal space is limited to a portion of a building then HSPD-12 applies only to that portion owned or leased by the federal government. - Physical access requirements do not apply to: - Contractors (permanent, intermittent, temporary or seasonal), guests researchers, and volunteers needing access for less than six (6) months Logical Access: Ability to access federal IT systems or databases ­ applies to everyone regardless of how long access is required and whether within a federal facility or by remote connectivity. Federal Regulatory Requirements and Industry Standards The Contractor's performance and systems shall comply with the following federal and industry information technology regulatory requirements and standards: Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 73, Guidelines for Security of Computer Applications FIPS 83, Guidelines on User Authentication Techniques for Computer Network Access Control FIPS 140-1 and 140-2, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules FIPS 191, Guideline for the Analysis of Local Area Network Security FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems FIPS 201-1, Personal Identity V5erification for Federal Employees and Contractors National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) SP 800-12, An Introduction to Computer Security - The NIST Handbook NIST SP 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements: A Role and Performance Based Model NIST SP 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems NIST SP 800-28, Guidelines on Active Content and Mobile Code NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems NIST SP 800-31, Intrusion Detection Systems NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology NIST SP 800-37, Guide for Security Certification and Accreditation of Federal Information Systems NIST SP 800-40, Procedures for Handling Security Patches NIST SP 800-41, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy NIST SP 800-42, Guideline for Network Security Testing NIST SP 800-45, Guidelines for Electronic Mail Security NIST SP 800-46, Security for Telecommuting and Broadband Communications NIST SP 800-47, Security Guide for Interconnecting Information Technology Systems NIST SP 800-48, Wireless Network Security NIST SP 800-50, Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program NIST SP 800-52, Guidelines for Selection and Use of Transport Layer Security NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems NIST SP 800-53A, Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems NIST SP 800-58, Security Considerations for Voice Over IP Systems NIST SP 800-60, Guide for Mapping Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories NIST SP 800-61, Computer Security Incident Handling NIST SP 800-68, Guidance for Securing Microsoft Windows XP Systems for IT Professionals: A NIST Security Configuration Checklist NIST SP 800-77, Guide to IPSec VPNs NIST SP 800-81, Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide NIST SP 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and Handling NIST SP 800-88, Media Sanitization Guide NIST SP 800-94: Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)

The TCIO M-06-07 expanded OMB M-06-16 by requiring encryption of all mobile media devices with Treasury data. There are approximately 100 additional security control extensions in a variety of areas. 52.209-5 (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
BPD-BPD-11-CI-0007

CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

9 (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JAN 2011)

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-- "Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a
BPD-BPD-11-CI-0007

10 Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. "Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means-- (1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and (2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules). "Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (b) The offeror [_] has [_] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000. (c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information: (1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: (i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction. (ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. (iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-- (A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or (B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. (iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. (d) The offeror shall post the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). 52.209-9 UPDATES OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JAN 2011) (a) The Contractor shall update the information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) on a semi-annual basis, throughout the life of the contract, by posting the required information in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov. (b)(1) The Contractor will receive notification when the Government posts new information to the Contractor's record. (2) The Contractor will have an opportunity to post comments regarding information that has been posted by the Government. The comments will be retained as long as the associated information is retained, i.e., for a total period of 6 years. Contractor comments will remain a part of the record unless the Contractor revises them. (3)(i) Public requests for system information posted prior to April 15, 2011, will be handled under Freedom of Information Act procedures, including, where appropriate, procedures promulgated under E.O. 12600. (ii) As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in FAPIIS on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews, will be publicly available. 52.216-18 ORDERING (OCT 1995) (a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2021. (b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control.

BPD-BPD-11-CI-0007

11 (c) If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered "issued" when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule. 52.216-19 ORDER LIMITATIONS (OCT 1995) (a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than _____________ , the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract. (b) Maximum order. The Contractor is not obligated to honor-- (1) Any order for a single item in excess of _____________; (2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of ______________; or (3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within _____________ days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. (c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within _____ days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor's intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or services from another source. 52.216-22 INDEFINITE QUANTITY (OCT 1995) (a) This is an indefinite-quantity contract for the supplies or services specified, and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule. The quantities of supplies and services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract. (b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. The Contractor shall furnish to the Government, when and if ordered, the supplies or services specified in the Schedule up to and including the quantity designated in the Schedule as the "maximum." The Government shall order at least the quantity of supplies or services designated in the Schedule as the "minimum." (c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations. (d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after September 30, 2021. 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICE (NOV 1999)

The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days before the contract expiration date. 52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)

(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within the final 30 days of each contract period; provided, that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires.

BPD-BPD-11-CI-0007

12 (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 10 years. 52.222-46 EVALUATION OF COMPENSATION FOR PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES (FEB 1993) a) Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance. It is therefore in the Government's best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly compensated. As part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted high-quality work. The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees. Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement. c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories, since it may impair the Contractor's ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements. d) Failure to comply with these provisions may constitute sufficient cause to justify rejection of a proposal. 52.227-19 COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE LICENSE (DEC 2007) (a) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions contained in the Contractor's standard commercial license or lease agreement, the Contractor agrees that the Government will have the rights that are set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause to use, duplicate or disclose any commercial computer software delivered under this contract.

18 PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (IAS) ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCE CENTER, BUREAU OF THE PUBLIC DEBT 1.0. BACKGROUND

The Office of Public Debt Accounting (OPDA) manages the Government Agency Investment Services (GAIS) program and the Summary Debt Accounting (SDA) program. The GAIS line of business consists of the Federal Investments Program, the Special Investments Program, and the Federal Borrowings Program. These programs account for Government Account Series (GAS) Securities, Hope Bonds, State and Local Government Series (SLGS) Securities, other Special Purpose Securities (such as Rural Electrification, Tax and Loss, and FHA Debentures), and Treasury loans to federal agencies. The SDA Program's objective is to accurately account for and report on the outstanding public debt and interest expense related to GAIS and marketable Treasury securities. OPDA provides accounting controls for funds received and disbursed from the issuance, redemption, and payment of interest on securities and loans. OPDA maintains the detailed records of the securities (market-based and other special purpose) and loans and reports on the results of the transactions. Market-based securities include Treasury bills, notes, bonds, and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). More descriptive information about Treasury securities and their related interest calculations can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations (Title 31 Money and Finance: Treasury; Chapter II Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury; Part 344 State and Local Government Series See: http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/textidx?c=ecfr;sid=70b038611d77093ddf2f3b0e093ed8b3;rgn=div5;view=text;node=31%3A2.1.1.2.43;idno=31;cc=e cfr and Part 356 Marketable Book-Entry Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds See: http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/textidx?c=ecfr;sid=8c57729c0ee9829f49922fd0d6eee9f6;rgn=div5;view=text;node=31%3A2.1.1.2.52;idno=31;cc=e cfr. The GAIS and SDA programs' generate daily transactions with a volume of approximately 1 million per year. These services are supported by 100 internal, non-technical users and serve approximately 2,500 external users. The software acquisition will provide flexibility for program expansion resulting in an increased volume of transactions and increased user base. The Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) operates a mainframe computer center in Parkersburg, WV, and a network of servers distributed throughout our offices in Parkersburg and Washington, D.C. BPD also operates a contingency site in Kansas City, Missouri. The current system runs under z/OS system software.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
