ATTACHMENT 4: ACCESS HA/TMA NETWORK/DOD IT SYSTEMS

TRICARE Management Activity Office of Administration, Personnel Security Division Instructions for Contractor Access to DoD IT Systems

I.

BACKGROUND

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires contractor personnel designated for assignment to an ADP/IT position to undergo a successful security screening before being granted access to DoD information technology (IT) systems that contain sensitive data. Contractor personnel in positions requiring access to the following must be designated as ADP/IT-I or ADP/IT-II:    Access to a secure DoD Facility Access to a DoD Information System (IS) or a DoD Common Access Card (CAC)-enabled network Access to DEERS or the B2B Gateway.

Effective October 1, 2009, DoD transitioned to the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) for the processing of investigative Standard Forms (SFs) to include SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions), SF-85P (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions), and SF-86 (Questionnaire for National Security Positions). e-QIP is a webbased automated system managed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which facilitates the processing of SFs for background investigations. Most companies having TRICARE contracts have positions of Public Trust and require the submission of the SF-85P. These companies will be phased-in to e-QIP by the TMA, Office of Administration, Personnel Security Division (TMA PSD). The TMA PSD shall provide each Facility Security Officer (FSO) the training necessary to access and use e-QIP. As previously noted, contractor personnel are required to have a favorably completed background investigation in accordance with their position designations. However, the TMA PSD may approve an interim DoD CAC to contractor personnel for access to DoD IT systems. Approval for an interim DoD CAC is based on a favorable advance National Agency Check (NAC), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check, and an initiated background investigation through e-QIP with OPM. In order to safeguard against inappropriate use and disclosure of sensitive information, the following references and guidance are used by TMA as source documents:    Privacy Act of 1974 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 DoD 6025.18-R, "DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation, January 2003

      

DoD 5200.2-R, "DoD Personnel Security Program, January 1987 DoD 5400.11-R, "Department of Defense Privacy Program, May 14, 2007) DoDI 8500.1, "Information Assurance (IA)", October 24, 2002 Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors, August 27, 2004 Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 201 (FIPS 201-1), Personal Identify Verfication (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors, March 2006 Directive Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006, DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive -12 (HSPD-12), November 26, 2008 Request for Waiver to Grant Interim Access to DoD Information Systems for TRICARE Contractor Employees, May 14, 2009

The requirements above must be met by contractors and subcontractors who have access to DoD IS containing information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA. II. PURPOSE

The purpose of this instruction is to define the Contractor's responsibilities when contractor personnel require access to DoD IT systems. III. SCOPE OF WORK

A. Contract/Order. Upon notification that a contract/order has been awarded, the Contractor awarded the contract/order shall: (1) Contact the TMA PSD and provide its company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and the name of its designated official or Facility Security Officer (FSO). (2) Provide its contract number, delivery order number, and contract beginning and ending dates. B. ADP/IT Position Sensitivity Designations. The Prime Contractor shall ensure all contractor personnel, including any subcontractor personnel, are designated as ADP/IT-I or ADP/IT-II when their duties meet the criteria of the position sensitivity designations. The Contractor FSO shall use the guidance below to determine a contractor employee's specific ADP/IT level. (1) ADP/IT-I ­ Those positions which have major responsibility for the planning, direction, design, testing, maintenance, operation, monitoring, and/or management of systems hardware and software; or responsibility for the preparation or approval of data for input into a system with relatively high risk for effecting severe damage to persons, properties or systems, or realizing significant personal gain.

A Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) is the type of investigation used for ADP/IT-I Trustworthiness Determinations. The scope of the SSBI is 10 years and includes:        Personal Subject Interview (conducted by an OPM Investigator) Standard National Agency Check (NAC)* Employment, education, residence, and reference checks Law enforcement and court record checks Check of citizenship and family's legal status (if foreign born) Check of spouse or cohabitants, and former spouse (if applicable) Credit check

(2) ADP/IT-II ­ Those positions which have the responsibility for systems' design, operation, testing, maintenance, and/or monitoring, but are carried out under the technical review of an ADP/IT-I. Responsibilities include but are not limited to access to and / or processing of proprietary data requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 or Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts. A National Agency Check with Local Law and Credit (NACLC) is the type of investigation used for ADP/IT-II Trustworthiness Determinations. The scope of the NACLC is 7 years and includes the following:     Standard NAC* Employment, education, residence, and reference checks Law enforcement check Credit check

*Standard NAC includes: SII, DCII, FBI name check, and FBI National Crime History fingerprint check Within 5-business days of notification of a contract award, the Contractor FSO shall notify and provide the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with a list of contractor employees who require access to DoD IT systems. For each contractor employee, the list shall include the individual's name, social security number, date of birth, and the ADP/IT level. C. Employee Prescreening. The Contractor shall conduct thorough reviews of information submitted on an individual's application for employment in a position that requires an ADP/IT background investigation or involves access via a contractor system to data protected by either the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, or the HHS HIPAA Privacy and Security Final Rule. This prescreening shall include reviews that:

   

Verify United States citizenship Verify education (degrees and certifications) required for the position in question Screen for negative criminal history at all levels (federal, state, and local) Screen for egregious financial history; for example, where adverse actions by creditors over time indicate a pattern of financial irresponsibility or where the applicant has taken on excessive debt or is involved in multiple disputes with creditors

The prescreening may be conducted as part of the pre-employment screening, but must be completed before the assignment of any personnel to a position requiring the aforementioned ADP/IT accesses. The pre-screening can be performed by the contractor's personnel security specialist, human resource manager, hiring manager or similar individual. D. Background Investigation Requirements. Effective October 1, 2009, all requests for background investigations shall be submitted to OPM electronically in e-QIP. An interim DoD CAC can be given by the TMA PSD for access to DoD IT systems upon confirmation of a based on a favorable advance NAC, FBI fingerprint check, and an initiated background investigation in e-QIP.

COST WORKSHEET OVERVIEW
The purpose of this cost worksheet is to provide prospective contractors with a standardized means for submitting cost proposals. The following tabs are arranged to allow contractors to propose bids for the base contract year as well as each of the option years. Each worksheet contains a listing of the CLINs that apply to each of the corresponding contract years as well as footnotes describing the performance criteria for each CLIN. 
It is in the best interest of the government for this contract to be priced using a hybrid-costing model. The following factors apply to this cost model:
CLINs 0002, 1001, 2001, 3001 & 4001.  These CLINs represent the costs associated with providing Per-Member Per-Month (PMPM) coverage for all MTF-enrolled TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Plus beneficiaries. 
- Each of these CLINs represents the PMPM coverage for the contract year. Prospective contractors should base their respective bids on annual estimated beneficiary enrollments and annual utilization estimates, as listed in Exhibit 4.                                                    
EXAMPLE  
Contract Year        Utilization Estimates     Enrollment Estimates   PMPM Rate        Monthly Cost          Annual Cost
Base Year                        375,000                          2,866,761                $0.10             $286,676.10            $3,440,113
Option Year 1                  600,000                          2,872,495                $0.15             $430,874.25            $4,846,491
Option Year 2                  700,000                          2,878,240                $0.20             $575,648.00            $6,907,776
Option Year 3                  800,000                          2,883,996                $0.25             $720,999.00            $8,651,988        
Option Year 4                  900,000                          2,889,764                $0.30             $866,929.00          $10,403,150
(Note: The PMPM rates used for this example are for illustrative purposes only. These should not be considered rates proposed by the government.)              
CLINs 0003, 1002, 2002, 3002 & 4002.  These CLINs represent the costs associated with providing cost-per-call coverage for all MCSC-enrolled TRICARE Prime enrollees.  
- Each of these CLINs represents the annual minimum calls that the government will be obligated to pay the contract awardee (Base Year: 150,000 calls; Each Option Year: 200,000 calls).  
- Prospective bidders should base their quoted rate for each contract year based on per-call rate coverage multiplied by the number of annual minimum calls. Example – $12/call X 200,000 calls = $2,400,000. (Note: The per-call rate used for this example is an arbitrary number that should not be considered rates proposed by the government.)
- If the volume of calls for a contract year is less than the annual minimum, the government will still be responsible for paying the base rate. 
- If the total volume of calls exceed the annual minimum, the government will leverage Optional CLINs 0007,0008, 0009,0010,1006,1007,1008, 1009,2006,2007,2008,2009, 3006,3007,3008,3009, 4007,4008, 4009 & 4010.  to purchase the remaining volume of calls. 
- For example: if during Option Year 2, the annual minimum number of calls is reached by the end of the ninth month, the government will estimate the coverage needs to meet the estimated number of calls based on recent call volumes. If in this case the government estimated that another 60,000 calls would be required, then the government would use Optional CLIN 2008. If the actual number of calls is only 57,000, the government will still pay for 60,000 calls.
CLINs 0004, 1003, 2003, 3003 & 4003.  These CLINs represent the costs associated with providing cost-per-call coverage for all other TRICARE enrollees (Standard, Extra, TRICARE for Life, etc).  
- Each of these CLINs represents the annual minimum calls that the government will be obligated to pay the contract awardee (Base Year: 412,500 calls; Each Option Year: 550,000 calls).  
- Prospective bidders should base their quoted rate for each contract year based on per-call rate coverage multiplied by the number of annual minimum calls. Example – $10/call X 550,000 calls = $5,500,000. (Note: The per-call rate used for this example is for illustrative purposes only. This should not be considered a rate proposed by the government.)
- If the volume of calls for a contract year is less than the annual minimum, the government will still be responsible for paying the base rate. 
- If the total volume of calls exceed the annual minimum, the government will leverage 0011,0012,0013, 0014, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 2010, 2011, 2012,2013,3010, 3011, 3012,3013, 4011, 4012, 4013,& 4014 to purchase the remaining volume of calls. 
- For example: if during Option Year 4, the annual minimum number of calls is reached by the end of the seventh month, the government will estimate the coverage needs to meet the estimated number of calls based on recent call volumes. If in this case the government estimated that another 400,000 calls would be required, then the government would use CLINs 4011, 4013 and 4014. If the actual number of calls is only 390,000, the government will still pay for 400,000 calls.
Optional CLINs 0007,0008,0009,0010,1006,1007,1008, 1009,2006,2007,2008,2009, 3006,3007,3008,3009, 4007,4008, 4009 & 4010. 
- Each of these Optional CLINs allow for the government to purchase additional cost-per-call coverage for MCSC-enrolled TRICARE Prime beneficiaries. 
- Prospective bidders should base their quoted rate for the additional coverage for each Optional CLIN based on the cost-per-call coverage.  
- Example – If the government estimated that it needed cost-per-call coverage for an additional 40,000 calls, the contractor would need to quote the cost-per-call rate for a lot of 40,000 calls. If this occurred in Option year two, the government would use CLIN 2007. The contractor would give their quote based on the cost-per-call multiplied by 40,000 calls ($12/call X 40,000 calls = $480,000). (Note: The per-call rate used for this example is for illustrative purposes only. This should not be considered a rate proposed by the government.)
- If the volume of calls used is less than the volume of calls purchased, the government will still be responsible for paying for the entire amount specified by the CLIN. 
Optional CLINs 0011,0012,0013, 0014, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 2010, 2011, 2012,2013,3010, 3011, 3012,3013, 4011, 4012, 4013,& 4014. 
- Each of these Optional CLINs allow for the government to purchase additional cost-per-call coverage for all other TRICARE beneficiaries (Standard, Extra, TRICARE for Life, etc).  
- Prospective bidders should base their quoted rate for the additional coverage for each Optional CLIN based on the cost-per-call coverage.  
- Example – If the government estimated that it needed cost-per-call coverage for an additional 100,000 calls, the contractor would need to quote the cost-per-call rate for a lot of 100,000 calls. If this occurred in Option year three, the government would use CLIN 3013. The contractor would give their quote based on the cost-per-call multiplied by 100,000 calls ($10/call X 100,000 calls = $1,000,000). (Note: The per-call rate used for this example is for illustrative purposes only. This should not be considered a rate proposed by the government.)
- If the volume of calls used is less than the volume of calls purchased, the government will still be responsible for paying for the entire amount specified by the CLIN.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT Date: 11 September 2012

Title: CONUS NURSE ADVICE LINE (NAL) Requiring Activity Name: TRICARE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY (OCMO)

1.0

SCOPE

This requirement provides for consultative, analytical, decision making, managerial, and implementation support services to TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), a component of the Military Health System (MHS), for a Nurse Advice Line (NAL), offering 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year telehealth nurse triage and self/ home care advice, civilian network authorizations, civilian network provider locator support, and specified Military Treatment Facility (MTF) appointing services, for the MHS. The intent is to utilize personnel with telehealth experience to implement, support, and maintain a NAL for beneficiaries of the TRICARE health care program serving Uniformed service members, retirees, and their families (henceforth referred to as TRICARE) residing or visiting in the Continental United States (CONUS). The contractor shall maintain the necessary personnel to provide the types and kinds of capabilities set forth in this Performance Work Statement. The CONUS NAL will be an enterprise driven program that employs a common CONUS wide approach to providing professional telehealth nurse triage to TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Plus, TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. The CONUS NAL will employ customer service representatives, authorization and appointing clerks, and telehealth experienced RNs to support the CONUS NAL's purpose of providing all TRICARE beneficiaries clinical advice and urgent care support based on nationally recognized certifications, protocols and

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 32 of 105

guidelines. A contractor supplied physician will be on-call at all times to provide the telehealth RNs support as required. For MTF-based TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Plus enrollees, the CONUS NAL will also provide MTF acute/ OPAC care appointing services to those MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries through the MHS' Composite Health Care System (CHCS). MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries will also be offered the option to cancel and/or reschedule primary care appointments through the NAL. For US Coast Guard clinic-based TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Plus enrollees, similar functions will be performed utilizing the EPIC electronic health record. The NAL contractor will be responsible for supporting real-time (RT) information sharing with their personnel that supports the NAL functions as well as near-real-time (NRT) information sharing with all Prime (civilian and MTF enrolled) and Plus (MTF only) beneficiaries' Primary Care Managers (PCMs); as well as reporting to the CONUS NAL Program Management Office. CONUS NAL reporting is expected to support the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) initiative, provide insight into MHS access issues, CONUS NAL utilization, and possible endemic health issues. Lastly, in accordance with Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) guidelines, the CONUS NAL will achieve and maintain a high level of beneficiary satisfaction. The CONUS NAL will be overseen initially by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). It is anticipated that the CONUS NAL Program Management Office, chaired by the Office of the Chief Medical Officer (OCMO), will be operational at the onset of the contract. Once operational, the NAL PMO will provide oversight of the contract. The NAL PMO will be comprised of TMA staff. The NAL Program Management Office will manage the CONUS NAL implementation according to the approved processes after contract award. It will provide oversight post-implementation to confirm vendor compliance with contract, monitor reporting, escalate issues to MHS leadership, and work with the vendor towards required issue resolution. 1.0.1 Background

The MHS maintains an agile, fully deployable medical force and health care delivery system that provides state-of-the-art health services for 9.6 million Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries. TRICARE is the health care program serving; Active Duty Service Members (ADSM), Active Duty Family Members (ADFMs), National Guard and Reserve members, retirees and their families, survivors and certain former spouses worldwide The mission of the TRICARE health program is to enhance the Department of Defense and our nation's security by providing health support for the full range of military operations and sustaining the health of all those entrusted to our care. As a major component of the MHS, TRICARE brings together the health care resources of the uniformed services (via the Service's MTFs) and supplements them with networks of civilian health care professionals, institutions, pharmacies and suppliers (via the TRICARE regional MCSCs to provide access to high-quality health care services, while maintaining the capability to support military operations.

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 33 of 105

TRICARE beneficiaries are a highly mobile group. ADSMs and ADFMs often move every 1-2 years, and comprise approximately 37% of the eligible beneficiary group. The MHS has determined that implementing a NAL will better serve a population that is mobile and often has families that are geographically separated due to mission requirements and deployments. A TMA sponsored NAL will provide beneficiaries a consistent method to access telehealth services, no matter where they are currently located. The decision to implement a NAL is currently driven at the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or regional level. These local or regionally-based NALs serve a small subset of the TRICARE/MHS population and are tailored to specific communities. The CONUS NAL will serve all TRICARE beneficiaries in CONUS (permanently residing or visiting from overseas), to present the beneficiaries with a single access point to TRICARE services no matter where they are located. In addition to telehealth nurse triage services, TMA determined that the CONUS NAL will also provide MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries a venue to cancel primary care appointments at their enrolled MTFs. Based on a successful implementation of this service in the European region, TMA believes that offering appointment cancellation services will reduce MTF no-show rates, and improve access to care for other beneficiaries seeking MTF appointments. Additionally, when any MTF enrolled Prime/Plus beneficiary requests an acute/OPAC appointment after being triaged by a telehealth nurse, the CONUS NAL will support making appropriate primary care provider appointments. For beneficiaries Prime or Plus enrolled to a MTF this means the contractor will support booking acute/OPAC appointments at MTFs. For Prime beneficiaries, the CONUS NAL will also provide authorizations for urgent care and civilian network provider locator assistance to TRICARE non-specialty network providers when appropriate. For TRICARE Prime beneficiaries not enrolled to a MTF, the contractor will provide the beneficiary with information which will allow then to contact providers who are part of the TRICARE network in their location. If the TRICARE Prime beneficiary needs authorization to visit a provider or urgent care facility outside of the MTF or their civilian PCM's office, the NAL contractor will forward the approved authorization to the TRICARE regional MCSC where the urgent encounter will take place as well as the Prime beneficiary's TRICARE regional MCSC of enrollment; and then notify the MTF, Civilian Primary Care Manager, or TRICARE regional MCSC of the authorization event and civilian provider where the beneficiary was directed. This approach to urgent care facility authorizations is consistent with Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 199.17, (n) (2) (i). For non-Prime beneficiaries, the NAL contractor will identify a listing of their region's civilian network providers in their immediate area and their respective contact information so that our non-Prime beneficiaries can call a provider to make an appointment. The MHS utilizes a managed care model for some of the TRICARE health plans. The TRICARE health plans are executed and managed by the TRICARE regional MCSCs. Currently there are three TRICARE regional MCSCs in the Continental United States, Hawaii and Alaska (CONUS) and one Overseas Contractor for Outside of the Continental US, Hawaii, and Alaska

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 34 of 105

(OCONUS). Together these four TRICARE regional MCSCs are the point of contact for TRICARE for the beneficiaries in their region. They are responsible for enrollment, claims, referral management assistance, civilian provider authorizations, civilian claims payments, etc. for all beneficiaries who reside within their respective region. The NAL contract awardee will need to work with the three CONUS TRICARE regional MCSCs through a memorandum of understanding relationship with regards to the approval of civilian urgent care facility authorizations.. The NAL contractor awardee will also need to work with the four MCSCs to ensure that all beneficiary claims associated with civilian encounters resulting from the NAL are processed accordingly. The following is a brief description of each of the applicable TRICARE programs/plans and . eligibility requirements.

Table 1.01-1 TRICARE PLANS AND ELIGIBILITY. This table currently serves to provide a brief description of each of the TRICARE programs/plans and their eligibility requirements. The intent of including this table was to provide potential bidders with some background information on the various TRICARE benefits. To add further clarity for potential bidders, the following paragraph will be added to the PWS, immediately following Table 1.01-1: The information listed in Table 1.01-1 has been included in this performance work statement as a means to provide potential bidders with an overview of the health plans sponsored by TRICARE. Beneficiaries enrolled to each of these plans (except for the US Family Health Plan) that are physically present in CONUS are eligible to use the CONUS NAL. (Beneficiaries enrolled to the US Family Health Plan are not eligible to use the CONUS NAL.) In general, there will be three tiers of support provided by this contract:  MTF-enrolled TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Plus enrollees -The CONUS NAL will provide customer service, telehealth nurse triage, and MTF acute/ Open Access care appointment scheduling and cancellations through the MHS' Composite Health Care System. Urgent care authorizations will also be offered to MTF TRICARE Prime enrollees when MTF based appointments are not available. This coverage applies to all TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Plus enrolled beneficiaries physically located in CONUS. Private Sector Care-enrolled TRICARE Prime enrollees -The CONUS NAL will provide customer service, telehealth nurse triage, and appointing through the regional Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC).

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 40 of 105

This coverage applies to all TRICARE Standard, TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve Select, TRICARE Young Adult-Standard, TRICARE Extra, Continued Health Care Benefit Plan and TRICARE for Life enrolled beneficiaries physically located in CONUS. TMA also sponsors a separate OCONUS NAL that currently provides a similar 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year telehealth nurse triage and medical appointing service for approximately 200,000 beneficiaries in the European region. The CONUS NAL contractor will be expected to share beneficiary encounter information for all OCONUS beneficiaries who utilize the CONUS NAL while physically present in CONUS, with the OCONUS NAL contractor. The CONUS NAL contractor will also be expected to transfer beneficiary calls to the OCONUS NAL for any CONUS-based beneficiary who calls the CONUS NAL while travelling OCONUS. The MHS assumes that beneficiaries enrolled to TRICARE Prime at MTFs and through civilian PCMs will be the main NAL target audience as this population makes up over 50% of the MHS beneficiary base and all urgent healthcare encounters outside their respective PCM's office must be authorized as part of the managed care design to the Prime plan. Estimated quotes for NAL implementation should price all TRICARE Prime beneficiaries at a per member per month rate, with all other TRICARE/MHS beneficiaries priced at a fee for service/usage rate. 1.0.2 Objectives

1. The CONUS NAL will provide TRICARE/MHS beneficiaries toll-free 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year telephone access to telehealth qualified RNs, via 1-800TRICARE (1-800-874-2273). 2. The business processes followed by 1-800-TRICARE, when answering a beneficiary's call, will be the same no matter the beneficiaries' specific TRICARE plan, enrollment status, location of call (within CONUS only), or location of permanent residence (CONUS or OCONUS). The CONUS NAL will operate with the goal of single-call resolution for all beneficiary health advice, appointing and scheduling support. All beneficiary calls shall be serviced immediately with minimal call backs to the beneficiary. 3. All TRICARE beneficiaries located in CONUS (permanent or temporary) will be eligible to utilize the CONUS NAL 4. CONUS NAL telehealth qualified RNs will provide all TRICARE/MHS beneficiaries with clinical advice based on nationally recognized telehealth nursing standards, protocols and guidelines, coupled with the RNs professional experiences and judgment. a.

Push reports with MTF specific information will cover a specified period of time and must be provided by the NAL contractor at least 3 specified times per day to designated MTF representatives. Push reports with aggregate NAL data will also be provided at various dates and specified time intervals other MHS and military service recipients as defined by the NAL PMO. The NAL contractor will ensure that the encounter data provided in each push report is not duplicated from one reporting period to another and is also archived and ad hoc retrievable for a period of time defined by the NAL PMO. 11. The CONUS NAL contractor will achieve and maintain a high level of beneficiary Satisfaction. Beneficiary satisfaction will be measured by TMA through qualitative surveys of patient opinions using quantitative scoring. The NAL Contractor will receive feedback from the NAL PMO on a quarterly basis. 12.The CONUS NAL contractor will have the ability to provide interpreter services for all beneficiaries for customer service, telehealth nurse triage, and medical appointing in multiple languages, including English and Spanish, to support the CONUS NAL service. 13. Well-developed data storage, tracking, and reporting and monitoring mechanisms will provide insight into; MHS access issues, NAL usage, and possible endemic health issues 14.

The DoD's health care system comprised of MTFs that provide care to eligible MHS beneficiaries. Mis-booked appointments occur when (1) a beneficiary is given the wrong appointment type for the level and type of care needed, (2) the appointment clerk does not correctly complete the data elements, (3) the beneficiary is sent to the wrong location or the wrong provider, (4) any other booking error that results in inconvenience to the beneficiary, disruption of clinic effectiveness/efficiency, and failure to appropriately match TRICARE Prime beneficiaries to appointment slots reserved for Prime, or (5) and booking errors that affect the non booked appointment report, i.e. duplicate searches, searches with inappropriate access to care code/search. Feedback regarding mis-booked appointments may be collected from beneficiaries, providers, CHCS reports, clinic support staff, booking clerks and appointment supervisors. In telephony, an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD), also known as Automated Call Distribution, is a device or system that distributes incoming calls to a specific group of terminals that agents use. It is often part of a computer telephony integration (CTI) system. Routing incoming calls is the task of the ACD system. ACD systems are often found in offices that handle large volumes of incoming phone calls from callers who have no need to talk to a specific person but who require assistance from any of multiple persons (e.g., customer service representatives) at the earliest opportunity.

Further, the QASP provides the COR with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance, and provides verifiable input for the required Past Performance Information Assessments. The QASP will be finalized immediately following award and a copy provided to the Contractor after award. The QASP is a living document and may be updated by the Government as necessary. 6.8.2 Performance Requirements Summary Matrix

By monitoring the Contractor, the COR will determine whether the performance levels set forth in the order have been attained. Performance standards are specified in the following Performance Requirements Summary Matrix in the Standard and Acceptable Quality Level columns.

The Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) has been adopted by TMA to electronically capture assessment data and manage the evaluation process. CPARS is used to assesses a contractor's performance and provide a record, both positive and negative, on a given contract during a specific period of time. The CPARS process is designed with a series of checks and balances to facilitate the objective and consistent evaluation of contractor performance. Both government and contractor program management perspectives are captured on the CPAR form and together make a complete CPAR. Once the Assessing Official completes the proposed assessment for the period of performance, the CPARS is released to the appropriate Government Contractor Representative for their review and comments. User ID and Password will be provided to the designated Government Contractor Representative upon issuance of a task order. The contractor has 30 days after the Government's evaluation is completed to comment on the evaluation. The Government Contractor Representative must either concur or nonconcur to each CPAR. If the contractor concurs with the proposed assessment and the Reviewing Official does not wish to see the CPAR, the Assessing Official may close out the CPAR. Otherwise, they must forward the CPAR to the Reviewing Official for them to review, enter comments if appropriate, and close out. The Reviewing Official may at their option direct the Assessing Official to forward every CPAR to them for review. 6.9 Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)/ Information (GFI)/Facilities

The Government will provide the equipment/information/property shown in the attached listing of Government Furnished Equipment/Information/Property in Attachment 2. The Contractor shall maintain a detailed inventory accounting system for Government Furnished Equipment/Material or Contractor-Acquired-Government Owned Property (CAP). The inventory accounting system must specify, as a minimum: product description (make, model), Government tag number, date of receipt, name of recipient, location of receipt, current location, purchase cost (if CAP), and contract/order number under which the equipment is being used. The Contractor shall either: a) attach an update inventory report to each Monthly Progress Report, or b) certify that the inventory has been updated and is available for Government review. In either case the Contractor's inventory listing must be available for Government review within

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

52.212-1

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2012)

L.1 ­ GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 87 of 105

L.1.1. Offerors are cautioned to follow the instructions provided in this section carefully to assure the Government receives consistent information in a format that will facilitate proposal evaluation. Exceptions taken as to inclusion of specific requirements in the resultant contract shall not be considered. Offerors shall submit only one offer. Alternative offers will not be accepted or evaluated by the Government. If an Offeror does submit an alternative offer, neither offer will be accepted by the Government. L.1.2. This section provides general guidance for preparing proposals as well as specific instructions on the format and content of the proposal. The Offeror's proposal must include all data and information requested in this solicitation and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions. The offer shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the solicitation and applicable attachments. Non-conformance with the instructions provided in the solicitation and this section may result in an unfavorable proposal evaluation or rejection of the proposal. The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. L.1.3. The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and contract(s) without discussions. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price as well as a cost and technical standpoint and fails to do so at the offeror's risk. The Government reserves the right to seek information clarifying any element of an offer or other information submitted in the proposal prior to awarding without discussions. This request for information serves to clarify certain aspects of proposals (e.g. the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors. This exchange is not intended to cure weaknesses or material omissions of the offer, or materially alter the technical or cost information in the proposal. The Offeror should not revise their offer in response to clarification questions; any such revision may not be considered. If the Contracting Officer decides that an Offeror's proposal should no longer be considered, the proposal will be excluded from consideration for award; and written notice of this decision will be provided to unsuccessful offerors in accordance with FAR 15.503. If discussions are conducted, the Offerors will be notified as such by the Contracting Officer and discussions scheduled. L.1.4. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather provide rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet or exceed these requirements. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities, capabilities, and experience. The Government will likely base its evaluation on the information presented, plus any additional past performance information obtained by the Government from other sources. L.1.5. Offerors should submit their anticipated organizational structure. The organizational structure must include the prime Contractor and first tier subcontractors. The organizational structure shall include addresses and telephone numbers. In the case of a joint venture or other business structure, a clear description of the organizational relationships must be disclosed.

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 88 of 105

L.1.5.1. In accordance with FAR 9.505, Organization and Consultant Conflicts of Interest, TMA is indicating and advising awareness to all interested offerors that "actual" and "potential" organizational conflicts of interests (OCI) may exist. This is to assist prospective Offerors in developing their own business strategies regarding TMA requirements; and in doing so: avoid, mitigate, and neutralize any "actual" and "potential" OCIs. The following is provided for the purpose of identifying, avoiding, and militating against OCIs of this solicitation/award process. 1) "Potential" or "actual" OCIs may exist with TMA Contractors that currently perform logistical, program, operational, data management support for TMA Aurora CO and TMA Falls Church VA. It is incumbent on all Offerors to use sound business judgment and determine the significance of any conflict of interest. 2) Potential or actual OCIs may exist with former DoD officials/employees that have served in positions such as TRICARE acquisitions, program management, finance, in an executive position or participated in a TRICARE source selection evaluation board as the Source Selection Authority, an advisor or an evaluator. (SEE DFARS 252.203-7000 (Ref 203.171-4)). 3) In the event an Offeror for this procurement intends to use any Contractor employee that currently supports TMA as a subcontractor or in any advisory capacity to this solicitation/contract, or to use a former DoD official/employee when developing a proposal in response to this solicitation, or as a member of the Offeror's organization structure, the Offeror shall provide a mitigation plan to the Government that effectively demonstrates how the Offeror will mitigate any potential or actual OCI in its business arrangement for supporting this contract and any other TMA contract. The mitigation plan shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer with the Offeror's proposal. L.1.6. The remarks, explanations, and answers provided by Government representatives whether orally, or in writing, should not change or qualify any of the terms or conditions of the solicitation. The solicitation can only be changed by a formal written amendment issued by the Contracting Officer. L.1.7. Non-Government Advisors: The expertise of a Non-Government advisor will be required to support evaluation of technical proposals. A USAA Non-Government advisor has been selected to serve in an advisory role on the Source Selection Evaluation Team. This advisor has broad and comprehensive knowledge and will apply expert knowledge of industry practices and standards to assist the Government in evaluation of proposals. Non-Government advisors are subject to the limitations of FAR 7.503 and FAR Part 37.2; and shall not determine ratings or rankings of Offeror's proposals or perform any inherently governmental function. (a) The Release of Proposal Information to Non-Government Advisors: The release of proposal information to non-Government advisors will be subject to the controls of TMA. NonGovernment advisors are not allowed access to past performance information or proprietary financial data (dollar figures) contained in the price/cost proposal; however, to make technical judgments, they are allowed access to man-hours, labor categories, and lists of materials proposed.

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 89 of 105

(b) Prohibitions: Non-Government advisors are prohibited from proposal rating, ranking, or recommending the selection of a source. They are not normally allowed to participate in discussions, but may attend if requested by the chairperson(s). Non-Government advisors are not normally allowed to participate in Government decisionmaking meetings (Source Selection Evaluation Board sessions or Source Selection Authority briefings), unless invited by the chairperson(s) to be present during a particular portion to provide specific technical information. (c) Access to Proprietary Information: Non-Government advisors that have access to proprietary information in performing their roles for the Government must agree to protect the information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. All nonGovernment advisors are required to sign a Non-Disclosure Statement, TMA Form 821. The Contracting Officer shall retain the signed agreements in the contract file. (d) Organizational Conflict Of Interest (OCI): OCI clauses are included in the contracts under which non-Governmental technical advisors are performing services for the Government. The OCI clauses require the companies and individual non-Government advisors to protect Offeror proprietary data and Government source selection information and prohibit the companies from otherwise participating as an offeror, a subcontractor as a consultant to an offeror/subcontractor in relation to this acquisition participation. (e) Permission from Offerors: Upon review of the above limitations, and after the identity of the Non-Government advisor(s) is provided by letter to the offerors, any offeror having concerns/issues regarding these Non-Government advisors having access to its proposal information should notify the Contracting Officer of said objection or obtain a written agreement between the Non-Government advisor and the Offeror in accordance with FAR 9.505-4 (b), and submit to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) working days at time of notification. If no agreement or objection to the proposed non-Government advisors is submitted within the seven (7) working days, the Offeror will be deemed to have consented to the limited access described above. L.1.8. Travel: Estimated to be $10,000 a year. Travel will be required for the base and all option years.

The Government may check the past performance history for these key personnel.

L.3.1 Evaluation Factor 1 - Past Performance and Relevant Experience The Government will consider past performance over the past five (5) years. Relevant past experience is considered to be federal, state, and local government or commercial contracts/work performed or being performed that were/are similar in nature to the current acquisition. The Government may, within its discretion, determine the relevance of an Offeror's previous experience. Similar experience will be evaluated on the basis of the Offeror's breath (experience in multiple disciplines and expertise), depth (number of contracts/projects), level (degree of

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 93 of 105

participation) and relevance of Offeror's experience during the last five (5) years working on projects similar in size, scope and complexity. The information presented in the Offeror's written proposals, together with information from any other sources available to the Government, will provide the primary input for evaluation of this factor. The Government reserves the right to verify the specifics of prior contracts described by Offeror in the proposals. If the Offeror has no single experience that encompasses all types of experience defined under this factor, then the Offeror may show relevant experience through a combination of projects which together show that work has been accomplished which is consistent in scope and complexity. Evaluation of past performance will allow the Government to determine whether the Offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely manner. Past performance information will be obtained (from the Past Performance Questionnaires submitted from the Offerors' customers) for contracts performed by the Offeror during the last five (5) years consistent in scope and complexity with the project. Past performance information will be obtained from references on contracts described in the Offeror's proposal. Past performance on other relevant contracts may also be obtained at the discretion of the Government. In addition to information obtained from references, the Government may use other sources of information to assess past performance, such as Government past performance databases, Inspector General reports, General Accounting Office reports, and information in the media concerning the Offeror. The information obtained from references on contracts described in the Offeror's proposal, together with information from any other sources available to the Government, will provide the primary input for evaluation of this factor. The Government reserves the right to verify the specifics of prior contracts described by the Offeror in its proposal. Additionally, evaluation of past performance may include Offeror's records of providing highquality services in a timely manner; adhering to contract schedules; administrative aspects of contract performance; overall quality, availability, and stability of assigned personnel; reasonable and cooperative behavior; commitment to and business-like concern for the interests of the customer; quality of overall program management; cost savings achieved; record of awards or performance recognition earned, and overall client satisfaction. If an Offeror lacks a record of relevant past performance, it will receive a neutral past performance evaluation. L.3.1.1. References Offerors should provide at least three, primary past performance contract references for the Prime contractor. The Offeror may submit additional references beyond these three primary references. The three primary references must include completed Performance Questionnaires, as directed below. The information shall address any contractual issues that arose and the

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 94 of 105

corrective actions taken. The Government will randomly check the provided past performance history, and may check and consider performance on contracts/tasks not identified by the Contractor. Any offeror without past performance history relevant to this solicitation should submit information relating to key personnel in the firm who have relevant past performance history. Offerors shall specifically identify relevant past performance efforts for each individual cited, the nature of the history and the results of the individuals efforts. Key personnel information shall not exceed 2 pages person. Resumes do not constitute past performance. Offerors with relevant past performance history may, but are not required, to submit key personnel information as stated in the paragraph above. Based on corporate changes in business relationships, it may be necessary for the offeror to submit this information in order to show commitment of resources. L.3.1.2. Questionnaires The Government requires the Offeror to send out Past Performance Questionnaires (RFP Attachment 9 to each of the Points of Contact (POCs) identified in the past performance section.

"Other factors" will include the evaluation factors set forth in Section M of the solicitation. The Government will evaluate each proposal in accordance with its content and past performance to assess Offerors' ability to perform the perspective contract successfully. In this assessment will be evaluated on the factors and sub-factors specified herein. Offerors are advised that the Government reserves the right to make an award on the basis of initial proposals without conducting discussion with Offerors, but may conduct discussions at its discretion. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a technical and pricing standpoint, and fails to at the offeror's risk.

M.2 BASIS OF AWARD

HT0011-12-R-0039 Page 100 of 105

Award will be made to that responsible Offeror whose proposal is determined by the Government to offer the BEST-VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to conduct a tradeoff process to determine which Offeror represents the BEST-VALUE to the Government. A proposal that is "marginal" or "unacceptable" in any single technical factor or sub-factor may be rejected as unacceptable. The Government intends to award a single contract. However, the Government reserves the right to make no award, depending on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic or unreasonable. M.3 EVALUATION FACTORS The following evaluation factors are intended be used: \ Technical Subfactor 1: Nurse Advice Line Services Subfactor 2: Appointment Setting/Cancellation/Rescheduling Services Subfactor 3: Staffing Plan Subfactor 4: Information Technology Systems Management Subfactor 5: Program Management Subfactor 6: Transition Plan Subfactor 7: Quality Management/Improvement Plan Past Performance & Relevant Experience Price M.4 IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS a. Past Performance and relevant experience is intended to be the most important factor. b. Technical Approach Subfactors are equally important. Technical Approach is less important than Past Performance and Relevant Experience. Technical Approach is slightly more important than Price. c. Price is intended as the least important factor, but at the government's discretion price may be deemed more important as the government determines non-price proposals to be essentially equivalent. Indeed, the government may consider price dispositive if it determines, within its discretion, that non-price factors are essentially equal or that particular technical superiority offered isn't worth the additional price. M.5 EVALUATION FACTORS M.5.1 Evaluation Factor 1: Past Performance and Relevant Experience

An offeror's description of its past performance (both the summary information and the specific information for top contracts/agreements), questionnaires completed by the clients, and information developed by the Government, will be used to develop a performance confidence level. M.5.1.2 Providing points of contact that cannot be contacted by the Government may adversely affect the past performance rating. Information utilized may be obtained from the clients listed in the proposal, other customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), and other sources who may have useful and relevant information, including publicly available information. The Government reserves the right to utilize its own internal records.

The recorded message will include "Thank you for calling the Nurse Advice Line. If this is a life threatening emergency, please hang up and call 911. This call may be monitored for quality assurance." This call transfer must be answered in person by the CSR within 20 seconds. 2. CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (CSR)

Page | 1

Customer service representatives (CSR) will serve to acquire and verify with the caller and the official Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS), via General Inquire of DEERS (GIQD) important personal information; such as name, sponsors/individuals social security number and/or DoD Benefit Number, TRICARE enrollment status, if Prime (MTF or civilian enrolled; and then the location (state) where caller is physically located. Once the beneficiary's eligibility (via DEERS data) and core information is obtained as described above, the CSR shall inquire as to the beneficiary's rationale for the call (telehealth nurse advice or triage, or MTF-based primary care ONLY appointment cancellation/rescheduling), and if the request is for telehealth nurse advice/triage, briefly inquire as to the beneficiary's chief complaint (e.g. beneficiary has an illness, ailment, injury, etc). All of this information must be recorded in the NAL contractor's real time (RT) NAL Encounter Information Database to be immediately available to the telehealth nurse and/or the NAL appointment clerks. The CSR will warm-transfer the call either to a telehealth nurse or to the appointment clerk (for preexisting primary care ONLY appointment cancellation/rescheduling). This process must be completed within 3 minutes. Note: NAL callers (eligible MTF Prime/Plus beneficiaries) will not be allowed to schedule a new MTF primary care appointment without first having been triaged by the telehealth nurse. There are no exceptions to this rule. The CSRs will be employed and trained for this position by the NAL contractor. The CSRs will also receive additional training from the TRICARE Management Activity that will focus on the nature of the military health system as well as specific guidelines and standards for treating TRICARE beneficiaries. The intent of this additional training is to provide a more thorough understanding of the population served and their specific needs. 2A. The beneficiary will be warm-transferred by the CSR to the Telehealth Nurse. OR 2B. In cases where telehealth nurse triage is not necessary and the caller (MTF Prime/Plus enrolled only) requests to cancel a previously scheduled primary care ONLY appointment, the beneficiary will be warm-transferred by the CSR to the Appointing Clerk. The Appointing Clerk will receive the beneficiary's background information from the contractor's real time (RT) NAL Encounter Information System and verified by the CSR (if required) before the CSR disengages from the warm-transfer. Then the Appointing Clerk can provide cancellation service for pre-existing MTF primary care ONLY appointments. The Appointing Clerk will also reschedule, at the request of the beneficiary/caller, primary care ONLY appointments of a similar nature and to the same MTF provider as the original appointment. More details about Appointing Clerks are featured in section 5 and in Exhibit 3b 2C. The NAL Appointing Clerk will utilize the contractors RT NAL Encounter Information System to record all discussion and assistance that was given to the beneficiary.

Page | 2

Note: it is critical that all NAL encounter information be held within a RT data repository that is assessable to all contractor NAL employees that are part of the warmtransfer flow for each and every caller. Furthermore, this data repository shall have near-real time (NRT) capabilities for reporting to outside GOV sources as defined in the SOW and other documents. OR 2D. The NAL service will work to support the MHS Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) initiative. CSRs will be required to access the General Inquiry of DEERS application for each TRICARE Prime MTF-enrolled beneficiary to determine whether the beneficiary is enrolled to a PCMH. In cases where the caller is assigned to a PCMH and the respective military service has determined that the beneficiary should be rerouted to their respective PCMH (as indicated in GIQD), the CSR will acknowledge that the time zone of the caller corresponds to local normal business hours (as indicated in GIQD) and then transfer to their PCMH for assistance. If the beneficiary calls during non-business hours, the CSR will warm-transfer the call to the NAL Telehealth Nurse for service. 3. TELEHEALTH NURSE The telehealth nurse will be responsible for acknowledging receipt of the caller's information in the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System before the CSR terminates their connection. With this information, the telehealth nurse will conduct further dialogue with the beneficiary to determine how to best meet their specific health concerns/needs. This dialogue with pertinent information will also be recorded in the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System that will provide either algorithm or guideline-based care protocols for effective triage. These protocols and the RT NAL Encounter Information System will be provided and maintained by the NAL contractor. Telehealth Nurses will be assigned by the contractor to perform primary care triage/advice. The contractor will also staff Telehealth Nurses with Pediatric, Women's Health/OB, and Mental Health specialties. As a general performance standard, Telehealth Nurses will be expected to answer 5-6 beneficiary calls per hour. Telehealth Nurses with the pediatric specialty will be expected to answer 3-4 calls per hour with additional callbacks as deemed reasonable and as necessary. The NAL contractor must provide a pool of qualified and state licensed Telehealth Nurses that will ensure 24/7 coverage for all 50 states. Each Telehealth Nurse must have a minimum of 2 years of experience in primary care, or if a specialist, 2 years within that specialty (e.g. ­ Pediatrics). Telehealth nurses must be licensed to provide healthcare advice to beneficiaries within specific states; therefore they must be in compliance with individual state licensure and Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) requirements. 3A. The Telehealth Nurse determines if the beneficiary needs a post-triage appointment or would be best served by self care.

Page | 3

3B. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by self care, they will advise the beneficiary/caller as to an appropriate method for self care. The Telehealth nurse, if appropriate (especially with pediatric cases), will also inquire as to whether or not the beneficiary/caller wishes to have a telehealth nurse call them back for re-assessment health care advice. 3C. If the beneficiary does not wish to have a call back, the Telehealth nurse will close the case and the beneficiary will pursue self care independently. 3D. After the call back the Telehealth nurse will re-evaluate the beneficiary/caller for further triage and decide to either direct the beneficiary/caller into the care system or close the case as self-care. 3E. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by an urgent care facility authorization or a MTF acute/Open Access (ACUTE/OPAC) appointment, the Telehealth Nurse will warm transfer (stay on the line with the beneficiary/caller to facilitate the transfer of information) the caller to the Appointment Clerk. 3F. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by emergency care, they will advise the beneficiary to seek immediate care at the nearest emergency care center. 3G. For each scenario 3B-3F, the Telehealth Nurse will compile the encounter data within the NAL Encounter Information System in real time (RT) detailing all discussion and medical advice that was given to the beneficiary. The data resulting from the telehealth nurse triage will be deposited in near real time (NRT) into the NAL data repository that is owned and maintained by the NAL contractor (see section 9). 4. SELF CARE If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by self care, the beneficiary/caller will be advised by the Telehealth Nurse as to an appropriate method for self care. The beneficiary may call back if they so choose. The beneficiary/caller may also request a call back from the Telehealth nurse for follow-on evaluation. Note: If the beneficiary/caller chooses to call back themselves, they will need to access the system via 1-800-TRICARE vice calling a specific Telehealth Nurse directly. Also, if they choose to call back, they will be served by the first available Telehealth Nurse. If the beneficiary opts for the Telehealth Nurse to call them back, they will be contacted by that specific Telehealth Nurse. 5. NAL APPOINTING

Page | 4

Appointing Clerks (AC) will receive the beneficiary's background information from the contractor's RT NAL encounter information system and confirmed by either the CSR or the Telehealth Nurse under the warm-transfer to allow the AC to assume the service from that point forward (continued below). For MTF primary care ONLY appointment cancellation/rescheduling (see section 2B). 5A(1). The NAL AC must re-verify utilizing the RT NAL Encounter Information System if the caller is a TRICARE Prime (MTF or civilian), TRICARE Plus, TRICARE Standard or some other non-TRICARE Prime beneficiary. 5A(2). When the telehealth nurse data in the NAL Encounter Information System states book for urgent primary care, the AC re-verifies with the beneficiary/caller on Prime status (MTF or Civilian Enrolled) and location of call to the callers Prime enrollment site. 5B. For non-TRICARE Prime beneficiaries, the AC will provide a provider locator function to ensure the contact information provided on providers in the TRICARE provider network are based on the beneficiary's/caller's location and within 30 minutes of the calling beneficiary's local zip code or address. Note: these non-TRICARE Prime beneficiaries are not required to obtain care within the TRICARE provider network, but it is highly encouraged and the AC must exhaust all measures to locate a network provider/UCC before providing non-network provider information. 5C. If the beneficiary is an MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiary and they are in their home location, the AC must determine if the beneficiary can be booked to their enrolled MTF for an ACUTE/OPAC primary care ONLY appointment. 5D (1). If the caller is an MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiary at their home location, the AC will utilize guidance from the Telehealth nurse as well as the standard appointing guidance found in Attachment 4 to book an ACUTE/OPAC primary care ONLY appointment. 5D (2). If the MTF-based TRICARE Prime beneficiary (Plus is non-transferrable to another MTF) is out-of-area from their home location and is in proximity (30 min drive time) of another MTF, the MTF-based Prime beneficiary can access a MTF-sponsored Urgent Care Center, which does not require an appointment. If the beneficiary has previously indicated to the CSR they have other health insurance (OHI), the AC shall request that the beneficiary bring in their OHI information with them to their appointment. 5E. If there are no MTF appointments available or if the out-of-area TRICARE Prime beneficiary chooses to pursue care on the provider network, the beneficiary will be offered an urgent care authorization (as approved by the Telehealth Nurse) for a nearby TRICARE network provide or urgent care facility that is part of the TRICARE private sector care network.

Page | 5

5F. If there are no MTF appointments available for a TRICARE Plus beneficiary, the AC will, as a courtesy, offer to provide a listing of TRICARE network providers to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary declines this offer, they are free to pursue care as deemed appropriate or as allowed by the TRICARE Plus plan.

5G. If the information provided to the AC by the teleheath nurse data in the RT NAL Encounter Information System and TRICARE Prime beneficiary results in the need for a civilian TRICARE network urgent care encounter, the AC will inform the beneficiary/caller that they have been approved for a referral to the nearest Urgent Care Facility or primary care provider that can meet the urgent medical needs of the beneficiary. 5H(1). The AC will record their final actions within the NAL Encounter Information System for collection in the NAL data repository. 5H(2). In the case that the MTF-based TRICARE Prime beneficiary cannot be booked to an MTF primary care ONLY appointment due to non-availability, the AC must record in the RT NAL Encounter Information System whether or not the MTF appointment nonavailability effected a local MTF Prime/Plus enrollee or an out-of-area MTF Prime enrolled elsewhere beneficiary. Special Note: Appointing at US Coast Guard Clinics. The US Coast Guard is currently engaged in migrating from the use of CHCS and AHLTA to the EPIC electronic health record. Similar appointing standards will be established to support TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries enrolled to US Coast Guard clinics. The CONUS NAL contractor will be expected to work with the NAL Program Management Office and US Coast Guard personnel to develop and implement appointing standards that best meet the needs of TRICARE beneficiaries. 6. TRICARE PROVIDER NETWORK CONTACT INFORMATION The AC will provide the caller with the contact information of the civilian Urgent Care facility utilizing the TRICARE Regional Managed Care Support Contractor's (MCSC) provider locator tool, which is available on their respective web sites. The URLs for the respective sites are: https://www.hnfs.com/content/hnfs/home/tn/common/app_help_pages/provider_directory .html/pp/content/hnfs/home/tn/bene/res/bene_forms; http://www.humanamilitary.com/south/bene/tools-resources/BeneSiteProvLoc.asp; http://www.triwest.com/ OnlineProviderDirectory/SearchProvider.aspx?id=Location.The AC will also inform both the beneficiary/caller that a notification of an urgent care facility authorization will be forwarded to the MTF or TRICARE Regional MCSC the caller is enrolled. The AC will also enter the UCA approval into the MCSC claims payment system. 6A. For TRICARE Prime beneficiaries seeking civilian TRICARE network or nonnetwork Urgent Care facility or primary care provider encounters, the AC shall be

Page | 6

responsible for forwarding notification of the authorization for urgent care to both the TRICARE regional MCSC where the care encounter took place and the TRICARE regional MCSC where the beneficiary/caller is enrolled in Prime. In many cases this will be the same TRICARE regional MCSC and thus only one entry is required. For TRICARE MTF-enrolled Prime beneficiaries, the AC shall be responsible for forwarding notification of the authorization for urgent care to the MTF the beneficiary is enrolled to. 7. TRICARE REGIONAL MANAGED CARE SUPPORT CONTRACTOR The NAL contractor will be responsible for working with all TRICARE Regional MCSCs as stated in the Performance Work Statement. 8. PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOME In support of the MHS Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) initiatives, designated representatives from each participating MTFs and civilian network providers will be provided to the NAL contractor via regularly scheduled POC updates (see also 9 DATA REPOSITORY). The NAL contractor is required to set-up Government pre-determined push reports providing specified data elements of NAL services rendered to beneficiaries enrolled to MTFs and TRICARE network providers (to include PCMHs). These push reports will cover a specified period of time and must be provided by the NAL contractor at least 3 specified times per calendar day as defined by the NAL PMO. The NAL contractor will ensure that the encounter data provided in each push report is not duplicated from one reporting period to another and is also archived and ad hoc retrievable for a period of time specified by the NAL PMO. PCMH representatives will be provided with this information to support their goal of improving communications with their PCMH enrolled beneficiaries. This information will assist their efforts should the PCMH representatives choose to follow up with beneficiaries' that have used the NAL service. 8A. In the case that a TRICARE beneficiary is referred to Self Care, PCMH representatives will be informed of this action in the aforementioned push report. The PCMH representatives will then be able to perform follow up evaluations at their discretion. 9. DATA REPOSITORY The NAL contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System and NRT data repository will be independent of any MHS information systems. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that this NRT data repository is NIST certified prior to housing any TRICARE beneficiary encounter data. The NAL contractor will be responsible for providing a series of standardized reports that represent information at the military service level, MTF macro, MTF clinic, and individual TRICARE network provider levels. The contractor

Page | 7

will also be responsible for providing push reports and ad hoc capable notification for up to 3 specified points of contact or 3 specific email accounts at each MTF/civilian TRICARE provider's office regarding NAL services rendered to beneficiaries Prime enrolled to either a MTF or TRICARE network provider. These push reports must be provided by the NAL contractor to various points of contact as defined by the NAL PMO. Access to the NAL contractor's data repository must be limited to Common Access Card (CAC) authentication for all recipients of the various push reports. 10. AHTLA TELEPHONE CONSULTS The NAL contractor appointing clerks will be responsible for posting the information contained in the caller encounter report for MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries into AHLTA using the telephone consult (TCON) function. For US Coast Guard clinic-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries, the appointing clerks will be responsible for posting the caller report into the EPIC electronic health record. 11. MTF OPERATIONS The NAL contractor will work with the MTFs through their Service specific Higher Headquarter Command and the NAL PMO to address customer service issues. MTFs will be responsible for ensuring POC information is accurate to ensure push reports and ad hoc permissions are up-to-date. Access to this data repository will be authorized for up to 3 specified POCs at each MTF. The NAL PMO will be responsible for establishing these contacts at each MTF, updating the POCs as-needed, and maintaining a current monthly listing.

12. LEADERSHIP ­ HA/TMA, MHS, TROs, DOD/SERVICES It is expected that the NAL service will generate a high degree of beneficiary satisfaction, MHS provider (MTF and Civilian) satisfaction, and return on investment. All of this information will be of interest to the leadership of HA/TMA, MHS, each of the TRICARE Regional Offices (TROs) and each of the DOD Military Services. The NAL PMO will provide timely updates to these respective leadership teams. Additional NAL standardized reports will also be made available to these groups. By design, the NAL contractor's NRT data repository must be able to generate standardized reports that represent information at the individual beneficiary category, MTF macro, MTF clinic, and Military Service levels. Access to this NRT data repository must be given to representatives at each MTF and representatives of the military services, HA/TMA, & MHS leadership teams as defined by the NAL Program Management Office (NAL PMO). The NAL contractor must also provide all related data to the NAL PMO for further data analysis.

Attachment 3c. - NAL Operations ­ TRICARE Prime/Plus
The following document contains an overview of the factors involved in the TRICARE CONUS Nurse Advice Line (NAL) operations for beneficiaries enrolled in either TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Plus. 1. TRICARE BENEFICIARIES The TRICARE NAL (henceforth referred to as NAL) service will be available 24/7/365 for approximately 9 million TRICARE beneficiaries throughout the world. All TRICARE beneficiaries may use this service consisting of telehealth nurse triage providing healthcare advice and possible urgent care facility authorization support while physically located in a United States location. The NAL will provide TRICARE Prime (and MTFbased TRICARE Plus) beneficiaries with customer service, telehealth nurse advice/triage, MTF-based appointment setting (when applicable), MTF primary care ONLY appointment cancellation and rescheduling services (Primed or Plus) as well as urgent care facility authorizations in the TRICARE purchased care network (Prime Only). 1A. TRICARE beneficiaries will initiate contact with the NAL by calling 1-800TRICARE (1-800-874-2273). ˇ By design, the caller will be greeted within 5 rings with the following message: "Thank you for calling 1-800-TRICARE. To reach the Nurse Advice Line, please press 1; for other TRICARE questions, please press 2; to hear this menu again, please press 3."

1B. Choose phone tree option #1 ˇ After pressing option #1, the caller will transferred via the contractor's automatic call distribution (ACD) system to a customer service representative (CSR). This transfer must be answered in person by the CSR within 20 seconds. 2. CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (CSR) Customer service representatives (CSR) will serve to acquire and verify with the caller and the official Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS), via General Inquire of DEERS (GIQD) important personal information; such as name, sponsors/individuals social security number or DoD Benefit Number, TRICARE enrollment status, if Prime (MTF or civilian enrolled; and then the location (state) where caller is physically located. Once the beneficiary's eligibility (via DEERS data) and core information is obtained as described above, the CSR shall inquire as to the beneficiary's rationale for the call (telehealth nurse advice or triage, or MTF-based primary care ONLY appointment cancellation/rescheduling), and if the request is for telehealth nurse advice/triage, briefly inquire as to the beneficiary's chief complaint (e.g. ­ beneficiary has an illness, ailment, injury, etc). All of this information must be recorded in the NAL contractor's real time (RT) NAL Encounter Information Database to be immediately available to the telehealth nurse and/or the NAL appointment clerks. The CSR will

Page | 1

warm-transfer the call either to a telehealth nurse or to the appointment clerk (for preexisting primary care ONLY appointment cancellation/rescheduling). This process must be completed within 3 minutes. Note: NAL callers (eligible MTF Prime/Plus beneficiaries) will not be allowed to schedule a new MTF primary care appointment without first having been triaged by the telehealth nurse. There are no exceptions to this rule. The CSRs will be employed and trained for this position by the NAL contractor. The CSRs will also receive additional training from the TRICARE Management Activity that will focus on the nature of the military health system as well as specific guidelines and standards for treating TRICARE beneficiaries. The intent of this additional training is to provide a more thorough understanding of the population served and their specific needs. 2A. The beneficiary will be warm-transferred by the CSR to the Telehealth Nurse. OR 2B. In cases where telehealth nurse triage is not necessary and the caller (MTF Prime/Plus enrolled only) requests to cancel a previously scheduled primary care ONLY appointment, the beneficiary will be warm-transferred by the CSR to the Appointing Clerk. The Appointing Clerk will receive the beneficiary's background information from the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System and verified by the CSR (if required) before the CSR disengages from the warm-transfer. Then the Appointing Clerk can provide cancellation service for pre-existing MTF primary care ONLY appointments. The Appointing Clerk will also reschedule, at the request of the beneficiary/caller, primary care ONLY appointments of a similar nature and to the same MTF provider as the original appointment. More details about Appointing Clerks are featured in section 5 and in Exhibit 3d 2C. The NAL Appointing Clerk will utilize the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System to record all discussion and assistance that was given to the beneficiary. Note: it is critical that all NAL encounter information be held within a data repository that is assessable to all contractor NAL employees that are part of the warm-transfer flow for each and every caller. Furthermore, this data repository shall have near-real time (NRT) capabilities for reporting to outside GOV sources as defined in the SOW and other documents. OR 2D. The NAL service will work to support the MHS Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) initiative. CSRs will be required to access the General Inquiry of DEERS application for each TRICARE Prime MTF-enrolled beneficiary to determine whether the beneficiary is enrolled to a PCMH. In cases where the caller is assigned to a PCMH and

Page | 2

the respective military service has determined that the beneficiary should be rerouted to their respective PCMH (as indicated in GIQD), the CSR will acknowledge that the time zone of the caller corresponds to local normal business hours (as indicated in GIQD) and then transfer to their PCMH for assistance. If the beneficiary calls during non-business hours, the CSR will warm-transfer the call to the NAL Telehealth Nurse for service. 3. TELEHEALTH NURSE The telehealth nurse will be responsible for acknowledging receipt of the caller's information in the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System before the CSR terminates their connection. With this information, the telehealth nurse will conduct further dialogue with the beneficiary to determine how to best meet their specific health concerns/needs. This dialogue with pertinent information will also be recorded in the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System that will provide either algorithm or guideline-based care protocols for effective triage. These protocols and the RT NAL Encounter Information System will be provided and maintained by the NAL contractor. Telehealth Nurses will be assigned by the contractor to perform primary care triage/advice. The contractor will also staff Telehealth Nurses with Pediatric, Women's Health/OB, and Mental Health specialties. As a general performance standard, Telehealth Nurses will be expected to answer 5-6 beneficiary calls per hour. Telehealth Nurses with the pediatric specialty will be expected to answer 3-4 calls per hour with additional callbacks as deemed reasonable and as necessary. The NAL contractor must provide a pool of qualified and state licensed Telehealth Nurses that will ensure 24/7 coverage for all 50 states. Each Telehealth Nurse must have a minimum of 2 years of experience in primary care, or if a specialist, 2 years within that specialty (e.g. ­ Pediatrics). Telehealth nurses must be licensed to provide healthcare advice to beneficiaries within specific states; therefore they must be in compliance with individual state licensure and Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) requirements. 3A. The Telehealth Nurse determines if the beneficiary needs a post-triage appointment or would be best served by self care. 3B. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by self care, they will advise the beneficiary/caller as to an appropriate method for self care. The Telehealth nurse, if appropriate (especially with pediatric cases), will also inquire as to whether or not the beneficiary/caller wishes to have a telehealth nurse call them back for re-assessment health care advice. 3C. If the beneficiary does not wish to have a call back, the Telehealth nurse will close the case and the beneficiary will pursue self care independently. 3D. After the call back the Telehealth nurse will re-evaluate the beneficiary/caller for further triage and decide to either direct the beneficiary/caller into the care system or close the case as self-care.

Page | 3

3E. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by an urgent care facility authorization or a MTF ACUTE/Open Access (OPAC) appointment, the Telehealth Nurse will warm transfer (stay on the line with the beneficiary/caller to facilitate the transfer of information) the caller to the Appointment Clerk. 3F. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by emergency care, they will advise the beneficiary to seek immediate care at the nearest emergency care center. 3G. For each scenario 3B-3F, the Telehealth Nurse will compile the encounter data within the NAL Encounter Information System in real time (RT) detailing all discussion and medical advice that was given to the beneficiary. The data resulting from the telehealth nurse triage will be deposited in near real time (NRT) into the NAL data repository that is owned and maintained by the NAL contractor (see section 9). 4. SELF CARE If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by self care, the beneficiary/caller will be advised by the Telehealth Nurse as to an appropriate method for self care. The beneficiary may call back if they so choose. The beneficiary/caller may also request a call back from the Telehealth nurse for follow-on evaluation. Note: If the beneficiary/caller chooses to call back themselves, they will need to access the system via 1-800-TRICARE vice calling a specific Telehealth Nurse directly. Also, if they choose to call back, they will be served by the first available Telehealth Nurse. If the beneficiary opts for the Telehealth Nurse to call them back, they will be contacted by that specific Telehealth Nurse. 5. MTF OR CIVILIAN BASED CARE Appointing Clerks (AC) will receive the beneficiary's background information from the contractor's RT NAL encounter information system and confirmed by either the CSR or the Telehealth Nurse under the warm-transfer to allow the AC to assume the service from that point forward (continued below). For MTF primary care ONLY appointment cancellation/rescheduling see section 2B. When the telehealth nurse data in the RT NAL Encounter Information System states book for urgent primary care, the AC re-verifies with the beneficiary/caller on Prime status (MTF or Civilian Enrolled) and location of call to enrollment site. 5A. MTF based appointments shall be pursued for all TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries enrolled to a MTF.

Page | 4

5B. Urgent care authorizations shall be pursued for all TRICARE Prime beneficiaries enrolled to one of the Regional Managed Care Support Contractors (MCSC).

6. MTF Appointing 6A. If the beneficiary is an MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiary and they are in their home location, the AC must determine if the beneficiary can be booked to their enrolled MTF for an ACUTE/OPAC primary care ONLY appointment. ˇ If the caller is an MTF-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiary at their home location, the AC will utilize guidance found in Attachment 4 to book an ACUTE /OPAC primary care ONLY appointment. . If the MTF-based TRICARE Prime beneficiary (Plus is non-transferrable to another MTF) is out-of-area from their home location and is in proximity (30 min drive time) of another MTF, the MTF-based Prime beneficiary can access a MTF-sponsored Urgent Care Center, which does not require an appointment. If the beneficiary has previously indicated to the CSR they have other health insurance (OHI), the AC shall request that the beneficiary bring in their OHI information with them to their appointment.

ˇ

6B. If there are no MTF appointments available or if the out-of-area TRICARE Prime beneficiary chooses to pursue care on the provider network, the beneficiary will be offered an urgent care authorization and a listing of nearby TRICARE network providers and Urgent Care Centers. . 6C. If there are no MTF appointments available for a TRICARE Plus beneficiary, the AC will, as a courtesy, offer to provide a listing of TRICARE network providers to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary declines this offer, they are free to pursue care as deemed appropriate or as allowed by the TRICARE Plus plan. 6D. The AC will record their final actions within the RT NAL Encounter Information System for collection in the NAL data repository. In the case that the MTF-based TRICARE Prime beneficiary cannot be booked to an MTF primary care ONLY appointment due to non-availability, the AC must record in the RT NAL Encounter Information System whether or not the MTF appointment non-availability effected a local MTF Prime/Plus enrollee or an out-of-area MTF Prime enrolled elsewhere beneficiary. Special Note: Appointing at US Coast Guard Clinics. The US Coast Guard is currently engaged in migrating from the use of CHCS and AHLTA to the EPIC electronic health record. Similar appointing standards will be established to support TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries enrolled to US Coast Guard clinics. The CONUS NAL contractor will be expected to work with the NAL Program Management Office and US Coast Guard

Page | 5

personnel to develop and implement appointing standards that best meet the needs of TRICARE beneficiaries. 7. Urgent Care Authorization for Civilian Provider Network Care 7A. If the information provided to the AC by the teleheath nurse data in the RT NAL Encounter Information System and beneficiary results in the need for a civilian TRICARE network urgent care encounter, the AC will provide the caller with an authorization to pursue care at the nearest Urgent Care Facility or TRICARE network provider that can meet the urgent medical needs of the beneficiary. The AC will also inform both the beneficiary/caller and the TRICARE regional MCSC that an urgent care facility authorization will be forwarded to the TRICARE regional MCSC for this specific encounter. 7B. The AC will forward a notification of the urgent care authorization to the TRICARE Regional MCSC or MTF caller enrolled to. 8. PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOME In support of the MHS Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) initiatives, designated representatives from each participating MTFs and civilian network providers will be provided to the NAL contractor via regularly scheduled POC updates (see also 9 DATA REPOSITORY). The NAL contractor is required to set-up Government pre-determined push reports providing specified data elements of NAL services rendered to beneficiaries enrolled to MTFs and TRICARE network providers (to include PCMHs). These push reports will cover a specified period of time and must be provided by the NAL contractor at least 3 specified times per calendar day as defined by the NAL PMO. The NAL contractor will ensure that the encounter data provided in each push report is not duplicated from one reporting period to another and is also archived and ad hoc retrievable for a period of time specified by the NAL PMO. PCMH representatives will be provided with this information to support their goal of improving communications with their PCMH enrolled beneficiaries. This information will assist their efforts should the PCMH representatives choose to follow up with beneficiary that have used the NAL service. 8A. In the case that a TRICARE beneficiary is referred to Self Care, PCMH representatives will be informed of this action in the aforementioned push report. The PCMH representatives will then be able to perform follow up evaluations at their discretion.

The NAL contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System and NRT data repository will be independent of any MHS information systems. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that this NRT data repository is NIST certified prior to housing any TRICARE beneficiary encounter data. The NAL contractor will be responsible for providing a series of standardized reports that represent information at the military service level, MTF macro, MTF clinic, and individual TRICARE network provider levels. The contractor will also be responsible for providing push reports and ad hoc capable notification for up to 3 specified points of contact or 3 specific email accounts at each MTF/civilian TRICARE provider's office regarding NAL services rendered to beneficiaries Prime enrolled to either a MTF or TRICARE network provider. These push reports must be provided by the NAL contractor to various points of contact as defined by the NAL PMO. Access to the NAL contractor's data repository must be limited to Common Access Card (CAC) authentication for all recipients of the various push reports. 10. AHTLA TELEPHONE CONSULTS The NAL contractor appointing clerks will be responsible for posting the information contained in the caller encounter report for MTF-based and private sector enrolled TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries into AHLTA using the telephone consult (TCON) function. For US Coast Guard clinic-based TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries, the appointing clerks will be responsible for posting the caller report into the EPIC electronic health record. 11. MTF OPERATIONS The NAL contractor will work with the MTFs through their Service specific Higher Headquarter Command and the NAL PMO to address customer service issues. MTFs will be responsible for ensuring POC information is accurate to ensure push reports and ad hoc permissions are up-to-date. Access to this data repository will be authorized for up to 3 specified POCs at each MTF and civilian TRICARE network provider. The NAL PMO will be responsible for establishing these contacts at each MTF, updating the POCs as-needed, and maintaining a current monthly listing. The NAL PMO will be responsible for obtaining civilian TRICARE network POC information from the TRICARE regional MCSCs. 12. LEADERSHIP ­ HA/TMA, MHS, TROs, DOD/SERVICES It is expected that the NAL service will generate a high degree of beneficiary satisfaction, MHS provider (MTF and Civilian) satisfaction, and return on investment. All of this information will be of interest to the leadership of HA/TMA, MHS, each of the TRICARE Regional Offices (TROs), and each of the DOD Military Services. The NAL PMO will provide timely updates to these respective leadership teams. Additional NAL standardized reports will also be made available to these groups.

By design, the NAL contractor's NRT data repository must be able to generate standardized reports that represent information at the individual beneficiary category, MTF macro, MTF clinic, and Military Service levels. Access to this NRT data repository must be given to representatives at each MTF and representatives of the military services, HA/TMA, & MHS leadership teams as defined by the NAL Program Management Office (NAL PMO). The NAL contractor must also provide all related data to the NAL PMO for further data analysis.

Attachment 3e. - NAL Operations ­ TRICARE Standard
The following document contains an overview of the factors involved in the TRICARE CONUS Nurse Advice Line (NAL) operations for beneficiaries enrolled to TRICARE Standard. 1. TRICARE BENEFICIARIES The TRICARE NAL (henceforth referred to as NAL) service will be available 24/7/365 for approximately 9 million TRICARE beneficiaries throughout the world. All TRICARE beneficiaries may use this service consisting of telehealth nurse triage providing healthcare advice and possible urgent care facility authorization support while physically located in a United States location. The NAL will provide TRICARE Standard, TRICARE for Life, and all other non-TRICARE Prime beneficiaries with customer service, telehealth nurse advice/triage, and provider locator plus contact information for TRICARE purchased care network providers. 1A. TRICARE beneficiaries will initiate contact with the NAL by calling 1-800TRICARE (1-800-874-2273). ˇ By design, the caller will be greeted within 5 rings with the following message: "Thank you for calling 1-800-TRICARE. To reach the Nurse Advice Line, please press 1; for other TRICARE questions, please press 2; to hear this menu again, please press 3."

1B. Choose phone tree option #1 ˇ After pressing option #1, the caller will transferred via the contractor's automatic call distribution (ACD) system to a customer service representative (CSR). This transfer must be answered in person by the CSR within 20 seconds. 2. CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE (CSR) Customer service representatives (CSR) will serve to acquire and verify with the caller and the official Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System (DEERS), via General Inquire of DEERS (GIQD) important personal information; such as name, sponsors/individuals social security number and/or DoD Benefit Number, TRICARE enrollment status, and then the location (state) where caller is physically located. Once the beneficiary's eligibility (via DEERS data) and core information is obtained as described above, the CSR shall inquire as to the beneficiary's rationale for the call (telehealth nurse advice or triage), and if the request is for telehealth nurse advice/triage, briefly inquire as to the beneficiary's chief complaint (e.g. - beneficiary has an illness, ailment, injury, etc). All of this information must be recorded in the NAL contractor's real time (RT) NAL Encounter Information Database to be immediately available to the telehealth nurse and/or the NAL appointment clerks. The CSR will warm-transfer the call to a telehealth nurse. This process must be completed within 3 minutes.

Page | 1

The CSRs will be employed and trained for this position by the NAL contractor. The CSRs will also receive additional training from the TRICARE Management Activity that will focus on the nature of the military health system as well as specific guidelines and standards for treating TRICARE beneficiaries. The intent of this additional training is to provide a more thorough understanding of the population served and their specific needs. 2A. The beneficiary will be warm-transferred by the CSR to the Telehealth Nurse. 3. TELEHEALTH NURSE The telehealth nurse will be responsible for acknowledging receipt of the caller's information in the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System before the CSR terminates their connection. With this information, the telehealth nurse will conduct further dialogue with the beneficiary to determine how to best meet their specific health concerns/needs. This dialogue with pertinent information will also be recorded in the contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System that will provide either algorithm or guideline-based care protocols for effective triage. These protocols and the RT NAL Encounter Information System will be provided and maintained by the NAL contractor. Telehealth Nurses will be assigned by the contractor to perform primary care triage/advice. The contractor will also staff Telehealth Nurses with Pediatric, Women's Health/OB, and Mental Health specialties. As a general performance standard, Telehealth Nurses will be expected to answer 5-6 beneficiary calls per hour. Telehealth Nurses with the pediatric specialty will be expected to answer 3-4 calls per hour with additional callbacks as deemed reasonable and as necessary. The NAL contractor must provide a pool of qualified and state licensed Telehealth Nurses that will ensure 24/7 coverage for all 50 states. Each Telehealth Nurse must have a minimum of 2 years of experience in primary care, or if a specialist, 2 years within that specialty (e.g. ­ Pediatrics). Telehealth nurses must be licensed to provide healthcare advice to beneficiaries within specific states; therefore they must be in compliance with individual state licensure and Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) requirements. 3A. The Telehealth Nurse determines if the beneficiary needs a post-triage appointment or would be best served by ER, urgent care, MTF care, or self care. 3B. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by self care, they will advise the beneficiary/caller as to an appropriate method for self care. The Telehealth nurse, if appropriate (especially with pediatric cases), will also inquire as to whether or not the beneficiary/caller wishes to have a telehealth nurse call them back for re-assessment health care advice. 3C. If the beneficiary does not wish to have a call back, the Telehealth nurse will close the case and the beneficiary will pursue self care independently.

Page | 2

3D. After the call back the Telehealth nurse will re-evaluate the beneficiary/caller for further triage and decide to either direct the beneficiary/caller into the care system or close the case as self-care. 3E. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by care at an urgent care facility, the caller will be warm transferred to the appointing clerk for provider locator assistance (see section 5). 3F. If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by emergency care, they will advise the beneficiary to seek immediate care at the nearest emergency care center. 3G. For each scenario 3B-3F, the Telehealth Nurse will compile the encounter data within the NAL Encounter Information System in real time (RT) detailing all discussion and medical advice that was given to the beneficiary. The data resulting from the telehealth nurse triage will be deposited in near real time (NRT) into the NAL data repository that is owned and maintained by the NAL contractor (see section 6). 4. SELF CARE If the Telehealth Nurse determines that the beneficiary/caller would best be served by self care, the beneficiary/caller will be advised by the Telehealth Nurse as to an appropriate method for self care. The beneficiary may call back if they so choose. The beneficiary/caller may also request a call back from the Telehealth nurse for follow-on evaluation. Note: If the beneficiary/caller chooses to call back themselves, they will need to access the system via 1-800-TRICARE vice calling a specific Telehealth Nurse directly. Also, if they choose to call back, they will be served by the first available Telehealth Nurse. If the beneficiary opts for the Telehealth Nurse to call them back, they will be contacted by that specific Telehealth Nurse. 5. TRICARE NETWORK CARE For TRICARE Standard and all other non-Prime beneficiaries, the AC will provide a provider locator function to ensure the contact information provided on providers in the TRICARE provider network are based on the beneficiary's/caller's location and within 30 minutes of the calling beneficiary's local zip code or address. Note: these TRICARE Standard and non-TRICARE Prime beneficiaries are not required to obtain care within the TRICARE provider network, but it is highly encouraged and the AC must exhaust all measures to locate a network provider/UCC before providing non-network provider information.

6. DATA REPOSITORY The NAL contractor's RT NAL Encounter Information System and data repository will be independent of any MHS information systems. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that this NRT data repository is NIST certified prior to housing any TRICARE beneficiary encounter data. The NAL contractor will be responsible for providing a series of standardized reports that represent aggregate information. The contractor will also be responsible for providing push reports and ad hoc capable notification for various points of contact as determined by the NAL Program Management Office (NAL PMO). Access to the NAL contractor's data repository must limited to Common Access Card (CAC) authentication for all recipients of the various push reports. 7. LEADERSHIP ­ HA/TMA, MHS, TROs, DOD/SERVICES It is expected that the NAL service will generate a high degree of beneficiary satisfaction, MHS provider (MTF and Civilian) satisfaction, and return on investment. All of this information will be of interest to the leadership of HA/TMA, MHS, each of the TRICARE Regional Offices (TROs), and each of the DOD Military Services. The NAL PMO will provide timely updates to these respective leadership teams. Additional NAL standardized reports will also be made available to these groups. By design, the NAL contractor's NRT data repository must be able to generate standardized reports that represent information at multiple levels. Access to this NRT data repository must be given to representatives of the military services, HA/TMA, & MHS leadership teams as defined by the NAL PMO. The NAL contractor must also provide all related data to the NAL PMO for further data analysis.

Exhibit 3 Nurse Advice Line ­ MTF-Based Appointing Service Process/Procedures/Standards

1. MTF Appointment Management. NAL contractor personnel, specifically appointing clerks (AC) are only authorized to make MTF-based Acute/OPAC primary care appointments for NAL MTF Prime/Plus Enrolled callers based on the direction of a Telehealth Nurse for a specific triage episode or at the request of the caller to cancel and reschedule an acute/Open Access (OPAC) appointment. This shall not include appointment joining, splitting, or changing appointment types, etc within the local CHCS host. The terms patient and beneficiary are synonymous. The NAL contractor shall follow Appointment Processing Standardization Phase III (APS III). 2. MTF Appointment Booking Procedures. 2.a. The AC may receive and or initiate a beneficiary appointment request through a warm transfer from either the teleheath nurse. The beneficiary's request for Acute/OPAC primary care appointment service shall be booked according to the guidance received from the Telehealth nurse and following MHS directives using the appropriate Access to Care (ATC) category matched to the appropriate Acute/OPAC primary care appointment types and detail codes within the appropriate ATC standards of 24 hours (Acute/OPAC). 2.b. For all NAL appointing of MTF Prime/Plus enrolled to their MTF of enrollment, the beneficiary's request for Acute/OPAC primary care appointment service shall be booked according to the guidance received from the Telehealth nurse and following MHS directives using the appropriate Access To Care (ATC) category matched to the appropriate Acute/OPAC primary care appointment types and detail codes within the appropriate ATC standards of 24 hours (Acute/OPAC). The NAL AC will ensure that the Acute/OPAC primary care appointment is first assigned to the beneficiary's assigned PCM and if not available, to another PCM in the PCM's Team/Group. 2.c. When no MTF appointments are available for Acute/OPAC care within the access to care standard of 24 hours or based on the urgency of the telehealth nurse advice, the AC shall inform the beneficiary that the AC's support will move toward providing civilian Urgent Care provider locator support. For all MTF Prime beneficiaries, the AC will provide the MTF Prime beneficiary with provider locator services and inform the beneficiary that an authorization for urgent care has been approved and the notification of this approval will be forwarded both of the TRICARE regional Managed Care Support Contractors (MCSC) where the care will take place and where the MTF Prime enrolled beneficiary is enrolled. 2.d. All calls from MTF Prime enrolled beneficiaries that do not result in an appointment in either an MTF or TRICARE network will be documented utilizing the real time NAL Encounter Information System .

1

3. Non-MTF/TRICARE Provider Network Appointment Booking Procedures. The CONUS NAL will not be providing appointment setting services within Civilian PCM practices. This service may be added as a function of the CONUS NAL at the convenience of the government. 4. MTF Appointment Cancellation/Reschedule Procedures. 4.a. The AC shall cancel, and if appropriate, reschedule beneficiary appointments at the request of the beneficiary using the appropriate Government appointing information system cancellation procedures and must maintain the initial access to care standards and assigned MTF provider for MTF cancellations/rescheduling. 4.b. If a cancellation request is received from the beneficiary, the AC shall cancel the appointment and offer to reschedule the appointment using the appropriate Government appointing information system cancellation procedures. When an appointment is canceled and cancelled/rescheduled, the AC shall record this in the real time NAL Encounter Information System to notify the MTF clinic as specified by the contract business rules. 5. MTF Appointing Call Monitoring. The Contractor shall perform monthly monitoring of calls handled by the Contractor's AC staff to identify any customer service or training issues. The monitoring plan shall include acceptable standards and planned corrective actions for below standard performance. At a minimum, random agent monitoring will include monitoring of verbal communication between AC and beneficiary, appropriate use of CHCS appointment search/booking criteria and actual appointment booking (matching the right appointment with the right clinic, PCM and beneficiary). No less than 1% of the total monthly volume of calls will be audited/monitored. Access to the monitoring equipment shall also be made available to the COTR and or a COTR approved designee for periodic monitoring as deemed necessary. Monthly, the contractor shall provide a report to the COR the number of calls monitored, agents monitored, issues identified, and corrective actions taken to correct the issues. 6. Appointing at US Coast Guard Clinics. At this time, the US Coast Guard is currently engaged in migrating from the use of CHCS and AHLTA to the EPIC electronic health record. Similar appointing standards will be established to support TRICARE Prime/Plus beneficiaries enrolled to US Coast Guard clinics. The CONUS NAL contractor will be expected to work with the NAL Program Management Office and US Coast Guard personnel to develop and implement appointing standards that best meet the needs of TRICARE beneficiaries.

Exhibit 4. The contractor will need to be aware of the following TRICARE beneficiary demographic data for planning purposes. The following data are based on current beneficiary enrollment data. Although the exact number values are subject to change, this information may be used as a good estimate for ongoing beneficiary enrollment by beneficiary category and geographic location. CONUS NAL Enrollment Estimates:  All TRICARE CONUS beneficiaries are eligible to use the CONUS NAL service. The following chart indicates the annual utilization estimates. The NAL Contractor should anticipate changes to this estimate throughout the duration of the contract.
Beneficiary Type MTF-Enrolled TRICARE Prime/Plus MCSC-Enrolled TRICARE Prime TRICARE Standard Total Year 1 2,866,761 1,675,750 4,395,292 8,937,803 Year 2 2,872,495 1,679,102 4,404,308 8,955,905 Year 3 2,878,240 1,682,460 4,413,342 8,974,042 Year 4 2,883,996 1,685,824 4,422,396 8,992,216 Year 5 2,889,764 1,685,824 4,434,838 9,010,426



There are 602,461 TRICARE OCONUS beneficiaries located outside of CONUS. Although these OCONUS TRICARE beneficiaries are not enrolled to CONUS MTFs, they are eligible to use the CONUS NAL service while in-transit through the CONUS region. The usage of the CONUS NAL by OCONUS beneficiaries is expected to be minimal.

CONUS NAL Performance Estimates:  Based on an extensive review of private industry and military-sponsored NALs, the estimated call volume is expected to vary by beneficiary category and by contract year. The following chart indicates the annual utilization estimates. NAL Utilization by Enrollee Type
PRIME Enrolled to MTF PRIME Enrolled to MCSC Other Eligibles Cumulative Total

Year 1 375,000 150,000 412,500 937,500

Year 1 93,750

Year 2 150,000

Year 3 175,000

Year 4 200,000

Year 5 225,000

CONUS NAL Staffing Estimates  For staffing purposes, it is the expectation of the government that the triage nurses employed by the CONUS NAL for providing primary care coverage will service approximately 5-6 beneficiary calls per hour. It is also the expectation that the pediatric triage nurses employed by the CONUS NAL will service approximately 3-4 calls per hour as well as provide a higher degree of patient call-backs. These estimates are based on telehealth industry standards. For staffing purposes, it is the expectation of the government that the customer service representatives employed by the CONUS NAL for providing primary care coverage will service approximately 15 beneficiary calls per hour. It is also the expectation of the government that the appointing clerks employed by the CONUS NAL for providing primary care coverage will service approximately 7-8 beneficiary calls per hour.



The following 2 tables will further illustrate the breakdown of the types of eligible beneficiaries and their respective volumes. The NAL Contractor should anticipate changes to these estimates throughout the duration of the contract. Table 1. Composite TRICARE beneficiary demographics
