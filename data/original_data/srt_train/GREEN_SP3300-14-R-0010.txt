(a) Work to be performed under this contract or task order may, in full or in part, be performed at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Headquarters (HQ) or other DLA field activity office(s), with physical access to a Federally-controlled facility. Prior to beginning work on a contract, DLA and its field activity offices require all contractor personnel working on the Federally-controlled facility to have a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or NACI equivalent. (b) Additionally, in accordance with Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Programs, and DLA Issuance 4314, Personnel Security Program, all DoD Contractor personnel who have access to Federally-controlled information systems must be assigned to positions which are designated at one of three information technology (IT) levels, each requiring a certain level of investigation and clearance, as follows: (1) IT-I for an IT position requiring a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or SSBI equivalent; (2) IT-II for an IT position requiring a National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) or NACLC equivalent; and (3) IT-III for an IT position requiring a NACI or equivalent. Note: IT levels will be designated according to the criteria in DoD 5200.2-R. (c) Previously completed security investigations may be accepted by the Government in lieu of new investigations if determined by the DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office to be essentially equivalent in scope to the contract requirements. The length of time elapsed since the previous investigation will also be considered in determining whether a new investigation is warranted. To assist the Government in making this determination, the Contractor must provide the following information to the respective DLA Personnel Security Office immediately upon receipt of the contract. This information must be provided for each Contractor employee who will perform work on a Federally-controlled facility and/or will require access to Federally-controlled information systems: (1) Full name, with middle name, as applicable, with social security number; (2) Citizenship status with date and place of birth; (3) Proof of the individual's favorably adjudicated background investigation or NACI, consisting of identification of the type of investigation performed, date of the favorable adjudication, and name of the agency that performed the investigation; (4) Company name, address, phone and fax numbers with email address; (5) Location of on-site workstation or phone number if off-site (if known by the time of award); and (6) Delivery order or contract number and expiration date; and name of the Contracting Officer. (d) The Contracting Officer will ensure that the contractor is notified as soon as a determination is made by the assigned or cognizant DLA Personnel Security Office regarding acceptance of the previous investigation and clearance level. (1) If a new investigation is deemed necessary, the Contractor and Contracting Officer will be notified by the respective DLA Personnel Security Office after appropriate checks in DoD databases have been made. (2) If the Contractor employee requires access to classified information and currently does not have the appropriate clearance level and/or an active security clearance, the DLA Personnel Security Office will relay this information to the Contractor and Contracting Officer for further action. (3) The Contracting Officer will ensure that the respective DLA Personnel Security Office initiates the investigation for the required clearance level(s) of the Contractor personnel.

(4) It is the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that adequate information is provided and that each Contractor employee completes the appropriate paperwork, as required either by the Contracting Officer or the DLA Personnel Security Office, in order to begin the investigation process for the required clearance level. (e) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that each Contractor employee assigned to the position has the appropriate security clearance level. (f) The Contractor shall submit each request for IT access and investigation through the contracting officer to the assigned or cognizant DLA Personnel Security Office. Requests shall include the following information and/or documentation: (1) Standard Form (SF) 85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, or the SF 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions (see note below); (2) Proof of citizenship (i.e., an original or a certified copy of a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization certificate); and (3) Form FD-258, fingerprint card (however, fingerprinting can be performed by the cognizant DLA Personnel Security Office). (Note to (f)(1) above: An investigation request is facilitated through use of the SF 85 or the SF 86. These forms with instructions as well as the Optional Form (OF) 306, Declaration for Federal Employment, which is required with submission of the SF85 or SF 86, are available at the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) system called Electronic ­Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Hard copies of the SF85 and SF86 are available at OPM's web-site, www.opm.gov, but hard copies of the forms are not accepted.) (g) Required documentation, listed above in paragraphs (f) (1) through (3), must be provided by the Contractor as directed by the Contracting Officer to the cognizant DLA Personnel Security Office at the time of fingerprinting or prior to the DLA Security Office releasing the investigation to the Office of Personnel Management. (h) Upon completion of the NACI, NACLC, SSBI, or other sufficient, appropriate investigation, the results of the investigation will be forwarded by the office performing the investigation to either the appropriate adjudication facility for eligibility determination or the DLA Intelligence Security Division for review and determination regarding the applicant's suitability to occupy an unescorted entry position in performance of the DLA contract. Contractor personnel shall not commence work on this effort until the investigation has been favorably adjudicated or has been waived into the position pending completion of adjudication. The DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office will ensure that results of investigations will be sent by the office performing the investigation to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) or DLA Intelligence Personnel Security Office. (i) A waiver for an IT-I or IT-II position to allow assignment of an individual Contractor employee to commence work prior to completion of the investigation may be granted in emergency situations when it is determined that a delay would be harmful to national security. A request for waiver will be considered only after the Government is in receipt of the individual Contractor employee's completed forms. The request for a waiver must be approved by the Commander/Director or an authorized representative of the site. The cognizant DLA Personnel Security Office reserves the right to determine whether a waiver request will be forwarded for processing, however, there will be no waiver for an IT-III position. The individual Contractor employee for which the waiver is being requested may not be assigned to a position, that is, physically work at the Federally-controlled facility and/or be granted access to Federally-controlled information systems, until the waiver has been approved. (j) The requirements of this clause apply to the prime Contractor and any subcontractors the prime Contractor may employ during the course of this contract, as well as any temporary employees that may be hired by the Contractor. The Government retains the right to request removal of Contractor personnel, regardless of prior clearance or adjudication status whose actions, while assigned to this contract, who are determined by the Contracting Officer to conflict with the interests of the Government. If such removal occurs, the Contractor shall assign qualified personnel, with the required investigation, to any vacancy. (k) All Contractor personnel who are granted access to Government and/or Federally-controlled information systems shall observe all local automated information system (AIS) security policies and procedures as provided by the DLA site Information Systems Security

Officer. Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password sharing, performing personal work, file access violations, or browsing files outside the scope of the contract, will result in removal of the Contractor employee from Government property and referral to the Contractor for appropriate disciplinary action. Actions taken by the Contractor in response to a violation will be evaluated and will be reflected in the Contractor's performance assessment for use in making future source selection decisions. In addition, based on the nature and extent of any violations of AIS security policy, the Government will consider whether it needs to pursue any other actions under the contract such as a possible termination. (l) The Contractor is also required to obtain a common access card (CAC) for each contractor employee in accordance with procedures established at the DLA HQ or field activity office. When a CAC is required, the Contracting Officer will ensure that the contractor follows the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12. (m) Contractor personnel must additionally receive operations security (OPSEC) and information security (INFOSEC) awareness training. The DLA annual OPSEC refresher training and DLA annual INFOSEC training will satisfy these requirements and are available through the DLA Intelligence Office. (n) When a Contractor employee who has been granted a clearance is removed from the contract, the Contractor shall provide an appropriately trained substitute who has met or will meet the investigative requirements of this clause. The substitute may not begin work on the contract without written documentation, signed by the Contracting Officer, stating that the new Contractor employee has met one of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), or (i) of this clause, (i.e., acceptance of a previously completed security investigation, satisfactory completion of a new investigation, or a waiver allowing work to begin pending completion of an investigation). Contractor individual employees removed from this contract as a result of a violation of local AIS security policy are removed for the duration of the contract. (o) The Contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, within 12 hours, when a Contractor employee working on this contract resigns, is reassigned, terminated or no longer requires admittance to the Federally-controlled facility or access to Federallycontrolled information systems. When the Contractor employee departs, the Contractor will relay departure information to the cognizant DLA Security Office so appropriate databases can be updated. The Contractor will ensure each departed employee has completed the DLA J6 Out-Processing Checklist, when applicable, for the necessary security briefing, has returned any Governmentfurnished equipment, returned the DoD CAC and DLA (or equivalent) badge, returned any DoD or DLA vehicle decal, and requested deletion of local area network account with a prepared Department of Defense (DD) form 2875. The Contractor will be responsible for any costs involved for failure to complete the out-processing, including recovery of Government property and investigation involved. (p) These Contractor security requirements do not excuse the Contractor from meeting the delivery schedule set forth in the contract, or waive the delivery schedule in any way. The Contractor shall meet the required delivery schedule unless the contracting officer grants a waiver or extension. (q) The Contractor shall not bill for personnel, who are not working on the contract while that Contractor employee's clearance investigation is pending.

http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ (End of Provision) DFARS 252.203-7005 Representation Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials (NOV 2011) Definition. "Covered DoD official" is defined in the clause at 252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials. (b) By submission of this offer, the offeror represents, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that all covered DoD officials employed by or otherwise receiving compensation from the offeror, and who are expected to undertake activities on behalf of the offeror for any resulting contract, are presently in compliance with all post-employment restrictions covered by 18 U.S.C. 207, 41 U.S.C. 2101-2107, and 5 CFR parts 2637 and 2641, including Federal Acquisition Regulation 3.104-2. (End of provision) DLAD 52.215-9023 Reverse Auction. (OCT 2013) The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify Offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply: (a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each Offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation. (b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide Offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the auction process. (c) Prior to conducting the reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the Offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing. (d) Unless auction instructions indicate that only Offeror's rankings will be displayed, the lowest Offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other Offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each Offeror's identity will be concealed from other Offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each Offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced Offeror"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, Offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other Offerors, during the reverse auction. (e) An Offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final price proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final price proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction. (f) The following requirements apply when the Government uses a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction: (1) Each Offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic Agency's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the Offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process. (2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such Offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its

service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is embedded within the email notification sent by the on-line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator. (3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other Offeror's pricing in confidence until after contract award. (4) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted and no evaluation factors other than price were identified in the solicitation, the "Not Lead" Offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; otherwise its offer will be ineligible for award if their final price in the auction is the tie offer price. If evaluation factors in addition to price were listed in the solicitation, tie offers that are "Not Lead" will be considered and evaluated in accordance with those evaluation factors. (5) Any Offerors unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the Offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the Offeror and outside the Offeror's control. (6) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection. (7) Training: (i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to Offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means. (ii) An employee of an Offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a "Trained Offeror." Only Trained Offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that Offerors provide an alternate Offeror employee to become a Trained Offeror. The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the Trained Offeror's designation from any Trained Offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions. (End of provision) DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests (Nov 2011) Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest (1) with the Contracting Officer, (2) with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), or (3) pursuant to Executive Order Number 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. (b) Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order Number 12979." (c) Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order Number 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this process is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer. Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.

(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. (b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the Contractor (see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal. Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. (c) The offeror should check here to opt out of this clause: [ ] Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer. (End of provision) DLAD 52.237-9002 Key Personnel ­ Fixed-Price Service Contracts (Apr 2008) (a) Certain skilled, experienced, professional and/or technical personnel are essential for successful accomplishment of the work to be performed under this contract. These are defined as "Key Personnel" and are those persons whose resumes were submitted as part of the technical/business proposal for evaluation. The Contractor agrees to use said key personnel during the performance of this contract and that they shall not be removed from the contract work or replaced unless authorized in accordance with this clause. (b) The Contractor shall not substitute key personnel assigned to perform work under this contract without the prior approval of the Contracting Officer. Requests for approval of substitutions shall be in writing and shall provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions. The request must contain a complete resume for the proposed substitute, and any other information requested or needed by the Contracting Officer to approve or disapprove the request. Proposed substitutes must have qualifications that are equal to or higher than the key personnel being replaced. The Contracting Officer or his authorized representative shall evaluate such requests and promptly notify the Contractor in writing whether the proposed substitution is acceptable. (c) If the Contracting Officer determines that (1) suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated or have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not reasonably forthcoming, or (2) the resultant substitution would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of the contract or the delivery order in accordance with the proposal accepted by the Government at time of contract award, the Contracting Officer may (1) terminate the contract for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate, or (2) at his discretion, if he finds the Contractor at fault for the condition, equitably adjust the contract price downward to compensate the Government for any resultant delay, loss or damage. (d) The provisions of this clause shall be fully applicable to any subcontract which may be entered into. (End of Provision) Instructions to Offerors This acquisition will be negotiated in accordance FAR Subpart 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 15--Contracting By Negotiations.

VOLUME I ­ TECHNICAL PROPOSAL The technical proposal should be written so that information technology oriented personnel can make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether the proposal meets the requirements of this solicitation. To this end, the technical proposal shall be specific, detailed and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective contractor has a thorough understanding of the technical requirements contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Statements such as "the Offeror understands", "will comply with the statement of work", "standard procedures will be employed", "well known techniques will be used", and general paraphrasing of the PWS are considered inadequate. The technical proposal must provide details concerning what the contractor will do and how it will be done. This includes a full explanation of the techniques, disciplines, and procedures proposed to be followed. The technical proposal shall not contain any reference to price; however, information concerning labor allocation and categories, labor hours, consultants, travel, materials, equipment, and other information of interest to technical reviewers shall be contained in the technical proposal in sufficient detail so that the Offeror's understanding of the scope of the work may be adequately evaluated. The technical proposal shall be page numbered, contain a table of contents, be organized in the following sections, and address in detail the following: PART 1: INTRODUCTION

The Offeror shall list, in matrix format, all key and non-key personnel proposed for assignment as discussed in Personnel Qualifications and Certifications section of the PWS, the labor category that they represent, their years of experience, degree/education, and their personnel qualifications and experience. In addition, the offeror shall submit the following information for key and non-key personnel: Key Personnel: The offeror shall identify proposed individual(s) for each labor position and indicate the tasks for which the person is proposed. Resumes shall be submitted for all key personnel to be assigned to the proposed contract. Resumes shall be marked as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in accordance with the Privacy Act requirements. Resumes shall include the relevant qualifications, background, experience, and accomplishments for all key personnel in sufficient detail to demonstrate the capability of such personnel to meet the requirements of the PWS. The work history of each key person should contain experience directly related to the tasks and functions he/she is intended to perform under the proposed contract. Resumes shall also include the labor category, for which the individual is being proposed, citizenship, level of security clearance, education (degrees and date of graduation, other schools and certificates, and training certifications). The offeror shall provide copies of all required certifications for Key Personnel and proof that the certifications are current, if it is not clearly indicated on the certificate. Additionally, many of the certifications have a continuing education requirement. The offering contractor shall provide proof that their proposed employees meet the continuing education requirements for the provided certifications. Offerors shall indicate limitations on the availability of proposed personnel, if any. If the individual is not currently employed by the offeror, explain the rationale for proposing that person. If a key person is not currently employed by the offeror or subcontractor, a letter of intent signed by the proposed personnel, contingent upon award of the contract, shall be included with that individual's resume. Resumes shall be provided for all proposed subcontractor personnel and consultants, and the rationale for their use. NOTE: If subcontractors are to be used, resumes of the key personnel shall be included in this section with the present company affiliation clearly identified. All of the requirements of this section shall apply to the use of subcontractor personnel, as well as the prime contractor's personnel. Non-Key Personnel: The Government has established certain minimum requirements for personnel which are considered essential for contract performance. These minimums are specified in the Personnel Qualifications and Certifications section of the PWS. The offeror shall provide a listing of non-key personnel and the labor category for which they are proposed. The individuals proposed must meet the qualifications specified for the labor category they are proposed for in accordance with the Personnel Qualifications and Certifications section of the PWS and the offeror shall certify to this fact. The offeror shall provide copies of all required certifications for Non-Key Personnel and proof that the certifications are current, if it is not clearly indicated on the certificate.

The Offeror shall provide an initial Quality Control Plan (QCP) in accordance with the PWS with their proposal. The QCP shall include an approach to maintaining acceptable quality standards throughout contract performance, and should address the methods for meeting the performance standards, customer requirements, and complying with applicable regulations. The plan shall provide the quality control methodology, processes, techniques, and tools that will result in meeting or exceeding the performance requirements for quality and timeliness.

The QCP should not be a reiteration of the Government's Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP), which is the Government's method for monitoring the quality of the Contractor's performance; instead, the QCP should be the Offeror's approach to ensure that the Acceptable Performance Levels are met and that quality is maintained throughout contract performance. VOLUME II ­ PAST PERFORMANCE

REFERENCE NO. OF DOCUMENT BEING CONTINUED: SP3300-14-R-0010

PAGE 49 OF 71 PAGES

The Offeror shall describe their background, knowledge and experience related to Information Technology Support Services. Of particular emphasis is performance that was executed in accordance with the same or similar scope and magnitude that is described in the PWS. Past performance information is used in determining the level of confidence the Government has for successful performance based upon the Offeror's actions under previously awarded, relevant contracts. The Government shall only consider relevant past performance data. To be considered relevant, the Offeror must demonstrate past execution of similar contracts in terms of scope, complexity, technology, magnitude of effort, and schedule. The Offeror must demonstrate through past performance an ability to perform the work described in the solicitation. This is done by demonstrating that they have successfully executed at least three (3) contracts of similar scope and magnitude within the past five (5) years. Offerors shall provide a detailed explanation of the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements as defined in the PWS. If subcontractor experience is provided as part of the three (3) most relevant contracts, it will be given weight relative to the percentage of effort being provided by that particular subcontractor in the offer submitted. The references will be evaluated in the aggregate in order to allow Offerors who may not have the entire scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement under one individual contract to still be considered relevant if experience with the full scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement can be demonstrated within the allotted number of references as described above. If an Offeror or its subcontractor determines they have no past performance data, they shall provide the following statement in lieu of the information requested below: "(Insert Offeror or subcontractor's name) has determined that they possess no past performance information in accordance with the RFP." To be compliant with this factor offerors shall provide the following information for both the Offeror and proposed subcontractors. (1) An index of previous contract data for the Offeror. The index shall contain three (3) or more PRIME contracts and SUBCONTRACTS that the Offeror is currently performing or has completed during the last five (5) years. The index shall include: - Contractor Name - Name of the customer/agency - Contract/Purchase Order Number - Customer points of contact (minimum of two, provide name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail addresses) - Length of contract - Period of performance (dates) - Initial Contract Price - Final Contract Price or price as of the last modification - Description of product/service provided (include sufficient detail to demonstrate the scope and complexity of the product/service provided) - Discussion of the similarities and differences of experience (include sufficient detail to demonstrate similarities/dissimilarities to the requirements of this solicitation) - Facilities in which the product/service was performed - Quality of Past Performance; to include a discussion of actual performance under each contract listed, including problems encountered; how they were resolved; the timeliness of deliverables required; how costs were controlled; business relationships; management of personnel, and any other areas deemed necessary to provide insight into actual performance issues (2) A narrative synopsis that shall describe the specific nature of the work, similarities with the

The appearance of cost growths and/or schedule delays on past contracts must be explained. (3) An index of Previous Contract Data for all subcontractors containing the information listed in (1) above as it relates to PRIME and SUBCONTRACTS that the subcontractor is currently performing or has completed during the last five (5) years. (4) Completion of the Past Performance Questionnaire attached to this solicitation. Offerors and all subcontractors shall send this questionnaire to previous customers of prime and subcontracts. All questionnaires shall be submitted to the Government by the proposal due date and time identified in the solicitation. All previous contracts the Offeror utilizes for Questionnaire information must be contained in the Previous Contract Data index for the Offeror/subcontractor. The Offeror/subcontractor shall complete the Previous Contract Data index prior to submitting the questionnaire to the customer. The Offeror/subcontractor shall ask the customer to complete the questionnaire and return it directly to the Contract Specialist identified in the solicitation. Government evaluation members may contact the named individuals to clarify, obtain additional information, or conduct a telephone survey of past performance. As such, the Offeror/subcontractor shall provide a list of all Questionnaires submitted that provides the following information: - Name of the customer/agency - Date submitted to customer/agency - Contract/Purchase Order Number - Customer points of contact (minimum of two, provide name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail addresses) - Whether the Offeror/subcontractor was a Prime or Subcontractor (5) Offerors and their subcontractors may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate technical excellence in the service requested.

Indicate what segment of the company (division or entire company) received the award or certification and the date. If the award or certification is over three years old, present evidence the qualifications still apply. The Government may utilize the Federal Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), responses received from the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire, data submitted by the Offeror, and any other information available to determine the quality and relevance of the Offeror's past performance.

Communications: The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and may seek to make an award without asking for revised proposals or entering substantive discussions. Accordingly, contractors are encouraged to provide their most realistic and competitive terms with their initial proposals. If the Contracting Officer does determine it is in the Government's best interest to conduct communications with offerors, and a contractor is given an opportunity to correct any deficiencies in a proposal, and after correction the proposal is still determined to be unacceptable, such determinations will be cause for rejection of the proposal. No offeror will be given an unlimited amount of opportunities for correction of a proposal. The Government reserves the right to make a final determination whether a proposal is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the information submitted and proceed without requesting additional information.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation ­ Commercial Items (JAN 1999) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1: Technical Capability
CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE

CONTINUATION SHEET

REFERENCE NO. OF DOCUMENT BEING CONTINUED: SP3300-14-R-0010

PAGE 53 OF 71 PAGES

Subfactor a: Technical Approach Subfactor b: Phase-In Plan Subfactor c: Section 508 Compliance Requirements Factor 2: Management Capability Subfactor a: Management Plan Subfactor b: Staffing Plan Factor 3: Quality Control Plan Factor 4: Past Performance Record Factor 5: Price The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability or unacceptability only and shall not be rated. Offerors must be determined to be responsible according to the standards of FAR Subpart 9 to be eligible for award. Award will be made to the acceptable Offeror with the lowest evaluated price, inclusive of options, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and the proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications and all other requirements of this solicitation. The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, the initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussion if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. Offerors are advised that unrealistically low price, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand this requirement, or has made an incautious proposal. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability or unacceptability only and shall not be rated. Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the nonprice factors. Any Offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have an acceptable or neutral past performance will then have the proposal evaluated for lowest price. The following non-price factors shall be used to determine acceptability of a proposal: Factor 1: Technical Capability Subfactor a: Technical Approach Subfactor b: Phase-In Plan Subfactor c: Section 508 Compliance Requirements Factor 2: Management Capability Subfactor a: Management Plan Subfactor b: Staffing Plan Factor 3: Quality Control Plan Factor 4: Past Performance Record Factors 1 through 4 shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), Past Performance Evaluation). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."

PAGE 54 OF 71 PAGES

To be considered acceptable and eligible for award, an Offeror must address separately all the factors set forth in accordance with the instructions of this solicitation. A major item and/or gross omission which precludes meeting solicitation objectives which cannot be corrected prior to or during discussions without major revision or complete resubmission of the proposal will cause a proposal to be found technically unacceptable. Proposals evaluated as "Unacceptable" on Factor 1, 2, or 3 will be ineligible for award and, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, may be ineligible for inclusion in the competitive range. An initial proposal evaluation of "Unacceptable" in the Past Performance Factor (Factor 4) will not automatically eliminate an Offeror from the competitive range, but may be considered in making the competitive range determination if communications have been conducted pursuant to FAR 15.306(b)(1)(i). Communications shall be held with Offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor keeping them from being placed within the competitive range if the communications are necessary to allow them to address adverse past performance information to which the Offeror(s) had not had a prior opportunity to respond. It is the intention of the Government to award without discussions. However, if it is determined that discussions are required, then the determination of the competitive range will include all proposals which are considered to be technically acceptable and may include those that are considered to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award, unless the competitive range is further limited in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2). Those Offerors whose proposals do not fall into the competitive range will be notified as required by FAR 15.503(a)(1). Offerors will be notified in writing with a concise explanation of their proposal deficiencies without jeopardizing the competitive range. Those Offerors whose proposals are determined by the Contracting Officer (KO) to be in the competitive range will be contacted by the Contract Specialist for discussions. Discussions will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306(d). If verbal discussions are held they will be followed by a written reiteration of the discussion. Written discussions may also be held, whereby the Government will provide a written list of discussion questions to each Offeror, as appropriate. In the case of both verbal and written discussions, the Offeror will provide a written response to the discussion question and revision to the proposal as required. This response and revision (if required) will be marked accordingly to distinguish it as a supplement to their original proposal. More than one round of discussions may be held. At the conclusion of final discussions, the Government will request each Offeror in the competitive range to submit a Final Proposal Revision (FPR). The FPR will be evaluated as to its revised technical, past performance, and/or pricing approach in response to the issues identified during discussions. The Government then intends, in accordance with the evaluation factors for award set forth below, to award a contract to the Offeror who has submitted the lowest price technically acceptable proposal. A proposal will be determined ineligible for award if Factor 1, Factor 2, Factor 3, or Factor 4 is/are evaluated as "Unacceptable". Factor 1: Technical Capability The Technical Capability Factor has two (2) subfactors: Technical Approach and Phase-In Plan. Both subfactors will be evaluated. The entire factor will be considered unacceptable if any of the subfactors are determined unacceptable. Based on this evaluation, the Factor will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. Subfactor A: Technical Approach The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine if the Offeror has an acceptable Technical Approach. To be determined acceptable, the Offeror must demonstrate a complete understanding of the PWS requirements and their ability to perform all performance tasks and objectives. Subfactor B: In-Phase Plan The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine if the Offeror has an acceptable Phase-In Plan. To be acceptable, the Offeror's Phase-In Plan must demonstrate an approach that seamlessly phases in all functional activities within the timeframe allotted. Subfactor C: Section 508 Compliance Requirements Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. EIT Information Content delivered as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. EIT delivered must include a completed GPAT or VPAT, a GPAT for DDPW IT Support Services is included as a part of this solicitation.

Factor 2: Management Capability The Management Capability Factor has two (2) subfactors: Management Plan and Staffing Plan. Both subfactors will be evaluated. The entire factor will be considered unacceptable if any of the subfactors are determined unacceptable. Based on this evaluation, the Factor will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. Subfactor A: Management Plan The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine if the Offeror has an acceptable Management Plan. To be determined acceptable, the Offeror's Management Plan must reflect a clear understanding of the work required and a reasonable, well-thought-out approach that is likely to yield the required results within the required time frame. This includes: an effective overall management methodology to manage the requirements of the PWS and an effective approach to resolve priority conflicts for the resources to ensure that the requirements of the PWS are met. Subfactor B: Staffing Plan The Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine if the Offeror has an acceptable Staffing Plan. To be determined acceptable, the Offeror's Staffing Plan must demonstrate a complete understanding of the work required and a reasonable, well-thought-out approach that is likely to yield the required results within the required time frame. This includes: an effective use of personnel to perform the services and an effective approach to fulfill the staffing requirements of the PWS. Factor 3: Quality Control Plan The entire factor will be considered unacceptable if the Quality Control Plan is determined unacceptable. Based on this evaluation, the Factor will be rated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. The Offeror's approach to Quality Control will be evaluated to determine if the approach is acceptable. To be acceptable, the Quality Control Plan must provide assurance that quality and timeliness will be achieved. Factor 4: Past Performance The Government may utilize the Federal Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), data submitted by the Offeror as part of the Past Performance Proposal, and any other information available to determine the quality and relevance of the Offeror's past performance. Each proposal will be evaluated to the extent to which the Offeror has demonstrated an ability and willingness to perform: 1) A quality product or service (i.e. the conformance to contract requirements, specifications, and standards of good workmanship); 2) Timeliness of the contract with regard to completion of contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules and administrative requirements (e.g., effort that contributes to or affects the schedule variance); 3) Acceptable cost control with regard to the Offeror's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost; 4) Good business relationships with regard to the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification and resolution, Offeror's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts, and whether the contractor met their small/small disadvantaged and women owned business participation goals; and 5) Management of personnel with regard to demonstration of a commitment to the management of personnel with regard to the Offeror's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing when necessary, personnel. The Government will only consider relevant past performance data of the Offeror and its major subcontractors. A major subcontractor is defined as those providing twenty percent (20%) of total dollar threshold AND/OR twenty-five percent (25%) of total man-hour effort. Subcontractors not meeting the definition of a "major subcontractor" will not be evaluated. To be considered relevant, the Offeror must demonstrate past execution of similar contracts in terms of complexity, technology, magnitude of effort, schedule, and scope. Additionally, the performance must have occurred during the last five (5) years. Offerors shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), Past Performance Evaluation). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable". Should the Government discover adverse past performance information to which the Offeror(s) had not had a prior opportunity to respond, the Contracting Officer will conduct communications if deemed appropriate.

If there is an unacceptable rating on any one of the non-price factors this will result in the offer being determined unacceptable. PRICE PROPOSAL If a proposal has been determined acceptable under each of the non-price factors listed above, the Government will then evaluate the proposal for the lowest price. The Government will perform a price analysis to determine the reasonableness of proposed price in accordance with FAR 15.4041(B)(2). The Government will utilize a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally, adequate price competition establishes price reasonableness (see FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)). In addition the Government will utilize a comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items, if both the validity of the comparison and the reasonableness of the previous price(s) can be established. The proposed price between offers that are determined to be technically acceptable will be the determining factor in the selection of a quotation for award.

REFERENCE NO. OF DOCUMENT BEING CONTINUED: SP3300-14-R-0010

PAGE 65 OF 71 PAGES

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Present/Past Performance Questionnaire ATTACHMENT 3 to REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) SP3300-14-R-0010 PART I ­ BACKGROUND The RFP has been issued to solicit offers that would provide the best value to the Government for contracted IT support services for on-site hardware, software, and technical support, IT support services are required to augment existing Government IT support personnel. The specific RFP requirements may be referenced at www.fbo.gov. The place of performance for contract start-up is DLA Information Operations, New Cumberland, PA located at Puget Sound, WA. A company that is interested in providing an offer on the RFP has requested that your firm complete this present/past performance questionnaire and submit it to the following: RETURN INFORMATION Email completed questionnaire to the acquisition specialist: Noemi.Edwards@dla.mil. All questionnaires shall be sent to the acquisition specialist by the proposal due date and time. PART II ­ QUESTIONNAIRE INSTRUCTIONS This questionnaire covers the topics that are in line with the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). This questionnaire is designed to provide basic information regarding the Contractor's present/past performance results on the contracts they have been awarded with your company and your satisfaction with their performance. RATERS PLEASE NOTE: Per DOD policy, a fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractors will not be assessed a lower than Satisfactory rating solely for not performing beyond the requirement of the contract. Please use the following guide in preparing your response to the below questions: Exceptional Definition: Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. Note: To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were of benefit to the Government. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it alone constitutes an Exceptional rating. Also there should have been NO significant weaknesses identified. Very Good Definition: Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor was effective. Note: To justify a Very Good rating, identify a significant event and state how it was a benefit to the Government. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified.

SP3300-14-R-0010 Attachment 4 10 December 2013 (WHEN COMPLETED) FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION ­ SEE FAR 2.101 and 3.104

Satisfactory Definition: Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear to be or were satisfactory. Note: To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor recovered from without impact to the contract. There should have been NO significant weaknesses identified. Marginal Definition: Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. Note: To justify Marginal performance, identify a significant event in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government. A Marginal rating should be supported by referencing the management tool that notified the contractor of the contractual deficiency (e.g., management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency report or letter). Unsatisfactory Definition: Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective. Note: To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government. A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the management tools used to notify the contractor of the contractual deficiencies (e.g., management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency reports, or letters). Not Applicable Definition: Did not apply to this acquisition; or, questionnaire respondent has no knowledge of, and/or did not observe, the contractor's performance in this area.
