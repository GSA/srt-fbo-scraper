  (d) All Contractor personnel performing under this contract and Contractor equipment used to process or store DOC data, or to connect to DOC networks, must comply with the requirements contained in the DOC Information Technology Management Handbook (http://www.osec.doc.gov/cio/cio_it_policy_page.htm), or equivalent/more specific agency or bureau guidance as specified immediately hereafter: __________

Failure to submit and receive  approval of the Certification Work Plan may result in termination of the  contract. 

    (2) Upon approval, the Contractor shall follow the work plan schedule to complete system certification activities in accordance with DOC IT Security Program Policy section 6.2, and provide the COR with the completed System Security Plan and Certification Documentation Package portions of the System Accreditation Package for approval and system accreditation by an appointed DOC official.

    (3) Upon receipt of the Security Assessment Report and Authorizing Official's written accreditation decision from the COR, the Contractor shall maintain the approved level of system security as documented in the Security Accreditation Package, and assist the COR in annual assessments of control effectiveness in accordance with DOC IT Security Program Policy, section 6.3.1.2.
