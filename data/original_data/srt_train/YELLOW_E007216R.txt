Effective immediately, the Department of Justice, (DOJ) Residency Requirement is amended to apply to all DOJ contractors employed within the United States, both United States citizens and non-United States citizens. The Residency Requirement has been in effect for employees for a number of years. However, as a result of the events of September 11 and the enhanced security posture within the Department, a determination has been made to apply it to contractors. This requirement is not retroactive. The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior ro applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas. This requirement can be waived for short-term (those contractors performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) contractors if there is a critical need for their specialized and unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages). These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. A waiver request from the Head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite contractor clearance security package should be submitted to the Department Security Officer for approval. Each waiver request will be reviewed and a determination made on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, an individual, whether employee or contractor, who is not a United States citizen must be from a country allied with the United States. Since the countries on the allied countries list are subject to change, please refer to the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm.

H.12 Warranties Warranty terms must be returned with the proposal. Conditions of an extended warranty will be considered by the Bureau. H.13 Notice to Prospective Contractors Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. Section 794d), requires Federal agencies to procure, use, maintain, and develop accessible electronic and information technology, unless doing so imposes an undue burden. Nation security systems are exempt. Federal agencies were required to comply with standards promulgated by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) that took effect on August 7,2000. Agencies must biannually evaluate their compliance with Section 508 and must report the results of these self-evaluations to the Attorney General. H.14 CONSENT FOR WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WORKPLACES All cleared personnel accessing information within FBI controlled space are required to execute an FBI Form FD-1001, "Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces," as a condition of working at FBI facilities. The Director, FBI, implemented the Attorney General's policy subjecting employees to warrantless physical searches of their offices or immediate workplaces within DOJ premises when authorized by the Attorney General (AG) or the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) based upon a determination that: 1. information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee is, or may be, disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner; 2. information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee has incurred excessive indebtedness or has acquired a level of affluence that cannot be reasonably explained by other information. 3. information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that is believed to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or 4. information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee has repeatedly or significantly mishandled or improperly stored classified information. The search may extend to the entire office or workplace and anything within it that might hold classified information, including locked containers (such as briefcases) and electronic storage media (such as computer disk and handheld computers), whether owned by the government, by the employee, or by a third party. The search may be conducted by appropriate FBI personnel and/or law enforcement officers, on an announced or unannounced basis, during the workday or after hours. If discovered during a search, evidence of misconduct - whether related to storage or classified information, storage of sensitive but unclassified information, or a crime - will be collected and reported to appropriate authorities. Contractor personnel who will meet the above criteria will be required to sign Form FD-1001, "Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces," (see attached) upon award and forward the executed form(s) to the assigned Contracting Officer's Technical Representative designated in Section G. All forms will be retained by the FBI during the period the individual is providing services and two years after that individual's departure before final disposition is taken. (End of clause)

Access to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Locations

Performance under this contract may require access to FBI locations to provide some service, product, or perform some other official function of interest to the FBI. Requirements, as identified below, to include approval by the FBI's Security Division, must be satisfied prior to access. Contractors who will require escorted access, to include short-term, intermittent, or infrequent access, to an FBI facility must complete an "Access of Non-FBI Personnel to FBI Facilities, Background Data Information Form," (FD 816), a "Privacy Act of 1974 Acknowledgment Form" (FD 484) and two Fingerprint Cards (FD 258). Completed forms should be provided to the assigned Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) at least 10 days prior to required access. Individuals requiring unescorted access to an FBI facility must complete the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions, using the Office of Personnel Management's Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) and provide two Fingerprint Cards (FD 258). e-QIP is a secure website that can be accessed from any computer system which has an Internet connection. Only the signed release forms and FD 258 will need to be mailed to the identified Chief Security Officer, the SF-86 itself will be transmitted to the FBI electronically. To complete the SF-86 using e-QIP, the individual requiring unescorted access to the FBI facility must contact (insert Chief Security Officer, Division, and telephone number) in order to be initiated into e-QIP. Once this action has been accomplished, the individual should be able to access e-QIP at the following link in order to initiate and complete the electronic process: http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/browsercheck.asp. Thoroughly read and follow the instructions for completing the SF-86. NOTE: To fully address suitability/security issues, the FBI requires individuals to provide responses to questions on the SF-86 for the last ten years. Failure to complete the application as instructed may lead to significant delays in processing the required investigation and approval for unescorted access. Upon logging onto e-QIP, there will be a prompt to answer three "Golden" security questions to establish the user account. After completing the electronic SF-86, please print and sign the (1) Certification Form (CER) - Certify Completeness and Accuracy of your Investigation Request; (2) Medical Release Form (MEL) - Authorization for Release of Medical Information; and (3) Release Form (REL) Authorization for Release of Information. In addition to these SF 86 release forms, the completion of a Non-Personnel Consent to Release Information (FD-979a), the United States Department of Justice Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Comsumer Reports (DOJ 555) are required. Annotation of the assigned e-QIP Investigation Request Number on the upper right corner of each document transmitted to the identified Chief Security Officer is required for coordination with the electronic transmission and to facilitate the investigative process. The e-QIP Investigation Request Number, automatically generated by e-QIP, is located on both the header and footer of the signature forms. These release forms (five total) and FD 258 should be mailed via Federal Express or UPS Express mail directly

(End of Certificate) K.5 REQUIREMENTS FOR PROCUREMENT OF CRITICAL ASSETS Every effort must be made to ensure that supplies are provided and integrated and services are performed using sound security components, practices, and procedures. Acquisition of supplies or services from concerns under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) or of supplies developed, manufactured, maintained, or modified by concerns under FOCI (any or all of which shall be referred to herein as "Use of FOCI source") is of serious concern and must be approved prior to contract award. Approval decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after the source or technology has been identified by the Offeror and subjected to a risk assessment.

33

E007216R

RFP

The risk assessment process will vary depending on the acquisition type and proposed use of a FOCI source, available risk mitigation measures, and the information/justification provided by the Offeror. Any Offeror responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Sealed Bid acknowledges the Government's requirements to secure services or equipment from firms which are not under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI), or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on National Security or security requirements. The Offeror understands and agrees that the Government retains the right to reject any response to this RFP, RFQ, or Sealed Bid made by the Offeror, without any further recourse by or explanation to the Offeror, if the FOCI for that Offeror is determined by the Government to be an unacceptable security risk. Risk assessments will be on a case-by-case basis and will be used to determine whether the use of a FOCI source poses an unacceptable security risk. If an unacceptable security risk is determined, the Government retains the right to reject the use of a FOCI source or to require that certain risk mitigation measures be taken by the Offeror. Similarly, the Government retains the unilateral right to approve the use of a FOCI source when the risk assessment indicates that such use would be in the Government's best interests. If the use of a FOCI source is not approved, no classified information will be disclosed to the Offeror as part of the Government's rationale for non-approval. The Offeror (prime and subcontractors) may not seek reimbursement from the Government for any costs associated with responding to this RFP, RFQ, or Sealed Bid, as a result of a FOCI non-approval decision. In Section K, Offerors shall complete the Acquisition Risk Questions and Key Management Personnel Listing (KMPL) for the prime contractor and all proposed subcontractors. Provision of false information shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract. The Government reserves the right to prohibit individuals who are not U.S. citizens from all or certain aspects of the work to be performed under this Contract. Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) - For purposes of this clause, a U.S. company is considered under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company's securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company. Changed conditions, such as change in ownership, indebtedness, or the foreign intelligence threat, may justify certain adjustments to the security terms under which a company is operating, or, alternatively, that different FOCI mitigation measures be employed. If a changed condition is of sufficient significance, it might also result in a determination that a company is no longer considered to be under FOCI. There is a continuing obligation of the Selected Offeror to advise the Government of such changed conditions. Failure to abide by this obligation shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this Contract. Factors: The following factors will be used as the basis for making an acquisition risk determination. If the Offeror, or its proposed subcontractors, meet any of the following factors, they must identify themselves as a potential FOCI company and submit themselves for a Government acquisition risk evaluation and assessment: (1) Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of 5 percent or more of the Offeror's company's voting securities by a foreign person. (2) Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect of 25 percent or more of any class of the Offeror's company's non-voting securities by a foreign person.

(3) Management positions, such as directors, officers, or executive personnel of the Offeror's company held by non-U.S. citizens. (4) Foreign person power, direct or indirect, to control the election, appointment, or tenure of directors, officers, or executive personnel of the Offeror's company or other decisions or activities of the Offeror's company. (5) Contracts, agreements, understandings, or arrangements between the Offeror's company and a foreign person. (6) Loan arrangements between the Offeror's company and a foreign person if the Offeror's company's (the borrower) overall debt to equity ration is 40:60 or greater; or financial obligations that are subject to the ability of a foreign person to demand repayment. (7) Annual total revenues or net income in excess of 5 percent from a single foreign person or in excess of 30 percent from foreign persons in the aggregate. (8) Ten percent or more of any class of the Offeror's voting securities held in "nominee shares," in "street names," or in some other method that does not disclose the beneficial ownership of equitable title. (9) Interlocking directors with foreign persons and any officer or management official of the Offeror's company who is also employed by a foreign person. (10) Any other factor that indicates or demonstrates a capability on the part of foreign persons to control or influence the operations or management of the Offeror's company. (11) Ownership of 10 percent or more of any foreign interest. Every effort must be made to ensure that supplies are provided and integrated and services are performed using sound security components, practices, and procedures. Acquisition of supplies or services from concerns under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) or of supplies developed, manufactured, maintained, or modified by concerns under FOCI (any or all of which shall be referred to herein as "Use of FOCI source") is of serious concern and must be approved prior to contract award and evaluated during contract performance. Approval decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after the source or technology has been identified by the Offeror and subjected to a risk assessment. Any Offeror responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Sealed Bid acknowledges the Government's requirements to secure services or equipment from firms which are not an acquisition risk; are not under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI); or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on National Security or security requirements. The Offeror understands and agrees that the Government retains the right to reject any response to this RFP, RFQ, or Sealed Bid made by the Offeror, without any further recourse by or explanation to the Offeror, if the acquisition risk for that Offeror is determined by the Government to be an unacceptable security risk. The risk assessment process will vary depending on the acquisition type and proposed use of a FOCI source, available risk mitigation measures, and the information/justification provided by the Offeror.

RFP

Factor P-2: This factor assesses the Offeror's past performance to determine its ability to provide a quality product or service. The quality of the Offeror's past performance shall be evaluated on the basis of information contained in the Offeror's proposal and information that the Government obtains through reference checks or other means. Past perfomance evaluation shall assess the Offeror's record of providing high quality services of a similar nature in a manner that ensures maximal accuracy, throughput, cost effectiveness and overall client satisfaction. The assessment of this factor will be based on evaluation of the following components: Factor P-3: Timeliness of Performance. This component assesses the Offeror's ability to provide requested services in a timely manner (i.e., met interim milestones, reliable, responsible to technical direction, completed on time, including contract administration). Factor P-4: Cost Control. This component assesses the Offeror's ability to complete contracts within the established cost range (i.e., within budget, current accurate and complete billings). Factor P-5: Customer Satisfaction. This component assesses the Offeror's ability to satisfy the needs of the customer in all facets of operations (i.e., satisfaction of end users with the Contractor's service). Offerors will be notified of any adverse Past Performance information received. If the Offeror has previously had an opportunity to respond to the adverse action, a copy of that response will be requested. If the Offeror had not previously been afforded that opportunity, the FBI will then extend the opportunity to respond. A negative finding under any Past Performance Factor/Sub factor may result in an adverse rating. In evaluating this factor, the Government may assess Offeror supplied information, current government information and experience related to the Offeror, and information developed as a result of direct contact with current and previous users of the Offeror's services. BUSINESS PROPOSAL EVALUATION As stated in the solicitation, all non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are more important than price. The Offeror's business proposal will be evaluated with respect to the price projected over the life of the contract covered by the proposal. Offers shall be evaluated to assess the realism or reasonableness of the proposed pricing to determine if they are (1) realistic for the work being performed, (2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and (3) are consistent with the various elements of the Offeror's technical proposal. Cost evaluation may include reviewing overhead prices, general and administrative (G&A) costs, fees, and other cost elements that, when combined with profit, provide the overall price. M.3 Scoring Methodology Proposals will evaluated by use of a color-coded/adjectival and narrative system. This rating system will allow the Technical Evaluation Team to identify strengths, weaknesses and risks associated with each factor and sub factor identified in each Offeror's proposal.

DEFINITIONS The following definitions have been tailored for this procurement:


A "Significant Strength" means an outstanding or exceptional aspect of the Offeror's approach that appreciably exceeds the acceptable level of quality, and provides a useful capability that can be included in Task Order proposals. A "Strength" means a significant aspect of the Offeror's approach that exceeds the acceptable level of quality, and provides a useful capability that can be included in Task Order proposals. A "Weakness" is a flaw in the approach that increases risk of unsuccessful performance. A "Significant Weakness" is a flaw in the approach that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful performance. A "Deficiency" is a material failure of a proposal to meet the minimum acceptable level of performance or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increase the risk of unsuccessful performance to an unacceptable level. Assessment of Risk includes consideration of the possibility that an unwanted negative event may occur, and of the impact of the negative event on the work, if it occurs.



 





ADJECTIVAL RATINGS There will be four rating levels used by members of the Technical Evaluation Team and Contracting Officer in the evaluation of proposals: Blue, Green, Yellow and red. The intent of the rating system is to add objectivity to the evaluation process such that meaningful and consequential differences between the proposals are recognized, and insignificant differences are considered. For each evaluated area, the appropriate rating will be indicated on the Evaluation Worksheet Forms. In addition, to afford the Evaluation Team members greater ability to differentiate between the merits of different proposals, the Evaluation Worksheet Form will require the inclusion of narrative comments along with the rating for each evaluation area. These comments may be used during the Evaluation Team meetings and as part of the final report. The below standard narrative adjectival scoring system will be used and illustrates to what degree the Offeror's proposal meets the evaluation standards: Technical Evaluation Adjectival Rating


Blue: Exceptional. Evaluated that virtually no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the proposed effort. The Offeror's understanding of the project and soundness of approach are such that virtually no Government intervention is expected to be required in achieving the proposed level of performance. No clarification is needed, and there are no significant ambiguities in any rated area.

3 Introduction
The Department of Justice Law Enforcement Community (LEC) is undergoing a Spectrum Relocation which requires microwave transmission systems to occupy less bandwidth than the current equipment. The current analog microwave transmission systems shall be replaced with DVB-T Coded-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed (COFDM) digital systems under the requirements of this specification. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking for DVB-T Transmitters and Receiver/Decoders to support Surveillance Applications. Additional features and functions that enhance the operation and effectiveness of this equipment are desired. Size and power consumption are very important factors for the procurement of digital transmitters. Two types of transmitters are to be supplied: The Standard Transmitter allows either 200 mW or 20 mW outputs and is HD compatible. The Miniature Transmitter provides 20 mW output power and is not required to be HD compatible. Three types of receivers are to be supplied: The Basic Receiver is capable of 2-way diversity combining. The Standard Receiver is capable of 2-way diversity combining. The Enhanced Receiver is capable of a minimum of 4-way diversity combining and has improved spurious and adjacent channel rejection.

4 Transmitter/Encoder Compatibility Specifications
4.1 Transmission Characteristics Introduction
Digital Video Broadcast ­ Terrestrial (DVB-T) is a COFDM system that was specifically designed for audio/video (A/V) transmission in both urban and metropolitan terrestrial applications. DVB-T has been in use in Europe and many other countries around the world for many years providing effective transmission over both short and long distances in line-ofsight (LOS) and non-LOS environments. The FBI has chosen to standardize on DVB-T for all Digital Audio/Video/Data (A/V/D) Wireless Links, which is preferred for all transmission requirements. All Digital Transmitters provided under this specification shall operate in standard 2K DVB-T mode, at a minimum. Additional operating modes are allowed provided the transmitter can be switched back to standard 2K DVB-T operating mode via its local control panel. The Standard Transmitter meets all of the following specifications, including the High Definition mode. The Miniature Transmitter must provide Standard Definition, while a High Definition mode is highly desirable. The specifications that differ between the Standard and Miniature Transmitters are highlighted in gray.

4.2 Digital Transmission Characteristics
The Digital Transmitter shall provide the following characteristics, at a minimum.

4.2.1 Frequency Bands
Transmitters shall operate in at least one of the frequency bands provided below:
Band L-Band S-Band C-Band X-Band Freq Low (GHz) 1.755 2.2 4.4 8.1 Freq High (GHz) 1.85 2.4 5.0 8.5

Multi-band operation is preferred to single-band.

4.2.2 Frequency Step Size
Frequency Step Size shall be 1 MHz or less in all bands, providing integer multiples of 1 MHz tuning steps can be achieved.

13

FBI Wireless Surveillance ­ Transmitter & Receiver Requirements

4.2.3 Frequency Accuracy
The Transmitter output frequency shall be accurate to within ą10 parts per million (ppm) of the desired carrier frequency under all operating conditions.

4.2.4 Phase Noise

4.2.5 RF Output Performance
Transmitter output power, spectral occupancy, and modulation error ratio (MER) of the equipment under test (EUT) shall be measured concurrently. For each band of operation, the EUT RF output performance will be measured at three points across the band: low, middle, and high. The EUT will be tested at room temperature (25şC) and at both temperature extremes defined in 4.12 for a total of 9 tests per band of operation. During each test, the EUT shall meet or exceed the required output power while not violating the spectral mask or exceeding the MER limits described below.

4.2.5.1 Spectral Mask
The Transmitter shall meet the following spectral mask at full rated output power, across the frequency band of operation, and over the full environmental operating range of the EUT:

Tx Bandwidth (MHz): ą Offset From Center Frequency (MHz) ą ą ą

6 3.6 6.0 8.0 12.0

7 4.2 7.0 9.3 14.0

8 4.8 8.0 10.7 16.0

Rel Level (dBc) -28 -35 -45 -50

The out-of-band power will be measured relative to in-band power where both are measured using a 3 kHz resolution bandwidth and a 300 Hz video bandwidth.

4.2.5.2 Modulation Error Ratio
The Transmitter modulation error ratio will be measured according to ETSI TR 101 290 v1.2.1 Section 6.9.2. MER will be measured at full rated output power, across the frequency band of operation, and over the full environmental operating range of the EUT. The Standard Transmitter shall have an MER of at least 25 dB. 14

FBI Wireless Surveillance ­ Transmitter & Receiver Requirements

The Miniature Transmitter shall have an MER of at least 22 dB.

4.2.5.3 RF Output Power
RF output power shall be measured using an averaging power meter. All transmitters must meet the minimum and maximum required output power under all operating conditions without violating the spectral mask from 4.2.5.1 or the MER requirements from 4.2.5.2. The Standard Transmitter shall supply an integrated RF output power of 200 mW minimum, 300 mW maximum in high power mode across the frequency band and over the operating temperature range. The Standard Transmitter shall supply an integrated RF output power of 20 mW minimum, 40 mW maximum in low power mode across the frequency band and over the operating temperature range. The Miniature Transmitter shall supply an integrated RF output power of 20 mW minimum over the frequency band and temperature range.

4.2.6 RF Output Impedance
Output Impedance: The Transmitter shall deliver the required output power into a 50 ohm load with a VSWR up to 1.5:1.

4.2.7 RF Output Protection
The Transmitter shall not be damaged by an infinite VSWR at any phase angle at their RF output ports for an indefinite time.

4.2.8 Harmonics and Spurious Responses
Harmonic and Out-of-Band Spurious emissions shall be less than -25 dBm measured in any 1 MHz bandwidth in the frequency range of 10 MHz to 20 GHz. Harmonic and out-of-band emissions are emissions outside the spectral mask frequency limits defined in 4.2.54.2.5.1 (i.e. ą2xOBW [MHz]).

4.2.9 Modulation
All transmitters shall support DVB-T COFDM modulation in 2k mode as defined in ETSI EN 300744. Additional operating modes are allowed provided the transmitter can be switched back to standard 2K DVB-T operating mode via its local control panel. All combinations of the following options, as defined in ETSI EN 300744, shall be supported:

12 Attachment B: System Information Table Usage
12.1 SI Table Introduction
System Information (SI) tables are necessary to enable compatibility and interoperability between multiple vendors and commercial equipment (DVB-T freeview receivers). To display video and audio from a basic MPEG transport stream (as defined in ISO/IEC 13818-1), the MPEG transport stream must include the fundamental Program Specific Information (PSI) of Program Association Table (PAT) and Program Map Table (PMT or MAP). The minimum SI table usage includes both the Network Information (NIT) and Service Description (SDT) tables. Within the SDT, only the service descriptor is required. Within the NIT only the network name descriptor is required. Other possible fields such as terrestrial delivery system, service list and logical channel descriptor are not required within the NIT.

12.1.1 Service Description Table
The main purpose of the SDT is to provide the channel name that appears on the screen when a channel is selected. Most commercial receivers will display up to a 14 character channel name. The service description table is described in full detail by Table 5 in ETSI EN300468. An example SDT table suitable for use with a freeview receiver is tabulated below. Table 2 ­ SDT

12.1.2 Network Information Table
The purpose of the NIT is to convey information relating to the physical transmitter of the transport stream. The only essential field required in this table by the freeview receiver is the network name descriptor. One of the common descriptors used here is the logical channel descriptor that relates a program to a specific channel number on the receiver ­ however most freeview receivers are insensitive to this an simply allocates channel numbers as services are found.

FBI Wireless Surveillance ­ Transmitter & Receiver Requirements

14.1 Introduction
FBI Standard Ancillary Data Encapsulation provides an interoperable means of transporting ancillary data over an MPEG Transport Stream as defined in IEC/ISO 13818-1 [1]. Incoming serial data at the transmitter is packetized and multiplexed with the audio/video streams. The receiver demultiplexes the streams and converts the ancillary data back into asynchronous serial data at the same baud rate and in the same format used at the transmitter.

14.2 References

14.3 Physical Interface
At a minimum, the transmitter and receiver shall provide one RS-232 [2] physical interface. Additional ports or other serial interfaces such as RS-485 may be optionally provided in addition to the one RS-232 interface. Ancillary data is transported unidirectionally from the transmitter to the receiver at the baud rates and in the formats specified in 0 and 0 below.

14.3.1 Serial Baud Rates
The transmitter and receiver shall support the following serial baud rates: 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200. The serial baud rate shall be set by the user at the encoder/transmitter. The receiver/decoder shall automatically detect and use the serial baud rate selected at the encoder/transmitter.

14.3.2 Serial Data Formats
The transmitter and receiver shall support the following user-selectable serial formats: Data Width: 7 or 8 bits Parity: None, Even, or Odd The transmitter and receiver shall use 1 stop bit and no flow control. The serial data format shall be set by the user at the encoder/transmitter. The receiver/decoder shall automatically detect and use the serial data format selected at the encoder/transmitter.

14.4 Packetizing
Asynchronous serial data received by the encoder shall be packetized and multiplexed with the transport stream as described below. User data shall be transported in the order received (first in, first out) and with an end-to-end latency of less than 500 milliseconds (ms). User data packets received in error (transport_error_indicator = 1) shall be discarded. 55

FBI Wireless Surveillance ­ Transmitter & Receiver Requirements

14.5 Transport Stream
Ancillary data is inserted into ISO/IEC 13818-1 transport stream (TS) packets using a packetized elementary stream (PES) of type private_stream_2. The packet identifier (PID) shall be set by the user at the transmitter. Additional ancillary data channels shall be carried on separate user-defined PIDs. TS packets containing ancillary data PES packets shall carry payload only (no adaptation field). Each ancillary data PES packet is 178 bytes long and fills one TS packet. Ancillary PES packets do not span multiple TS packets.

14.6 Program Map Table
The user defined PID for each ancillary data stream shall be included in the program map table (PMT) and their stream_type shall be set to 0x06. Support for multiple ancillary data streams is optional.

14.7 Packet Structure
The structure of Ancillary Data TS packets (including the PES structure) is shown in Table 4.

CONSENT FOR WARRANTLESS SEARCHES OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WORKPLACES
An agreement between __________________________________________ and the Full Name (print) United States. 1. Intending to be legally bound, I enter into this agreement in consideration of my being granted access, or retaining access, to information or material classified under Executive Order 12958, "Classified National Security Information," or a successor order, referred to in this agreement as classified information. I understand and accept that, by granting me access to classified information, the United States Government is placing special confidence and trust in me. 2. I have received a security briefing concerning the protection and safeguarding of classified information, including the procedures for its protection when it is not in my immediate custody, and I understand these procedures. 3. I have been advised that negligent handling, misuse, or inadequate safeguarding of classified information could cause irreparable injury to the United States or be used to advantage by a foreign nation. 4. In consideration of being granted access to classified information, I hereby consent to warrantless physical searches of my office or workplace within the Department of Justice, and anything in my office or workplace that might hold classified information, including but not limited to locked containers (such as briefcases) and electronic storage or processing media (including laptop computers, disks, and portable electronic devices (PEDs), whether owned by the Government, by me, or by a third party. 5. I understand that the searches described in paragraph 4 are for the purpose of determining whether classified information in my custody is being safeguarded in compliance with Department of Justice and Executive Branch security regulations and federal statutes, including prohibitions against unauthorized disclosure of classified information. I understand that the searches are for the purpose of ensuring compliance with these standards and to aid investigations into possible violations, including criminal violations. I understand that the searches may be conducted by Department security personnel and/or by law-enforcement agents, including agents of the FBI, and that information obtained from these searches may be used in disciplinary or criminal proceedings against me or others including proceedings unrelated to the safeguarding of classified information.

6. I also understand that this consent form will not be used as a basis for a search of my office or workplace unless the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General finds that one or more of the following conditions have been met: a. information the Department deems credible indicates that I am, or may be, disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner; b. information the Department deems credible indicates that I have incurred excessive indebtedness or have acquired a level of affluence that cannot reasonably be explained by other information; c. information the Department deems credible indicates that I had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that is believed to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or d. information the Department deems credible indicates that I have repeatedly or significantly mishandled or improperly stored classified information. I understand that the terms "foreign power" and "agent of a foreign power" have the meaning provided in 50 U.S.C. 1801, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I understand that the four conditions listed above are promulgated solely for the purpose of internal Department of Justice guidance. They are not intended to, do not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, that are enforceable at law by any party in any matter, civil or criminal, nor do they place any limitations on otherwise lawful investigative prerogatives of the Department of Justice. Thus, I understand that the finding underlying a search or seizure is not subject to challenge by me on any ground, including its factual correctness, with respect to any search or seizure conducted pursuant to this Agreement. However, I also understand that the finding of facts made by the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General in authorizing a search will not be used to establish the facts found for other purposes, such as a departmental proceeding concerning revocation or reinstatement of a security clearance. 7. I understand that all classified information to which I may obtain access by signing this Agreement is now and will remain the property of the United States Government. I agree that I will return all classified materials that may come into my possession or for which I am responsible because of such access upon demand by an authorized representative of the Department of Justice or upon the conclusion of my employment or other relationship with the Department of Justice. 8. Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Justice, I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed on me by this Agreement, including my consent to searches of my office or workplace within Department of Justice premises, apply during the time I am granted access to classified information, and for three years thereafter if I remain an employee of the Department of Justice.
