1. Introduction 1.1 OCC and Chief Counsel's Office 1.1.1 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises national banks to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system that supports both the citizens and the economy of the United States. The Comptroller is a presidential appointee and OCC's headquarters are in Washington, D.C. The OCC is divided into seven functional departments. Each of these departments is headed by a senior management official who reports directly to the Comptroller. While the organizations and staff of each of these departments interact, each department has its own mission and goals. The Chief Counsel's Office is one of these departments. 1.1.2 Chief Counsel's Office The Chief Counsel's Office is responsible for the management of the Licensing, Community Affairs and Law Departments, with staff counts of 70, 30 and 200, respectively. The staff members who support these departments are primarily located at the OCC Headquarters (HQ) building in Washington, DC and at each of the four OCC district offices. The four district offices are located in New York City (Northeastern District), Chicago (Central District), Dallas (Southern District), and Denver (Western District). Figure 0­1 provides a high-level view of the organizational structure.

Figure 0­1 CCO Organizational Structure 1.2 Current System for Project/Assignment Tracking CCO currently uses a project/assignment reporting tool called Project Tracking System (PTS),

CCO

which is a Lotus Notes based application. Assignments, such as requests for legal interpretations, licensing decisions and investigations, are entered into the system by assigned Lead(s) and staff. These individuals report significant events, explanations and progress on assignments and matters until completion. Reports are generated from Lotus Notes views and used for management and discussions within CCO. The First Senior Deputy Comptroller/Chief Counsel (FSDC/CC) also uses PTS reports to discuss project progress in regular meetings with her counterparts in the Large Bank Supervision and the Midsize/Community Bank Supervision departments. The system is also used to report compliance with internal timeframes for rendering external opinions. Concerns with the existing system include:  Limitations of the system's flexibility with respect to reports. For example, the existing system does not provide ad hoc reporting.  Limitations of the system's flexibility with respect to data entry. For example, the existing system does not auto-populate fields or provide the capability to pre-enter fields in templates to expedite data entry.  Lack of tailoring to reflect differences among the Licensing, Community Affairs (CA), and Legal user groups, within an overall consistent model.  Failure to meet legal requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.  The possibility that inaccurate or untimely project tracking could lead to missed deadlines, inaccurate reports, and diminished reputations for both the Headquarters OCC and CCO. 1.3 Purpose of Statement of Objectives and Related Documents The purpose of the AMS Request for Proposal (RFP), to which this Statement of Objectives (SOO) is an attachment, is to obtain services, software, and equipment to implement a solution for the Assignment Management System (AMS). Offerors shall submit price proposals based on firm fixed price. AMS will track the status of staff assignments, projects and matters for all three departments within CCO and will fully replace PTS. The SOO and its appendices contain the expectations for AMS and invites qualified solution providers 1 to propose and price a solution based on the overview provided in Section 0 of this SOO, the AMS Functional Requirements Document (FRD) (Appendix B) and the Supplementary Requirements Document (SRD) (Appendix C).

2. Objective of AMS The objective of AMS is to improve the quality, consistency and timeliness of matter, project and assignment information as it is used and reported across CCO, especially including all of the information needed by the FSDC/CC to manage the Law Department, the Licensing Department and the Community Affairs Department.

AMS Statement of Objectives

CCO

2.1 Overview of Requirements AMS will satisfy the following stakeholder needs:  Improve assignment reporting accuracy, timeliness, and flexibility  Make assignment data entry more efficient  Facilitate tailoring for departments within CCO while maintaining a consistent model  Achieve compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Details of AMS requirements are contained in the FRD and SRD. It is envisioned that AMS will use an architecture and design that will allow for future expansion and integration with other OCC systems. The key requirements for AMS are:  AMS will standardize project and assignment management to:   Allow CCO employees to standardize the process of entering, tracking, and updating their projects and assignments. Provide robust core functionality for defining projects/assignments, project types, people, assignments of people to projects/assignments including dates and duration of assignments, designation of specific roles (e.g. primary responsible vs. other roles) for people on specified assignments, and structured data for status flags in assignments. Support performance management capabilities to allow (or require) users to associate a level of effort as well as relative priority for assignments (e.g., three most important assignments).





AMS will standardize report generation to:    Allow CCO employees to report on the status of assignments, projects, and issues in real time. Allow CCO employees to create and run ad hoc reports. Allow users to have the ability to generate reports from multiple data sources, using a variety of standard formats, parameterized reports, linked reports, ad hoc reports, drill down reports, and sub reports.

 

AMS will allow data manipulation to:    Allow data to be presented and reported based on user, role, or department.

AMS will provide portal/user interface creation and customization to: Allow for the creation and customization of user portals based on appropriate role or group by division. Provide an interactive dashboard for listing and presenting assignments according to user-defined criteria, with drill-down capabilities for greater visibility into the details and history of high-priority and specially designated activities, allowing senior management greater visibility into all CCO resources and tasks. Include robust configuration capability to support screen design, field additions and field labeling without custom programming. 7 June 30, 2011 Version 1.2



OCC Information Technology Services

AMS Statement of Objectives 

CCO

Provide a robust configuration capability that preserves data structures and user interfaces common to all users while allowing for some group-specific configuration. Have the capability to produce audience-specific views of the same report, based on a number of configurable properties such as division and role.

 

AMS will provide support for CCO business processes to:  Utilize workflow, business process management or similar capabilities to improve communication and collaboration on assignments between CCO managers and their direct reports and across CCO departments. Have functionality to associate related assignments/projects and track assignment attributes over the life cycle of the assignment.

 

AMS will support Data Management to:  Provide data Capability to output AMS data and text to tools such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Additionally, capability to export data to other systems via Extensible Markup Language (XML). Provide a well organized data model that shows the relationship between parent and child data and which tables relate to specific system functions. Have a security model that allows for different levels of access to system data and functions based upon defined roles and access privileges. Have a modern application architecture and user interface design that is extensible via web services and XML-based data exchange and allows for Microsoft Office Integration (Excel, Outlook, etc.)

  



AMS will support IT standards to:  Comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Applicable provisions that apply to this requirement are the following:      36 CFR 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems 36 CFR 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications 36 CFR 1194.31 Functional performance criteria

Provide external e-mail SMTP alerts and notifications. Provide seamless integration with 3rd party systems and databases using standard based technology.

2.2 Possible Future Requirements CCO envisions that AMS will evolve over time, and should be designed to accommodate future enhancements for the following functions:  Interface to enable data entry efficiencies and integrated reporting from both AMS and CATS. (CATS is an Appian BPMS-based application used by the Licensing 8 June 30, 2011 Version 1.2

OCC Information Technology Services

AMS Statement of Objectives

CCO

Department within CCO in which assignments appear as tasks assigned to Licensing personnel.) (This has a high likelihood of being a near-term future requirement after the initial deployment of AMS.)  Document management capabilities or the ability to interface with a 3rd party document or records management system (e.g., Open Text). (This has a low likelihood of being a future requirement after the initial deployment of AMS.) A capability that allows CCO staff to record their time against a specific assignment or set of assignments. Individuals with the appropriate permissions would be able to run reports against this time tracking data and export this data to other systems as appropriate. (This has a low likelihood of being a future requirement after the initial deployment of AMS.)



While the above-described capabilities are not requirements for the initial deployment of AMS, it is important that the product or platform used for AMS be readily adaptable to permit addition of these capabilities in the future. Items described in this section concerning possible future integrations and capabilities are pertinent only in the sense that the OCC would like to understand how the initial deployment can be extended in the future to include such other capabilities. Offerors should provide price proposals as "Options" for items described this section. 2.3 Excluded Capabilities There are several areas of functionality commonly found in Law-oriented case and assignment management systems that are not required for AMS. Three of these are as follows:  Litigation case management functionality that applies in-depth electronic and other tools, including case-specific tagging and coding, to achieve intensive, deep analysis of document collections associated with an assignment. Timekeeping and billing functions of the type found in private law firms. Outside counsel cost management, and "legal spend" analysis functions of the type used by Law departments with large outside counsel cost budgets.

 

There are several areas of functionality commonly found in IT and engineering-oriented project management systems that are not required for AMS. Two of these are as follows:  Automated functions to compute and assign resources to projects/locations based on business rules (e.g., "auto-scheduling" or resource leveling functionality). In AMS, assignments will be made by people exercising professional judgment. Project management functions that highlight critical paths, milestones, risks, and issues. However, it is expected that in certain projects, tasks/events may need to be recorded as dependent or linked in a sensible fashion chronologically.



It would be acceptable to the OCC if the AMS were to be built on a COTS product that has any of the above features so long as (a) they can effectively be hidden so that they do not confuse users and (b) they do not add to the cost of AMS.

AMS Statement of Objectives AMS Project Concept

CCO

3.1 Overview The offeror shall provide the services necessary to develop and deploy AMS to meet the functional requirements and achieve CCO's business objectives. This includes such activities as project management, requirements validation, software architecture and design, software development, testing, implementation/deployment, legacy data, training, software and human change management, configuration management, monitoring and alerting, help desk/incident management, and organizational transition. It is expected that the degree to which some of these services will be provided will in part be a function of the type of underlying product or technology the offeror proposes. While we invite offerors to recommend a project approach that will ensure project success, we suggest that the offeror consider the advantages of the following:  Emphasis on iterative approach for design and development  Emphasis on check points and measures to ensure progress  Emphasis on written deliverables that directly support development, implementation and post-deployment support  Emphasis on platform configuration over original coding 3.2 Possible Project Phases Table 0­1 provides a suggested outline of project tasks including document deliverables, work products and system deliverables. The OCC Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) number in the table below matches those presented in Attachment G, the Project-Oriented WBS. 2 This table is not an exhaustive list of tasks that would be required to complete the project and their ordering is notional only. Offerors can propose their own approaches to phasing, schedule and deliverables, but the deliverables and work products in Table 3-1 are mandatory. Items marked as "document deliverables" will undergo the formal document review process described later in this SOO. Further guidance on the expected content of most document deliverables is available in the OCC's SDLC. Items are listed in illustrative phasing order assuming an iterative style development and are not expected to match to the OCC WBS IDs as a numerical sequence.

4. Performance Measures and Submission and Evaluation of Deliverables 4.1 Overview and Key Definitions The AMS project will be guided by performance objectives and appropriate quantitative measures. The specifics of these should be proposed by offerors, should address four broad classes, and should adhere to the framework and mechanisms detailed in this SOO (e.g. document scoring guidelines). The classes are: Work Product: Performance measures for work products. A work product is a document that requires OCC acceptance but not formal scoring in the manner of document deliverables and system deliverables. Document Deliverable: Performance measures for document deliverables. A document deliverable goes through a rigorous review process with formal assignment of scores per the quality assurance review process. System Deliverable: Performance measures for system deliverables. A system deliverable is a

release of a functioning iteration into a specified environment for formal review by OCC (i.e., Pilot Release and Production Release). Customer Satisfaction: One performance measure for overall Customer Satisfaction, to be assessed monthly, will be applied. Guidelines and suggestions for performance measures for these categories are contained in this SOO. After final negotiations and award, performance measures will be incorporated into the contract and made part of the OCC Quality Assurance Plan. Evaluations of work products, deliverables and customer satisfaction will be inputs to the overall evaluation of offeror performance. Additionally, depending on contract form and terms and conditions, evaluation of contractor performance could have monetary impacts, positive or negative. 4.2 Document Work Products and Deliverables Offerors must propose milestone dates for all mandatory deliverables and any other proposed deliverables. Work products and document deliverables will be evaluated for their timeliness and quality, but only document deliverables will receive formal scoring. Timeliness and quality measures are discussed in Section 7.5. 4.2.1 Performance Measures and Acceptance Criteria Table 0-1 describes the OCC's performance objectives for AMS in terms of schedule and quality. Appendix D, "Performance Measures and Acceptance Standards," explains in further detail how the OCC will evaluate the offeror's document deliverables. On a monthly basis, the COTR (Contracting Officer Technical Representative) will establish scores for these measures and these scores will become inputs to the overall evaluation of the offeror's performance. Table 0-1 AMS Performance Objectives Performance Objective On Schedule High Quality Description AMS deliverables will be delivered to the OCC in accordance with the baseline project schedule. AMS deliverables will meet or exceed the target quality level. Performance Measure Milestone Timeliness Deliverable Quality

4.2.2 Submission and Review Procedures For purposes of formal delivery, all deliverables shall be provided by email to the COTR, AMS Project Manager, the Contracting Officer (CO), and the Contract Administrator (CA). The COTR is responsible for inspection and acceptance of deliverables. This responsibility is delegated to the COTR by the Contracting Officer. The COTR has a minimum of five business days to inspect deliverables and provide comments. The offeror has three business days to respond to the COTR's comments by correcting the deliverable and resubmitting it. The COTR will assign a deliverable quality score to each deliverable. The COTR-assigned score will be used as input to the monthly deliverable quality performance, which in turn will be one factor in determining evaluations submitted to the federal Contract Performance Assessment and

Review System (CPARS). The COTR will collect feedback as appropriate from the pertinent stakeholders in arriving at scores. 4.2.3 The PMO Document Review Process The PMO document review process is one of the PMO's quality assurance processes. The process applies to document deliverables and is distinct from the COTR's inspection process, although the COTR generally considers the results of the PMO document review process in establishing scores. See Appendix E, The PMO Document Review Process, for greater detail. 4.3 System Deliverables Offerors must propose milestone dates for all mandatory system deliverables and any other proposed system deliverables. System deliverables will be evaluated on quality measures such as percent of requirements met for specific phases; the degree of absence of defects; system responsiveness, performance and uptime; and measures of user satisfaction. Listed in Table 0-2 are key system deliverables expected with this SOO. While it is not necessary for offerors to proposed detailed measures for all items individually, the measures proposed should be adequate to assess the degree of success obtained by the AMS project. It should be understood that some measures cannot be properly applied until the project is complete and the system is in live operation. Table 0-2 AMS Key System Deliverables System Deliverables Possible Measurement Ideas Functioning UI, Database, Interfaces, 25% of Functioning Pilot Reports--offeror to propose specific metrics, e.g. percent requirements met Response times; percent requirements met; customer satisfaction--offeror to propose specific metrics; Functioning Production System in live verification of correct transfer, mapping or environment transformation between source data and converted data per requirements. Section 508 Compliance in Production Meeting Section 508 standards System Data Conversion Execution produces expected Data Conversion to Production System results--offeror to propose specific metrics 4.4 Remediation of Unacceptable Deliverables The OCC will require the offeror to re-work and re-submit unacceptable deliverables. Unacceptable deliverables will also be considered late if they are incomplete or are of such poor quality that they cannot be counted as a good faith submission. Consistent with FAR 52.246-4, the offeror will correct deliverables produced under fixed-price tasks without additional cost to the OCC. Consistent with FAR 52.246-6, the offeror will correct deliverables produced under time-and-material or labor-hour tasks at a cost to the OCC that excludes offeror profit.

4.5 Customer Satisfaction During the course of the project, the COTR will collect input from stakeholders to arrive at a customer satisfaction rating for each month. This measure will seek to record the overall customer experience that OCC is having with the project. The score will be assessed on a 1-5 scale similar to document scoring (1=lowest, 5= highest rating).

5. Project Management 5.1 Key Personnel During the period of contract performance, the offeror shall not substitute key personnel unless the substitution is approved by the OCC in advance or necessitated by illness, death, termination of employment. The offeror shall notify the CO within one business day after the occurrence of any of these events and provide the information required in the paragraph below at least 15 calendar days prior to making any permanent substitutions. The offeror shall provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating any proposed substitution, resumes for the proposed substitutes, and any additional information requested by the CO. Proposed substitutes must possess qualifications comparable or superior to the original key person, as well as satisfying all minimum standards. The CO will notify the offeror within 15 calendar days after receipt of all required information of the decision regarding acceptability of substitutions. At minimum, the Project Manager, Test & Evaluation Lead and the Technical Lead will be designated as key personnel. 5.2 Project Manager The Project Manager will be responsible for the overall management and coordination of this contract and shall act as the central point of contact with the Government. The Project Manager shall have full authority to act on behalf of the offeror in the performance of the required services. The Project Manager shall meet with the COTR and CO as necessary to discuss problems as they occur and shall respond by email preferably on the same day of receiving notification of a problem but in any event no later than close of business on the succeeding business day. The Project Manager shall speak and write English fluently. 5.3 Project Management Activities The offeror will provide project management support including:  Developing and maintaining the WBS and project schedule for the tasks under this contract.  Directing offeror staff in accordance with the contract.  Preparing a weekly status report for the tasks under this contract. At a minimum, the weekly status report should include activities performed during the week, activities planned for the upcoming week, a discussion of any problems or issues, and any relevant contract financial information.

Ensuring work products and deliverables are prepared with high quality and submitted timely. Proactively addressing emerging issues and providing early warnings on items that could require management attention. Meeting regularly with CO and COTR to identify and resolve issues relating to scope, schedule or cost.

5.4 Information Risk Management Activities The offeror will support risk management activities related to the AMS project. The OCC's Information Risk Management (IRM) team is responsible for coordinating and executing Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)-related risk management activities, which include the development of the AMS system security plan, execution of the security test and evaluation (ST&E), and facilitation of certification and accreditation (C&A) activities. Under this task, the offeror will provide the following support:  Provide inputs for the AMS system security plan.  Provide inputs for certification and accreditation activities.  Provide inputs for memorandums of understanding (MOU) and interconnection security agreements (ISA) for AMS interfaces.  Respond to defects identified during the ST&E.  Provide inputs for the plan of actions and milestones. 5.5 Work Breakdown Structure and Earned Value Management Appendix G is a template that may be used as a guide to create a WBS and Appendix H is the associated WBS dictionary. The OCC uses the template to standardize the WBS for its projects. The offeror must submit a WBS that reflects the work it intends to perform organized into control accounts and work packages to which planned values are attached. OCC provides EVM reporting to its stakeholders. In order to do so, OCC requires inputs from the offeror at the end of each month in support of its monthly invoices. To adhere to OCC EVM requirements the offeror shall propose a project WBS including planned values at the control account level. The control account level is expected to be equivalent to the "Task Level" in the structure shown below. At project inception, the proposed planned values and WBS will be adjusted along with the schedule in accordance with the contract scope and period of performance to reach an agreed baseline for cost and schedule performance. 1.0 Project - Highest level in WBS 1.1 Phase - Level 2 in WBS

1.1.1 Task ­ Level 3 in WBS. For purposes of the AMS project, the task level is the equivalent of a control account. 1.1.1.1 Activity ­ Level 4 in WBS. For purposes of the AMS project, the activity level is the equivalent of a work package. Offerors should prepare the WBS so that the project is spread over a reasonable number of control accounts (e.g., 12-15). The phasing structure shown in the "AMS Project Concept" (Section 3) is an approximate guide, but note that this guide does not distinguish between Task and Activity for the purpose of calling out Tasks as Control Accounts. The MS Project WBS template provides the EVM value accrual methodology for each of the applicable deliverables. The offeror's project schedule / plan shall contain the following for all activities: Baseline Start, Baseline Finish, Baseline Cost, Actual Start, Actual Finish, and Percent Complete. 5.6 Required Tools and Procedures The following sub-sections identify the standard tools that OCC requires the integrator to use for the AMS project. OCC will provide the necessary software licenses and other resources for the project team. 5.6.1 Requirements Management The OCC has standardized on the Rational Tool Suite version 7.0.1, including Rational RequisitePro (with the exception of Rational Performance Tester which has been upgraded to version 8.2). The OCC has documented the requirements set in Rational RequisitePro and the offeror is expected to support this requirement. 5.6.2 Test Management The OCC intends to use the Rational Suite tools below to manage standard defect tracking and testing.  Rational Performance Tester ­ Determine application performance under load and stress conditions based on established benchmarks and/or performance requirements.  Rational Manual Tester ­ Plan and develop test scripts based on requirements.  Rational Functional Tester ­ Automate test scripts where applicable for stable applications.  Rational Clear Quest/Test Manager ­ Manage test scripts created in Rational Manual Tester/Functional Tester during test planning, report test results of executed test scripts, and manage the life cycle of any reported issues. 5.6.3 Document Management The selected offeror will use OCC Open Text and the AMS SharePoint site for the AMS project. Formal deliverables are to be submitted via Open Text. Other files and work products will be stored in AMS SharePoint site. 5.6.4 Document Formatting and Style Guide OCC Information Technology Services 22 June 30, 2011 Version 1.2

AMS Statement of Objectives

CCO

The offeror shall follow the PMO document formatting and style guide (Appendix F) for all formal deliverables. 5.6.5 OCC Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC 3.1.1) The OCC's Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Manual version 3.1.1 provides guidance to the information needed for specific deliverables. While the SDLC follows a more traditional waterfall approach, the OCC views the AMS project as being more iterative in nature and has indicated in Section 0 a phasing approach to be considered and as such not all SDLC deliverables in SDLC 3.1.1 are needed for this project.

6. Technical Considerations and Constraints 6.1 OCC Software Environment Table 0­1 provides the current OCC standard software configuration and Table 0­2 provides the current OCC standard server configuration. The offeror should consider this information when developing their proposal. The proposed AMS solution should not be constrained by the current OCC software environment; however, when evaluating the offeror's proposal, the OCC will consider operational impacts resulting from the proposed solution.

solution. Although the OCC will consider all appropriate solutions whether or not they leverage some pre-existing component in the OCC software environment, other things being equal it will make sense for the OCC to make use of its prior investments.  Appian Business Process Management System­ Appian is being implemented for two projects that require workflow or tracking of critical business processes and enhanced reporting functionality and is currently available to all OCC employees and contractors. Consequently, an offeror may propose a solution built on Appian BPMS or leveraging Appian BPMS as some component of a solution, possibly through an add-on, pull-in, or some other means.  Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 ­ MOSS 2007 is implemented and currently available to all OCC employees and contractors. Consequently, an offeror may propose a solution built on SharePoint or leveraging SharePoint as some component of a solution, possibly through an add-on, pull-in, or some other means. In addition MS InfoPath 2003 is available and may also be leveraged as appropriate. OpenText eDocs DM/RM (formerly Hummingbird) v6.0.5x ­ While document management and records management functionality is not part of the initial release of AMS, OpenText eDocs DM/RM v6.0.5x is implemented at the OCC and potentially available to all OCC employees and contractors. Should the OCC desire to add DM and/or RM capabilities to AMS, an interface with OpenText will be the preferred approach. 6



6.3 Infrastructure Management The offeror will follow rigorous configuration management practices spanning the software and infrastructure environments required to advance system builds from development, to testing, and to production. Offeror responsibilities in regard to each environment will be clarified at project inception. Table 0­3 broadly outlines the role of the OCC and the offeror in infrastructure support.

Activities identified as an OCC responsibility may be performed by government personnel or supporting contractor personnel. Joint activities will be performed by the AMS offeror and OCC. 6.4 Privacy OCC does not consider AMS to be a Privacy Act System. It will, however, contain personally identifiable information and other sensitive but unclassified data. Accordingly, the system design will need to account for confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the data stored therein. 6.5 Section 508 - IT Accessibility This section addresses requirements related to section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the federal mandate stating that "Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities. The system user interface shall be subject to specific functional performance criteria related to section 508 requirements and shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user vision, user hearing, user speech, fine motor control, or support for assistive technology used by people who are visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing, or other disabilities. To be considered for award, offerors must propose goods and/or services that meet the applicable provisions and provide OCC with documentation showing these requirements have been met, as follows:  36 CFR 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems. OCC has determined that this applies to all EIT software applications and operating systems procured or developed under this work statement including but not limited to developed, GOTS and COTS software. In addition, this standard applies to Web-based applications when technical approaches are used that fail to meet the functional performance criteria defined in 1194.31.  36 CFR 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications. Applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (nonstatic) interface, embeds custom user control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) then "1194.21 Software" and "1194.24 Video and Multimedia" standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.

36 CFR 1194.31 Functional performance criteria. Applies to all EIT deliverables regardless of delivery method. All EIT deliverables shall use technical standards interchangeably, regardless of technology, to fulfill the functional performance criteria.

7. Guidance to Offerors on Proposals Detailed instructions to offerors are contained in the RFP, to which this SOO is an attachment. Some broad guidance is provided below. 7.1 Software Product Platform While offerors are free to propose any software product platform, OCC's strategic orientation is not to add new technologies to its infrastructure unnecessarily if existing software tools and components are well suited to a new system. The offeror shall provide the OCC with the option to purchase the software for the AMS project. There will be approximately 300 OCC users of AMS. The OCC is open to alternative licensing approaches, including the reuse of appropriate existing licenses for software already owned by OCC. 7 7.2 Implementation Approach This SOO provides an AMS project concept featuring iterative design and development as a possible approach. While offerors are free to propose any implementation approach, offerors are encouraged to explain in their proposals the reasons for not using an iterative design and development approach if they propose some other technique. Also, it is assumed that a large portion of what is referred to here as "development" will actually be "configuration" within the product platform and not original coding. The OCC envisions that the implementation timeframe for the AMS project would be approximately nine months from contract award to full, live deployment. However, this is just a guideline and offerors are free to propose a longer or shorter schedule. 7.3 OCC Data Center vs. "Cloud" While offerors are free to propose a Software-as-a-Service solution operating in a cloud outside of the OCC data center, offerors who do propose this approach should be especially clear on the details of how this would work including how future potential integrations with other OCC systems would operate successfully, securely and with good performance and reliability. 7.4 Hardware The offeror shall provide the OCC with the option to purchase the suggested hardware for the AMS project. Offerors should provide detailed justifications for the quantity and type of hardware proposed. It is possible that the hardware required for AMS is already owned by the

OCC or will be acquired separately. Therefore, the offeror shall propose hardware as an optional item. 7.5 Review Time and Level of Effort Considerations for Deliverables The offeror should propose the due date for the management review version of each deliverable. Due dates for subsequent versions are relative to when the OCC provides comments on its predecessor version. For example, the quality assurance review version of a deliverable is due five business days after the OCC provides comments on the management review version. When estimating the level of effort for a given deliverable, offerors should take into consideration the quality assurance process described in the SOO and allow the necessary time for incorporating edits from the reviewers. In developing their LOEs, the offerors should assume the following that all OCC reviewers will provide their review comments in electronic form (via the Microsoft [MS] Word "Insert Comment" and/or "Track Changes" features). In addition, the OCC will deliver to the solution provider a single spreadsheet of consolidated comments so the offeror team has a single source document that summarizes all reviewers' feedback. This spreadsheet, plus the individual electronic files from the reviewers reflecting their edits, will be provided to the offeror project team at the end of each review cycle to facilitate the incorporation of the feedback from OCC staff.

If the performance-based finance payments are on a whole contract basis, liquidation shall be by either predesignated liquidation amounts or a liquidation percentage. (2) If at any time the amount of payments under this contract exceeds any limitation in this contract, the Contractor shall repay to the Government the excess.

If approved, the basis for payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. (6) When the Contractor completes all of the obligations under this contract, including liquidation of all performance-based payments, title shall vest in the Contractor for all property (or the proceeds thereof) not-- (i) Delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract; or (ii) Incorporated in supplies delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract and to which title is vested in the Government under this clause.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998) This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. The full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://acquisition.gov FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 1) PROVISIONS NUMBER 52.217-5 DATE JUL 1990 TITLE EVALUATION OF OPTIONS

M.2

BASIS FOR AWARD

The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below. The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1, permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal. To be responsive the offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. The offeror must state how it will meet the requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP or responding with product sales literature is not acceptable. The failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition. The Government intends to award a single contract. However, no award will be made that is not in the best interest of the Government simply to provide coverage in task areas. M.3 EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THE BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represent the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. The offeror's proposal shall be in the form prescribed by, and shall contain a response to each of the

57

CHIEF COUNSEL'S OFFICE (CCO) ASSIGNMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AMS)

CC12HQR0004

areas identified in the Section J solicitation provisions. Factor 1 is more important than all other factors. (2) The technical evaluation factors for the initial evaluation prior to competitive range determination are listed below in descending order of importance: Factor 1 ­ Technical and Management Approach Factor 2 ­ Past Performance Factor 3 ­ Price / Cost (3) The technical evaluation factors after the establishment of the competitive range are listed below in descending order of importance: Factor 1 ­ Technical and Management Approach Factor 2 ­ Past Performance Factor 3 ­ Demonstration/Presentation Factor 4 ­ Price / Cost Offerors in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to conduct an oral presentation/demo to the Program Office. The Contract Specialist shall give each offeror in the competitive range an opportunity to give a 45 minute presentation. Evaluation of Proposals The Government will evaluate the Offerors' Technical Capability using five qualitative rating definitions (Exceptional, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, or Unsatisfactory). The Past Experience/Past Performance portion of the proposal shall be assessed for performance risk using six definitions (very low, low, moderate, high, very high, or unknown). Under Past Performance, performance risk assessments of past performance will help predict how a contractor will perform based on contract performance on requirements of similar type, size, and complexity. An offeror without any past performance will receive a neutral rating. Factor 1: Technical and Management Approach The Government will evaluate the Offeror's Performance Work Statement for:  Ability to effectively and efficiently accomplish, administer, staff and manage the day to day operations through the efficient use of resources, processes, techniques, and tools to ensure successful completion of all tasks required under the contract.  Approach to ensure that the Government achieves the established objectives of the project.  Approach to managing project organization, performance monitoring and control activities, contract performance, subcontractors and/or teaming arrangements, task order management, and ensuring clear distinct lines of communication and decision making authority are reflected across the program team.

58

CHIEF COUNSEL'S OFFICE (CCO) ASSIGNMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AMS)

CC12HQR0004

The following components will also be evaluated as part of this factor:  Performance Measures ­ The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed performance measures and their appropriateness.  Key Personnel ­ The Government will evaluate the Offeror's selection of key personnel positions and the relative role of these positions within the program.  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan ­ The Government will evaluate the Offeror's QASP.  IT Accessibility (Section 508) ­ The Government will evaluate the Offeror's ability to comply with Section 508 requirements throughout this performance of this contract. Factor 2: Past Performance The Government will evaluate the Offeror's recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the SOO. The Offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar work--including all items as requested in Instructions to Offerors, Past Performance response--including customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing stated goals. If the Offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance or does not have any past performance information available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral. The Government may evaluate the past performance of the Offeror's proposed key subcontractors in the same manner as the prime contractor to the extent warranted. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance in awarding subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Factor 3: Price / Cost Price will be evaluated, but will not receive an adjectival rating. The Government will evaluate the total price proposed for each performance period (i.e. base and all option years) to determine price reasonableness as it relates to the technical requirements and to assist in the best value determination. The Price Proposal will be evaluated for accuracy, completeness and reasonableness. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing pursuant to FAR 15.404-1 (g) (3). The Offeror's responses will be evaluated for technical adequacy of the response in conjunction with the total price and to determine whether it is fair and reasonable. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's use if the proposed labor categories, rates, and unit prices of hardware in their response. The Government will evaluate the fairness

59

If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. In establishing the competitive range, the government will select a range of the most highly rated proposals. For purposes of establishing the competitive range, technical merit is more important than cost or price. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered. The factors listed below. Factor 1 ­ Technical and Management Approach Factor 2 ­ Past Performance

Factor 3 ­ Price / Cost M.5 DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE

OCC will award a contract to the Offeror of a proposal that is judged, by an integrated assessment of all of the evaluation factors, to be the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make one award or no award, depending upon the quality of the proposal submitted the availability of funds, and the estimated number of tasks. OCC will not, in any case, make award to an Offeror it considers to have substandard capabilities or unreasonable prices. If the offeror's proposal is determined unacceptable in any of the technical evaluation factors and/or subfactors, the proposal may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.

     Introduction


1 Document Purpose and Scope

This document describes the functional components of the Chief Counsel’s Office (CCO) Assignment Management System (AMS).

The scope of this document is limited to the functional requirements that will support the AMS business  processes.  Non-functional  requirements
(e.g., technical requirements, security requirements, audit trail requirements, performance requirements, and  detailed  reporting  requirements)
are captured in the AMS Supplementary Requirements Document.


2 AMS Project Background


1 Business Need

AMS will replace the Chief Counsel’s Office (CCO) Project Tracking System (PTS).

PTS, an application based on Lotus Notes, is currently a primary project/assignment reporting tool for the CCO  organization.  Assignments,  such
as requests for legal interpretations, licensing decisions and investigations, are entered into the system by assigned Lead(s) and  staff.  These
individuals report significant events, explanations and progress on assignments and matters until completion. Reports are  generated  from  Lotus
Notes views and used for management and discussions within CCO. The First  Senior  Deputy  Comptroller/Chief  Counsel  (FSDC/CC)  also  uses  PTS
reports to discuss project progress in regular meetings with her counterparts in the  Large  Bank  Supervision  and  the  Midsize/Community  Bank
Supervision departments. The system is also used to report compliance with internal timeframes for rendering external opinions.

Current concerns with the existing system include:

 • Limitations of the system’s flexibility with respect to reports. For example, the existing system does not provide ad hoc reporting.

 • Limitations of the system’s flexibility with respect to data entry. For example, the existing system does not auto-populate fields or  provide
   the capability to pre-enter fields in templates to expedite data entry.

 • Lack of tailoring to reflect differences among the Licensing, Community Affairs (CA), and Legal user  groups,  within  an  overall  consistent
   model

 • Failure to meet legal requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended

 • The possibility that inaccurate or untimely project tracking could lead to missed deadlines, inaccurate reports,  and  diminished  reputations
   for both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Headquarters and CCO

In 2003, attempts were made to enhance Lotus Notes PTS. While some enhancements were made to the system, it  is  still  not  delivering  all  the
services and utility needed by the CCO. In 2005, a more formal requirements  gathering  process  took  place  collecting  requirements  from  all
organizations within CCO. These requirements were documented in a draft System Requirements Specification.

In 2009, the PTS replacement effort restarted using the information gathered in 2005 as a starting  point,  culminating  in  the  completion  and
approval of the draft requirements document and a system use case model.


2 CCO Organization

The Chief Counsel’s Office is responsible for the management of the Licensing, Community Affairs and  Law  Departments.  The  staff  members  who
support these departments are primarily located at the OCC Headquarters (HQ) building in Washington, DC and at each  of  the  four  OCC  district
offices. The four district offices are located in New York City (Northeastern District), Chicago (Central District), Dallas (Southern  District),
and Denver (Western District). Figure 1–1 provides a high-level view of the organizational structure.

                                                                      [pic]
                                                     Figure 1–1 CCO Organizational Structure

The CCO staff organization is comprised of the following:

 • Law Department: 175

 • Licensing: 50

 • Community Affairs: 25

Note Although approximately 70% of the users of this system  are  legal  staff,  the  system  must  support  significant  and  equally  important
stakeholders in the Licensing and Community Affairs departments.


3 Project Scope

The scope for the first release of AMS includes the system features necessary to support the following assignment management business processes:

     • System Administration

     • Core Assignment Management

     • Staff Assignments Record

     • Dashboards and Reporting

The scope of the system use case models and the use case specifications (UCSs) in this document are limited to the user-to-system and  system-to-
system interactions applicable to the AMS business processes identified above. Interactions for other assignment  management  business  processes
are outside the scope of this document.


3 Methodology

The AMS project team worked collaboratively with key subject matter experts and reviewers (see Appendix F) to  discuss,  analyze,  document,  and
validate the user and system interactions with the envisioned AMS.

The team gathered information about user and system interactions and key participants and business processes primarily through  working  sessions
and interviews with the relevant business process owners and participants. The team leveraged the knowledge gained from the  development  of  the
draft requirements documents. The project team also reviewed the existing project tracking system.

The project team used notation and syntax that conforms to Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0. The UML standards used for AMS are  described  in
Appendix D of this document.


4 Reference Materials

The AMS project team used the following reference materials in preparing this document:

2 AMS Actors

UML defines those users that instantiate UCSs as actors. There are three types of actors involved with AMS, which  are  System  Roles,  Portfolio
and Assignment Roles, and Interfacing Systems.


1 System Roles

System Administrator The System Administrator is responsible for administering AMS. The System Administrator can name the Portfolio  Manager  and
Portfolio Administrator for each portfolio. For more specific information regarding the  privileges  associated  with  the  System  Administrator
role, see Appendix D, Roles and Privileges.

System User The System User is anyone with the capability to log in and interact with the AMS system. For  more  specific  information  regarding
the privileges associated with the System User role, see Appendix D, Roles and Privileges.


2 Portfolio and Assignment Roles

Unlike the System Roles, the Portfolio and Assignment Roles are not set by the System Administrator; rather they are a  result  of  System  Users
being named as a manager, administrator or team member for a particular portfolio or assignment during the operational use  of  the  system  (see
section 9, Manage Portfolios; section 20, Name a  Portfolio  Administrator;  section  21,  Create  an  Assignment;  and  section  22,  Manage  an
Assignment). It’s important to note that each System User can be acting in multiple Portfolio and Assignment roles at any one time.

Portfolio Manager A System User who has been named as the Portfolio Manager  for  an  assignment  portfolio  by  the  System  Administrator.  The
Portfolio Manager has decision-making  responsibility  and  accountability  for  a  portfolio.  The  Portfolio  Manager  can:  name  a  Portfolio
Administrator; add assignments to the portfolio; and name Assignment Managers for assignments in his portfolio.

The Portfolio Manager role often aligns with the organizational structure. The Chief Counsel may elect to assign the role to Deputy  Controllers,
Directors, and/or unit heads.

For more specific information regarding the privileges associated with the Portfolio Manager role, see Appendix D, Roles and Privileges.

Portfolio Administrator A System User who has been named as the Portfolio Administrator for a portfolio by the Portfolio Manager.  The  Portfolio
Administrator has the same privileges as the Portfolio Manager and can administer the designated portfolio within the system.

For more specific information regarding the privileges associated with the Portfolio Administrator role, see Appendix D, Roles and Privileges.

Assignment Manager A System User who has  been  named  as  an  Assignment  Manager  for  an  assignment  by  a  Portfolio  Manager  or  Portfolio
Administrator, or who has created an assignment and named  himself  as  the  Assignment  Manager.  The  Assignment  Manager  is  responsible  and
accountable to manage the assignment. The Assignment Manager has decision-making responsibility for the assignment, and the authority to  execute
within the established boundaries. The Assignment Manager can name  an  Assignment  Administrator  and  name  Assignment  Team  Members  for  his
assignment. For more specific information regarding the privileges associated with the  Assignment  Manager  role,  see  Appendix  D,  Roles  and
Privileges.

Assignment Administrator A System User who has been named as the Assignment Administrator for  an  assignment  by  the  Assignment  Manager.  The
Assignment Administrator has the same privileges as the Assignment Manager and can administer the designated assignment within  the  system.  For
more specific information regarding the privileges associated with the Assignment Administrator role, see Appendix D, Roles and Privileges.

Assignment Team Member A System User who has been named as a team member for an assignment by an Assignment Manager or Assignment  Administrator,
or who has named himself as a team member. For more specific information regarding the privileges associated  with  the  Assignment  Team  Member
role, see Appendix D, Roles and Privileges.

Notification Recipient The Notification Recipient role is depicted  in  use  cases  where  there  are  multiple  primary  actors  and  where  the
notification recipient (a secondary actor) is dependent upon which of the primary actors executed the use case. For example, when  the  Portfolio
Manager, Portfolio Administrator, and Assignment Manager are  the  primary  actors,  the  Portfolio  Administrator  and  Assignment  Manager  are
Notification Recipients when the Portfolio Manager executes the use case. Alternatively, when the Portfolio Administrator executes the use  case,
the Portfolio Manager and Assignment Manager are Notification Recipients. When the Assignment  Manager  executes  the  use  case,  the  Portfolio
Manager and Portfolio Administrator are Notification Recipients.

In each use case where the Notification Recipient is an actor, a use case specific definition is provided.


3 Interfacing Systems

AMS will interface with the HR Hub and Operational Data Store (ODS). Although there is no requirement to interface with the  Central  Application
Tracking System (CATS), e-TIME, or OpenText at this time, the definitions of these interfacing systems, along with their  associated  use  cases,
are included in this document as potential future requirements.

CATS The Central Application Tracking System, an Appian Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) application, provides bank applicants and  their
agents with an integrated easy-to-use self-service data-entry portal allowing  Licensing  and  Community  Affairs  to  accept,  process,  manage,
disposition, and report on filings received. AMS will use the interface to receive licensing actions and data, and  integrate  the  reporting  of
tasks in CATS and AMS. This interface is a future requirement.

e-TIME The e-TIME application is a web-based system that all OCC employees use to electronically record their time and leave. AMS  will  use  the
interface to receive activities and project codes. This interface is a potential future requirement.

HR Hub The HR Hub is the data warehouse that stores data from HR Connect for access by external applications.  AMS  will  use  the  interface  to
receive personnel and organizational data.

ODS The ODS contains financial institution data. AMS will use the interface to receive bank related data.

OpenText The OpenText application serves as one of the OCC’s document management  system  and  as  the  official  electronic  records  management
system. AMS will use the interface to send documents to OpenText for document management, and to send official records to OpenText for  long-term
retention and records management. This interface is a potential future requirement.


     AMS System Use Case Models

The high-level AMS system use case models depict a summarized  view  of  the  end-to-end  processes  for:  administering  the  system;  creating,
assigning, and managing assignments; managing user-related information and settings; and viewing dashboards and  generating  reports.  Additional
details are provided in subsequent sections of this document.

The AMS system use case models describe the to-be user-to-system and system-to-system interactions. The system use case  models  consist  of  the
UCSs that describe the distinct goals of the to-be system actors. Sections 3.1 through 3.4 document the system use  case  models  for  AMS.  Each
subsequent section (section 4 through 34) represents a single use case. Use case terminology is defined in the UML notation provided in  Appendix
D.

     Add Metadata Fields


1 Use Case Description

This use case describes the flow of events to add assignment metadata fields during the operations and maintenance phase of  the  system.  It  is
assumed that the assignment metadata fields, as defined in Table B-1 Assignment Metadata Fields, will be configured during  initial  set-up,  and
that the system will accommodate a fixed number of new assignment metadata fields not anticipated (and not allocated) during initial set-up  (see
the Reference Data Requirements section of the AMS Supplementary Requirements Document). The  System  Administrator  requests  a  new  assignment
metadata field, and configures the metadata field as free-form text, pre-defined, selection menu, check box,  or  radio  button.  This  use  case
concludes with the metadata field being saved and the change being committed to the AMS database.

Note The term pre-defined is meant to describe situations where metadata fields are dependent on previous selections.


                                                                      [pic]

     Introduction


1 Document Purpose

This document describes the supplementary requirements of the Chief Counsel’s Office (CCO) Assignment Management System (AMS).

A supplementary requirement is defined as any requirement that is not readily described by a use case (e.g., technical requirements,  performance
requirements, security requirements, and accessibility requirements). Requirements that are described by a use  case  are  captured  in  the  AMS
Functional Requirements Document. Together, the supplementary requirements and the  functional  requirements  constitute  the  full  set  of  AMS
requirements.


2 AMS Project Background

PTS, an application based on Lotus Notes, is currently a primary project/assignment reporting tool for the CCO  organization.  Assignments,  such
as requests for legal interpretations, licensing decisions and investigations, are entered into the system by assigned Lead(s) and  staff.  These
individuals report significant events, explanations and progress on assignments and matters until completion. Reports are  generated  from  Lotus
Notes views and used for management and discussions within CCO. The First Senior Deputy  Comptroller/Chief  Counsel’s  (FSDC/CC)  also  uses  PTS
reports to discuss project progress in regular meetings with her counterparts in the  Large  Bank  Supervision  and  the  Midsize/Community  Bank
Supervision departments. The system is also used to report compliance with internal timeframes for rendering external opinions.

Current concerns with the existing system include:

 • Limitations of the system’s flexibility with respect to reports. For example, the existing system does not provide ad hoc reporting.

 • Limitations of the system’s flexibility with respect to data entry. For example, the existing system does not auto-populate fields or  provide
   the capability to pre-enter fields in templates to expedite data entry.

 • Lack of tailoring to reflect differences among the Licensing, Community Affairs (CA), and Legal user  groups,  within  an  overall  consistent
   model

 • Failure to meet legal requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended

 • The possibility that inaccurate or untimely project tracking could lead to missed deadlines, inaccurate reports,  and  diminished  reputations
   for both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Headquarters and CCO

In 2003, attempts were made to enhance Lotus Notes PTS. While some enhancements were made to the system, it  is  still  not  delivering  all  the
services and utility needed by the CCO. In 2005, a more formal requirements  gathering  process  took  place  collecting  requirements  from  all
organizations within CCO. These requirements were documented in a draft System Requirements Specification.

In 2009, the PTS replacement effort restarted using the information gathered in 2005 as a starting  point,  culminating  in  the  completion  and
approval of the draft requirements document and a system use case model.


1 CCO Organization

The Chief Counsel’s Office is responsible for the management of the Licensing, Community Affairs, and Law  Departments.  The  staff  members  who
support these departments are primarily located at the OCC Headquarter (HQ) building in Washington, DC and at  each  of  the  four  OCC  district
offices. The four district offices are located in New York City (Northeastern District), Chicago (Central District), Dallas (Southern  District),
and Denver (Western District). Figure 1–1 provides a high-level view of the organizational structure.

                                                                      [pic]
                                                     Figure 1–1 CCO Organizational Structure

The CCO staff organization is comprised as follows:

 • Law Department: 175

 • Licensing: 50

 • Community Affairs: 25

Note Although approximately 70% of the users of this system  are  legal  staff,  the  system  must  support  significant  and  equally  important
stakeholders in the Licensing and Community Affairs departments.


3 Methodology


1 Gathering and Validating Requirements

The AMS project team leveraged industry best practices and existing requirements literature  to  gather,  analyze,  document,  and  validate  the
supplementary requirements. The team also utilized the OCC’s Performance Management and Compensation System (PMCS) and  Personnel  Administration
and Security System (PASS) supplementary requirements as a basis for the AMS supplementary requirements. Refer to section 1.4 for  a  listing  of
reference materials that the team used when gathering and validating requirements.

For ease of review, the technical requirements associated with reporting and querying have been integrated with the functional  requirements  and
placed in the AMS Functional Requirements Document (see section 11, Manage Canned Reports, and section 34, Generate Reports).


2 Managing Requirements

The AMS team uses Rational RequisitePro to capture and manage the infrastructure requirements. The AMS Rational RequisitePro project is based  on
the Rational RequisitePro use case template. Refer to the AMS Requirements Management Plan for details about the organization and  management  of
the AMS RequisitePro project.

Performance Measures and Acceptance Standards

Performance Objectives

The OCC’s performance objectives for AMS are to deliver the project on schedule with a high level of quality. To measure performance against these objectives, the OCC will evaluate the contractor using the performance measures described in the “Performance Measures and Acceptance Standards” attachment to this SOO.  On a monthly basis, the COTR will calculate these measures and the Contracting Officer will report them to the contractor as well as on the Contract Performance Assessment and Review System (CPARS).

AMS Performance Objectives

Milestone Timeliness

The milestone timeliness performance measure is the ratio of actual milestones completed on time to the total number of planned contractual milestones in a given month. The computation of the measure is as follows: t = number of timely milestones for the month / total milestones for that month. The milestone timeliness ratio will be translated into a monthly milestone timeliness measure, according to the criteria in the table below.

Milestone Timeliness Performance Standards

Please note that when the contractor expects to be late in the completion of a milestone, the OCC expects advance notice via e-mail that the milestone will be missed. Notice must be provided as soon as the contractor is aware of the delay, but no less than two (2) business days in advance of the milestone date. Please note that the contractor will not be penalized in the event deliverables are delayed due to untimely response from the government.

Deliverable Quality

The deliverable quality performance measure gauges the level of quality of deliverables provided to the PMO. For each deliverable subject to a quality score, the COTR will assign one deliverable quality score, based on the guidelines described in The PMO Quality Assurance Plan and, as necessary, input from reviews of the deliverable. The table below identifies the deliverable quality scores that will be used for this contract.

Deliverable Quality Scores

Deliverables receiving a score of 2 (Needs Improvement) or 1 (Unsatisfactory) will require rework and resubmission. The contractor will continue to submit revised deliverables to the COTR until the deliverable receives a minimum score of 3 (Satisfactory). For the purposes of computing the monthly deliverable quality score, the score recorded for that deliverable will be the score awarded to the original submission (i.e., the original “Needs Improvement” or “Unsatisfactory” score).

At the end of each month, the COTR will average the deliverable quality scores: a = (deliverable quality score1 + . . . + deliverable quality scoren) / n. The monthly average of deliverable quality scores will be translated into a monthly deliverable quality measure, according to the criteria in the table below.

1The PMO Document Review Process

Overview

The PMO document review process is one of the PMO’s quality assurance processes. The process applies to document deliverables and work products as appropriate.    This process is distinct from the COTR’s inspection process in that:

None of the document reviewers is the COTR

Scores provided by document reviewers are not used to calculate the monthly deliverable quality performance metric, although the COTR may take them under advisement when determining the deliverable’s official quality score.

Only documents identified as document deliverables undergo the document review process. The contractor must produce four distinct versions of a document that undergoes the document review process:

The management review version

The quality assurance review version

The PMO-customer review version

The final version.

Each version is a contract deliverable. As such, each version is read, scored, and accepted by the COTR. Each version has a contract due date, and failure to deliver any version on time results in a missed timeliness milestone, which impacts the monthly timeliness performance measure.

The document review process proceeds as follows. The contractor delivers the management review version of the document. The management review version is reviewed by the PMO Project Manager and the PMO Project Manager Team Lead. (Since one of these individuals is designated as the contract COTR, the management review includes, by default, the COTR’s initial review of the deliverable.) After receiving the OCC’s comments on the management review version, the contractor will:

Consolidate comments received from the reviewers

Review and suggest a resolution for each comment

As necessary, work with the Project Manager and reviewers to resolve comments

Obtain the COTR’s approval for all comment resolutions

Revise the document to produce the next version, in this case the quality assurance review version.

The quality assurance review version is then reviewed by two members of the PMO who are not part of the project team. After receiving the OCC’s comments, the contractor then repeats steps 1 through 5 to produce the PMO-customer review version. The PMO-customer review version is then reviewed by team members in the customer organization, i.e., the OCC business unit for which the PMO is managing the project. As necessary, this version may also be reviewed in parallel by other business units. Typically, this means review by other members of ITS. After receiving the OCC’s comments, the contractor repeats steps 1 through 5 to produce the final version of the document.

Review Times

 lists the minimum time the OCC has to review each version and deliver comments to the contractor. The contractor should use these minimums for schedule planning purposes. In some cases, the OCC may require longer review times. On fixed-price tasks, if the minimum times were assumed in the schedule and the OCC required longer review times and the contractor can demonstrate that longer review times resulted in a material impact to the cost of completing the task, the contractor should request an equitable adjustment.

 also lists the maximum time the contractor has to revise each version after receipt of comments. The contractor should use these maximums for schedule planning purposes. Requests for additional revision time should be made to the COTR and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. That said, contractors must realize that formal contractual due dates can only be changed by the Contracting Officer and a request to the COTR is no guarantee a date change will be granted by the CO.

Table  Minimum Times for Deliverable Review and Revision

Formal contractual time minimums notwithstanding, when practical the OCC will make efforts to minimize the total review time. Also, under certain circumstances, given agreement between the COTR and the contractor, the process can be modified to expedite review. For example, the management review and quality assurance review might be done in parallel using one version of the document. However, for schedule planning purposes, the contractor should assume the minimum review times, unless discussed in advance with the COTR.

Version Requirements for Other Documents

The contractor must typically produce two distinct versions of a document that does not undergo the document review process (and thus is not scored):

The management review version

The final version.

For these documents, if the COTR does not require any changes after inspection, the management review version becomes the final version.

     Introduction

The <project acronym> Document Formatting and Style Guide provides practical guidance to authors, editors, reviewers, and all others involved  in
the development of documents for the Operations Program Management Office (OPMO). The guide provides guidance in several ways:

Direct Example The guide itself is laid out and formatted the way a formal OPMO document should be laid out and formatted. As a result, users  of
the guide can understand how their documents should look by looking at the guide.

Detailed Formatting Instructions To go beyond direct example, the guide provides detailed instructions on a  variety  of  formatting  issues—from
pager headers, to section headings, to captions, to vertical lists—explaining exactly how to format elements of the document.  Because  the  same
formatting result can sometimes be achieved in different ways, consistency in how elements are  formatted  helps  simplify  document  maintenance
within and across documents.

Style Definitions Properly defined and consistently applied text styles are the cornerstone for  properly  formatting  a  document.  With  a  few
exceptions, the guide defines all of the text styles needed in an OPMO document. The guide also describes where particular styles should be  used
in a document.

Guidance on Editorial Style This guide provides guidance on editorial style based on the OCC’s style manual and The Chicago Manual of Style,  [1]
the two reference preferred by the OCC for editorial style. Most of the editorial style issues addressed in this guide are issues where  the  two
preferred manuals conflict or allow for choices on a given matter.

Guidance on Word Features While the guide is not intended to be a reference  for  Microsoft  Word,  it  does  describe  Word  features  that  are
important to proper formatting.

This guide is organized into three major sections. Section 2 focuses on practical matters related to document formatting and  layout,  section  3
focuses on editorial style, and section 4 presents tips on using Microsoft Word 2003.


     Document Formatting, Layout, and Branding

Consistent formatting within a document gives a document a professional look and feel and an overall sense of quality. Consistent formatting  and
layout across multiple documents from an organization creates a familiar look and feel that allows documents to  be  instantly  recognized  as  a
product of that organization. That is, it creates a brand for the organization.

This section provides practical guidance on how to consistently format and lay out documents so that every document looks professional and  helps
to establish a brand for the publishing organization.


1 Word Styles and Proper Formatting

Microsoft Word has a feature known as styles that allows publishers to easily format documents in a consistent, professional  manner.  There  are
styles for paragraph, character, list, and table formatting. Proper style definitions and their consistent application to the text in a  document
are absolutely key to proper document formatting.

A full discussion of Microsoft styles and all of their features is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  guide.  Publishers  should  take  the  time  to
familiarize themselves with Microsoft styles. Information about styles is available in Word’s online help, at various sites on the  web,  and  in
many of the better books on Microsoft Word.

This guide does describe the definitions for the most common styles used in OPMO documents and where they should be  applied.  Publishers  should
take the time to familiarize themselves with these style definitions and their proper application.


1 The Normal and Normal Sans Serif Styles

The “Normal” and “Normal Sans Serif” styles are basic styles upon which most other styles are based. Generally  speaking,  a  document  will  not
have text formatted with either of these styles. (One notable exception is the text on the document control page.)


2 The Body Text Style

The “Body Text” style is the core document style and should be used to format the bulk of the text in a document. They style is defined to  fully
justify text and properly space paragraphs without the need for inserting blank lines.


3 The Title Page Styles

Formatting of a document’s title page is done with four separate styles: Title Page 1—4. In combination, these styles provide the  right  mix  of
colors, sizes, and justifications for formatting a title page. Generally speaking, other than the title page,  these  styles  will  not  be  used
anywhere else in a document. (See section 2.4 for information about formatting a title page.)


4 The Page Heading Style

The “Page Heading” style is typically used for headings on pages outside the body of a document, like the document  control  page  or  the  first
page of the table of contents. That said, it is also appropriate to use it at the top of other pages when it makes sense.

The “Page Heading” style definition automatically inserts a page break before  the  text  it  is  applied  to.  Eliminate  the  page  break  when
necessary.


5 The Heading Styles (Section Headings)

Heading styles 1—8 should be used to format the section headings of a document. These styles will automatically generate section  numbers  before
the text they are applied to, and they will properly set the color, size, and type style (i.e., bold or italic)  for  each  heading.  (Note  that
there is no differentiation in the formatting between styles 5 through 8, since the need for headings to that level are uncommon.  If  necessary,
publishers can modify these style definitions to differentiate these headings.)

Text that is formatted with a heading style will automatically appear in the table of  contents  and  can  be  referred  to  with  a  Word  cross
reference. (See section 2.17 for information on Word cross references.)


1 The Heading 9 Style

Use the “Heading 9” style to format the title of an appendix. The “Heading 9” style will  automatically  generate  the  word  “Appendix”  and  an
appendix letter before the text it is applied to.

Like other heading styles, text formatted with the “Heading 9” style will appear in the table of contents and can be  referred  to  with  a  Word
cross reference.


6 The Caption Above and Caption Below Styles

Use the “Caption Above” style to format captions placed above the captioned object (like  tables).  Use  the  “Caption  Below”  style  to  format
captions placed below the captioned object (like pictures and diagrams). These style definitions will automatically adjust the space between  the
caption and the captioned object and between the caption and the text before or after the caption.


7 The Header and Footer Styles

Use the “Header” style to format text in page headers and the “Footer” style to format text in page footers.

Sections 2.10 and 2.11 discuss standard formatting for headers and footers.


8 The In-Line Heading Style

The “In-Line Heading” style is defined in two colors: black and red. Use the In-Line Heading style to introduce a paragraph  that  benefits  from
more than a bullet to introduce it. Do not use punctuation—colons, hyphens, dashes, etc.—after an  in-line  heading.  Avoid  using  the  “In-Line
Heading” in combination with bullets. One graphic device is usually sufficient.


9 The In-Line Graphic Style

Format pictures, charts, diagrams, and any graphic in the body of your text with the “In-Line Graphic” style. This style will center the  graphic
and properly space the graphic and the caption.


10 The Page Number Style

Do not use it. Use the “Footer” style to format the page number (see 2.1.7).


11 The TOC Styles

The nine table of contents (TOC) styles have been defined to give the document’s table of contents a look that is consistent  with  the  body  of
the document. They Word will automatically apply these styles to the table of contents when it is generated. One should rarely—or  never—have  to
modify a TOC style.


2 Word’s Hyphenation Feature

When using fully justified text in documents, Word’s hyphenation feature should be turned on to limit noticeable gaps in  the  typesetting.  Turn
this feature on by selecting “Tools → Language → Hyphenation . . .” from the menu bar. The following window will appear:


                                                                      [pic]
                                                      Figure 2–1 Word’s “Hyphenation” Window

Make sure “Automatically hyphenate document” is checked. “Hyphenate words in CAPS” should also be checked, but  even  if  it  is  unchecked,  the
chance of it impacting a document is small. With fully justified text, the hyphenation zone setting essentially has no effect and can be kept  at
the 0.25” default value. The limit on consecutive hyphens should be set to “No limit.”

Word’s ability to fully justify text has improved with each version. In Word 2003, there are usually  very  few  problems  with  fully  justified
text. But one common situation is when a very long URL is used in a sentence. For example:

Support information can be found at http://www-306.ibm.com/software/rational/support/contact.html?rcss=rtladadev.

Avoid situations like this by rewriting the URL so it is introduced with a colon. For example:

Support information can found at the following URL:

http://www-306.ibm.com/software/rational/support/contact.html?rcss=rtladadev.


1 Preventing Hyphenation

Generally speaking, hyphenation in titles, headings, table of contents entries, etc. is undesirable. The style definitions  for  those  types  of
text have been set so that they will not hyphenate when Word’s hyphenation feature is turned on. Hyphenation should also be  turned  off  on  the
document control page.

You can prevent hyphenation of a single word by selecting the word and typing ATL-r-u. In the “Language”  pop-up  window,  check  “Do  not  check
spelling or grammar.” The selected word should no longer be hyphenated.

5 The Document Control Page

The document control page provides a single location for document metadata, i.e., data about the document. The page is formatted  with  the  page
title “Document Control Page” (see section 2.6). The remainder of the page consists of  metadata  descriptions  and  values.  Each  line  on  the
document control page should have tabs placed at 2 1/8 and 2 3/4 inches from the margin. The tab location can be adjusted if necessary.  Metadata
descriptions are formatted with the In-Line Heading Black style. Group similar metadata together by inserting an extra line between items.[2]

To properly format the metadata description and its value, type the description, a tab, and the value; format the line  with  the  Normal  style;
and then format the description with the In-Line Heading Black style.

There are no hard-and-fast rules about what metadata to include on the document control page. Publishers are encouraged to  exercise  their  good
judgment. Table 2–1 suggests what metadata to include given certain circumstances.

Metadata values that are used other places in the document—like a project name used in a header—should be bookmarked and  then  cross  referenced
from the other places they are used. Because of this, take care  when  editing  metadata  values,  otherwise  you  may  inadvertently  clobber  a
bookmark. (See section 2.3 for a discussion of bookmarks.)

In older documents it was common to include a description of changes or version history on the document control page or  right  after  it.  Avoid
both of these. Descriptions of changes are rarely complete or detailed enough to be  useful.  If  it  is  important  to  detail  changes  between
versions of a document, create a “delta version” of the document using Word’s document compare feature.

Version histories are difficult to maintain and are of little use to the average reader. Instead, rely  on  the  features  of  repositories  like
SharePoint or Open Text to properly maintain version history.

The document control page for a typical contract deliverable would appear as follows:


Document Control Page

Project Name     <project name>

Project Acronym  <project acronym>

Document Title   <[<project acronym>] <short title>>

Document Date    <document date>

6 Page Titles

Pages between the title page and the first page of the document’s main body should include a page title  at  the  start  of  different  types  of
content. Page titles that typically appear in a document are “Document Control,” “Table of Contents,” “List of Figures,” and  “List  of  Tables.”
If the document does not require a given page title, leave it out. For example, if a document does not contain any  figures,  making  a  list  of
figures unnecessary, do not include a “List of Figures” page title. Publishers may add additional page titles when necessary.

“Document Control” should always be the first page title after the title page, followed by “Table of Contents.” The  order  for  subsequent  page
titles is left to the discretion of the publisher.

Page titles are always formatted with the Page Title style.


7 The Table of Contents

Include a table of contents in the document right after the document control page. The table of contents should start on a new page  with  “Table
of Contents” at the top of the page. Format “Table of Contents” with the “Page Heading” style.

Use the following field code to generate the table of contents: { TOC \h \o \u \w \* MERGEFORMAT }. If the heading styles  are  properly  applied
to all section headings, including appendix headings, then this code should properly generate a table of contents.

As an example, see this document’s table of contents on page ii.


8 Section Headings

Section headings consist of a section number and a section title:

<section number> <title>

1 Introduction

2.3.1 Technical Approach Details

Sections are numbered using a hierarchical numbering scheme: 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc. The formatting applied to the section  heading  depends  on  the
level of the section in the hierarchy. Generally, headings at the top of the hierarchy have a larger font and are distinguished with color  or  a
bold typeface.

To properly format section headings, use one of the eight heading styles, “Heading 1” through “Heading 8.” (“Heading 9” is reserved for  appendix
headings.) If heading styles are properly applied, Word will generate the section number automatically, the  level-specific  formatting  for  the
heading will be correct, the heading will automatically appear in the table of contents, and it will be possible to refer to the section  with  a
cross reference.

Note that major section numbers never have a trailing zero; it is section 1, not section 1.0, anymore than it would be section 1.1.0.


1 Page Breaks before Major Sections

The “Heading 1” style is defined so that it inserts a page break before the section, forcing major sections to always start on  a  new  page.  In
shorter documents, starting major sections on a new page may not be desirable. To disable the automatic page break, select “Format →  Styles  and
Formatting . . .” from the menu bar. In the “Styles and Formatting” window, find “Heading 1” in the list of styles, and select  “Modify  .  .  .”
from its context menu. The “Modify Style” window will appear. Click the “Format” menu control in the bottom left corner and select  “Paragraph  .
. .” In the “Paragraph” window, select the “Line and Page Breaks” tab, and then unselect the “Page break before”  option.  Click  “OK”  and  “OK”
again to save the change.


                                                                      [pic]
                                                       Figure 2–2 Word’s “Paragraph” Window


9 Appendix Headings

Appendices are labeled sequentially using a capital letter: A, B, C, etc. The complete header for the appendix consists of the  word  “Appendix,”
followed by the letter label, followed by the title:

      Appendix <capital letter> <title>

      Appendix A Acronyms

      Appendix B Address List

There is no punctuation between the letter and the title.

To properly format the appendix header, apply the “Heading 9” style to the title. Word will automatically generate the word  “Appendix”  and  the
proper letter. With the “Heading 9” style, the appendix will also show up in the table of  contents  and  you  can  refer  to  it  with  a  cross
reference. (See Appendix A as an example.)


10 Standard Header

The standard header is used on every page except the title page. The standard header consists of two lines with the  following  items  positioned
and formatted as described:

   1. The project acronym or name, if there is no acronym, on the first line, left justified, and formatted with the “Header” style

   2. The document title or subtitle on the second line, left justified, and formatted with the “Header” style

   3. The acronym for the client organization on the second line, right justified, and formatted with the “Header” style

In this document, all of the text in the header is generated automatically from  bookmarks  on  the  document  control  page  (see  sections  2.3
and2.5). The project name is generated from the projectName bookmark, the title from docTitle, and the client acronym from  clientOrgAcronym.  If
you properly edit these bookmarks on the document control page, you will not have to make any edits to the headers in the document.

Deviate from the standard and adjust information in the header when it makes sense. For example, if you are creating an internal  OPMO  document,
then it probably does not make sense to have a client organization in the header. Instead, you might just want to  replace  it  with  “OPMO.”  In
this example, it may also make sense to omit a project name.


11 Standard Footer

The standard footer is used on every page except the title page. The standard footer has the following items on a  single  line,  positioned  and
formatted as described:

   1. “Operations Program Management Office,” left justified, formatted with the “Footer” style, and color set to dark red

   2. The page number, centered and formatted with the “Footer” style

   3. The document’s date, the word “Version,” and the document’s version number, right justified and formatted with the “Footer” style.

Top the footer with a single graphic line with width ½ point and colored dark red.

For guidance on page number style (i.e., Roman, Arabic, with or without section numbers, etc.), see section 2.12.

There are a number of methods for positioning items in the footer. This guide does not dictate the method,  but  does  suggest  using  a  center-
aligned tab and right-aligned tab to position the page number and document date and version.

Use Word’s page number feature to automatically generate page numbers.

The document date on the document control page is bookmarked as “docDate.” For the document date in the footer, use  a  cross  reference  to  the
bookmark, that way the date in the footer will always match the date on the document control page.

See the footer on this page as an example of a properly formatted footer.


12 Page Numbers

Except for the title page, all pages have a page number in the footer in the center of the page.

Pages numbers on pages before the main body of the document, like the document control page or table of contents, are lower case Roman  numerals,
e.g., i, ii, iii.

Page numbers for pages in the main body of the document are Arabic numerals, e.g., 1, 2, 3.

Page numbers for appendices have the form:

      <appendix letter>-<Arabic numeral>

Use Word’s page number formatting features to get the appendix letter and hyphen to appear before the page number. A section  break  before  each
appendix will be necessary to allow for proper formatting of the appendix page numbers. The first page of an appendix should always be page 1.

If the content of an appendix is from an external source and already contains page numbers, simply make the first page of  the  appendix  a  page
with only the appendix header, number that page as described above, and then place the external content on  following  pages  with  its  original
numbering.


13 Inserting an En Dash and Other Common Special Characters

To insert an en dash (–), em dash (—), section symbol (§), or other common special character, select “Insert → Symbol . . .” from the  tool  bar.
In the “Symbol” window, click the “Symbol” tab. Click the special character you want to insert, and then click the “Insert”  button  (see  Figure
2–3).

Note that there are shortcut key sequences defined for most of the special characters. You can also directly insert the character by  typing  the
shortcut key sequence.

If the special character you need appears somewhere else in the document or in another document, you can also simply cut and paste it.

Note that an en dash is longer than a hyphen, which is easily typed from the keyboard, and an em dash is longer than an en dash. An  en  dash  is
used in figure and table numbers. See Sections 2.14 and 2.15 for details about the structure and formatting of figure and table numbers.


                                                                      [pic]
                                                        Figure 2–3 Word’s “Symbol” Window


14 Figure Captions and Numbers

Place a caption below all figures. Format the entire caption with the “Caption Below” style. In the caption, include a figure  number  and  short
text describing the figure. The figure number should include the word “Figure” followed by the major section number in which the figure  appears,
followed by an en dash, followed by a one-up sequence number (starting with 1) that sequentially numbers  all  of  the  figures  in  the  primary
section:

      Figure <primary section number>–<sequence number> <caption text>

Primary section numbers and the sequence number should be formatted as Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, . . .). Use an en dash, not  a  hyphen,  between
the primary section number and the sequence number. Do not use any punctuation between the figure  number  and  the  caption:  no  colons,  semi-
colons, commas, periods, etc. Capitalize the description of the figure as you would a title.

See the caption for Figure 2–1 as an example.

If your heading styles are applied properly, you can generate the major section number with this  Word  field  code:  {  STYLEREF  1  \s  }.  The
sequence number can be generated with { SEQ Figure \* Arabic \s 1 }. You can get the correct field  codes  into  your  document  by  cutting  and
pasting a figure caption from this document, or you can enter them directly from the menu with Insert→Fields . . .

We use an en dash in figure and table numbers because en dashes are typically used to connect numbers (see Chicago §6.83).


15 Table Captions and Numbers

Tables should be captioned like figures (see section 2.14.), with the following differences:

   1. Place the caption above the table

   2. Format the caption with the “Caption Above” style

   3. Use the word “Table” before the number in the caption

   4. Use { SEQ Table \* Arabic \s 1 } to generate the sequence number.

See the caption on Table 2–2 as an example.


                                                          Table 2–2 Sample Table Caption
|Column Heading 1                             |Column Heading 2                                  |Column Heading 3                          |
|Table Cell Data                              |Table Cell Data                                   |Table Cell Text                           |
|Table Cell Text                              |Table Cell Text                                   |Table Cell Text                           |



16 Formatting Vertical Lists

For information on punctuating vertical lists, see section 3.6.

When possible, introduce vertical lists with a complete sentence. Whether introducing the list with a complete  or  incomplete  sentence,  follow
the introductory text with a colon—no semicolons or commas.

To format a bulleted or numbered list:

    ● Type the list into the document, one item per line, without entering bullets or numbers.

    ● Select all of the items in the list.

    ● Apply the Normal style.

    ● For a bulleted list, apply the Outline List-Bullet style. For an enumerated list, apply the Outline  List-Number  style.  Do  not  use  the
      List, List Bullet, List Continue, or List Number styles.

    ● Apply full justification to the items by clicking the icon on the formatting toolbar.

    ● To increase the indent level on an item, select the item and hit the tab key.

    ● To decrease the indent level on an item, select the item and hit the backspace key.

The Outline List styles will inert a bullet, number, or letter at 0.25” and set the text of the item at 0.5”.

If you want a blank line between the items in a list, format the items with the Body Text style instead of the Normal style before  applying  the
Outline List style.

First sample list:

    ● Item 1

    ● Item 2

    ● Item 3

    ● Item 4

Second sample list:

    ● Item 1

      ○ Item 1.1

         ■ Item 1.1.1

    ● Item 2

    ● Item 3

Third sample list:

   1. Item 1

     a. Item 1.1

        i. Item 1.2

   2. Item 2

   3. Item 3


17 Cross References

Always use Word’s cross reference feature to refer to sections, appendices, tables, and figures in the body text  of  the  document.  Using  this
feature will reduce the number of incorrect cross references, especially in documents undergoing a large number of revisions  or  documents  with
multiple authors. You can access the cross reference feature from “Insert → Reference → Cross-reference . . .”

Using just the section number or appendix letter in a cross reference is sufficient. For example, “See section 1.” or “See  Appendix  A.”  rather
than “See section 1 Introduction.” or “See Appendix A Acronyms.” However, either style is acceptable.

In cross references to sections, do not capitalize the word “section.” (See section 3.3 for additional guidance  on  capitalization.)  Note  that
when using Word cross references to appendices, tables,  and  figures,  capitalization  of  the  words  “Appendix,”  ‘Table,”  and  “Figure”  is,
regrettably, unavoidable.

Word cross references do not update automatically. Printing the document will force an update, if your preferences are set properly. (Print to  a
PDF file to avoid wasting paper.) Closing and re-opening the document will also update the cross references. As part of  the  final  check  of  a
document, it is a good idea to search for “Error!” to find any dead cross references.


18 OPMO Red

The specific color of red used in OPMO documents for headings, graphic lines, and elsewhere is a custom color. The red,  green,  blue  components
for the color are red=128, green=0, and blue=0.

To set the specific color, choose “More colors . . .” from any color selection menu. When the “Colors” window opens, click the “Custom”  tab  and
set “Color model:” to “RGB” and set the values for red, green, and blue.


                                                                      [pic]
                                                        Figure 2–3 Word’s “Colors” Window


     Editorial Style

The OCC has a style manual that can be found online at:

      http://occnet/OCCnet/style1.asp

The OCC style manual covers a number of editorial style issues, but much of it is devoted to  defining  acronyms.  Still,  it  is  a  good  first
reference for editorial style. For matters it does not cover, it directs readers to consult the  Chicago  Manual  of  Style,  probably  the  most
complete style manual for United States English.

This section addresses some of the most common editorial style issues. Some of the issues included here are also clearly addressed in one of  the
style manuals and are only included for convenience or emphasis. Other issues are included because the other manuals (usually the Chicago  Manual
of Style) allow for multiple possibilities, and this guide decides the matter.

Where applicable, references to the OCC style manual and the Chicago Manual of Style  have  been  included,  so  that  readers  can  get  further
guidance on an issue.


1 Acronym Definition and Use

When defining and using acronyms, keep these guidelines in mind:

   1. Define an acronym by placing it in parentheses after the term for which it stands.

   2. Define acronyms in the body text of the document—do not define acronyms in titles, page headers, page footers, or section headings.

   3. When possible, define an acronym before you use it. (The previous guideline may not make  this  possible,  so  it  is  sometimes  okay  for
      acronyms to appear in titles, page headers, page footers, and section headings before they are defined.)

   4. When possible, do not define an acronym more than once. (In certain situations, when a document is compiled from a variety of  sources  and
      the time to publish is short, editors can allow for duplicate definitions.)

   5. If the term for the acronym would not normally be capitalized, do not capitalize it when defining the acronym.

   6. When an acronym is defined after the plural form of the term for which it stands, do not make the definition in the parentheses plural:  “a
      dozen passport applications (PA)” and not “a dozen passport applications (PAs).”

   7. After defining an acronym, make it plural, as appropriate, by adding an “s” with no apostrophe: “We processed a dozen POs today.”

   8. Even after you have defined an acronym for a term, you may still opt to use the full term rather than the acronym. You may want to do  this
      in situations where you want to reinforce the definition of the acronym in the reader’s mind or when the acronym is being  used  repeatedly
      to the point where it feels repetitive.

Note that the second guideline sets up situations where you might use an acronym before you define it, especially in document titles  or  section
headings. It is correct to have a document title on a title page like CATS Functional Requirements Document. That title is preferable to  Central
Application Tracking System (CATS) Functional Requirements Document, even though the first title uses the acronym “CATS” before it is defined.

Definition of an acronym more than once happens most frequently in documents where multiple authors  contribute  content.  Use  extra  care  when
editing those documents to eliminate multiple definitions. In some cases, like when documents contain  appendices  with  content  that  has  been
created independently from the document, duplicate definitions may be unavoidable.

Using the full term for an acronym, even after the acronym has been defined, is acceptable, and it is sometimes a good strategy  for  reinforcing
the meaning of unfamiliar acronyms.


2 Ampersands (&)

Unless there is a pressing space issue, avoid using ampersands.


3 Capitalization

For all the detailed rules in this area, see Chicago. More generally, remember the following key rules.


1 Capitalization in Body Text

In general, capitalization of nouns and adjectives in body text is limited to  proper  nouns  and  adjectives.  Words  that  merely  seem  to  be
important because of their context should not be capitalized. So if you are writing a section about how the “application  server”  works,  it  is
just that: an “application server” and not an “Application Server.”

Words that are capitalized in titles or headings should not be capitalized in body text unless they are proper nouns  or  adjectives,  or  unless
you are making a literal reference to the title or heading. For example, consider the heading: “Starting the Application  Server.”  It  would  be
correct to write:

In the section “Starting the Application Server,” we discussed the various methods to start the application server.

It is also correct to capitalize literal references to labels on components of a graphical user interface. So  if  there  is  a  button  labeled,
“Click Here to Continue,” it would be correct to write:

When you are finished, click the “Click Here to Continue” button and wait for the next page to appear.

Generally speaking, we treat roles as titles and consider them proper nouns, so it is correct to capitalize terms  such  as  Project  Manager  or
Requirements Analyst.


2 Capitalization of Titles, and Headings

Use headline style when capitalizing a document’s titles and headings. See Chicago §8.167 for the details on headline-style capitalization.


4 Ending Sentences with a Preposition

Despite what your high school teachers told you, it is okay to end a sentence with a preposition.


5 Indefinite Articles before Acronyms

Select the indefinite article (“a” or “an”) before an acronym based on whether the acronym is usually spoken phonetically as a word or spoken  as
a series of letters. For example, the acronym for reduction in force (RIF) is usually spoken as a  word,  so  one  would  write,  “A  RIF  became
necessary when . . .” and not, “An RIF became necessary when . . .” But the acronym for return on investment (ROI) is usually spoken as a  series
of letters, so one would write, “An ROI of 15% is . . .” and not, “A ROI of 15% is . . .”


6 Punctuating Vertical Lists


7 Serial Commas

The comma before the conjunction between the last two elements in a list is known as  a  serial  or  series  comma  (see  Chicago  §6.19).  While
optional, its use is strongly suggested by Chicago, as it can sometimes avoid ambiguity. OPMO documents should always use a serial comma.


8 Space after a Sentence

Put one space after the end of a sentence, not two. Professionally printed books, newspapers, and magazines have one space after  the  end  of  a
sentence (see Chicago §6.11 and §6.13).


9 Trademark Designations

There is no legal requirement to include trademark symbols (® or ™) with  brand  names  (see  Chicago  §8.162).  Leave  them  out,  as  they  are
invariably forgotten in one place or another and lead to inconsistency in the document.

     2 Characteristics of Document Quality

When preparing any document, keep these characteristics of quality in mind to help you produce a high-quality document.

Correctness For this context, the most appropriate Merriam-Webster definition defines correct as conforming to or agreeing with fact,  logic,  or
known truth. Strive to make your documents correct at all levels—from grammar to all aspects of content.

Completeness Again according to Merriam-Webster,  something  is  complete  when  it  has  all  necessary  parts,  elements,  and  steps.  Produce
comprehensive content at the appropriate level of detail.

Consistency A more complex concept than correctness or completeness, we leave it to readers to consult the dictionary themselves. Suffice  it  to
say that consistency, especially consistency of terms, can have a huge impact on reader understanding. It also conveys a sense  of  care  on  the
part of the creators of a document.

Relevance Because of attempts to pass the “weight test,” this quality characteristic is the most often abused. If it is not  important  at  every
level—document, section, paragraph, sentence—to the matter at hand, then leave it out, maybe not entirely, but at least until the point where  it
is appropriate for it to be included. This is key to strong composition.
