SCOPE OF WORK REQUIRMENTS

   1. Project Title:  Access to Proprietary Names Data Resource

   2. Background and Authorization

Since September, 2009, the Medication Errors Staff within the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) was delegated signatory authority
for all proprietary names in the Center for Drug Evaluation & Research for safety acceptability.  In performing this responsibility, the need
for enhanced resources to expedite the performance of several different risk-analyses on the safety of proposed names has been identified.
Specifically, the ability to screen proposed proprietary names across a worldwide collection of high-quality databases, to include registry
files, domain names and pharmaceutical in-use files.   FDA is interested in procuring unlimited access to a data resource that identifies
proprietary names.

The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA,
Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to
ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products. FDA's authority to fund research projects is set out in section 301 of the
Public Health Service Act (PHSA 42 U.S.C. 241).

        Unacceptable in relation to the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.


        •  An EXCELLENT approach demonstrates an outstanding level of insight and understanding of the purpose and objectives. The Offeror shall
        have no deficiencies or significant weaknesses, but may have minimal weaknesses.


        •  A HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE approach demonstrates a high level of insight and understanding of the purpose and objectives.  The Offeror shall
        have no deficiencies and may have one significant weakness, but may have several weaknesses.


        •  An ACCEPTABLE approach demonstrates a moderate level of insight and understanding of the purpose and objectives.  The  Offeror  shall
        have no deficiencies but may have several significant weaknesses.

        Offeror demonstrates multiple significant weaknesses and one deficiency.


        •  An UNACCEPTABLE approach fails to demonstrate any insight or understanding level of insight and  understanding  of  the  purpose  and
        objectives.  The Offeror demonstrates multiple deficiencies and/or significant weaknesses.


        A. Technical Approach: The government shall evaluate the Offeror’s proposal in terms of the responsiveness to the  objectives  described
           in the SOW. This includes the ability to screen proposed proprietary name across a worldwide collection of  high-quality  proprietary
           name database, through a user friendly, transparent and flexible interface to include registry files, domain names  and  Section  508
           compliance.


        B. Management Plan: The Offeror’s technical proposal shall outline an effective plan for providing support throughout the performance of
           this contract, in terms of:
            • Prompt notification of any database down time, loss of data suppliers, or change in management
            • Comprehensive and effective on-site and web-ex training
            • Notification of upgrades, access to upgrades, and appropriate training
            • Provide technical support within 24 hours

        D. Past Performance: By past performance, the government means the Offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and to standards  of
           quality service.  Evaluation of past performance will be based on performance  documentation  and  any  other  pertinent  information
           available.  It will not be based solely on information provided by the Offeror, not on absolute standards of acceptable  performance.
           The government is seeking to determine whether an Offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer  satisfaction
           and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with  each
