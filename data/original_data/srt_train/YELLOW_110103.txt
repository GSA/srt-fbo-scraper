RATING

|Excellent                |The Offeror's past performance far exceeds the customer's expectations and provided significant, unusual     |
|                         |worthwhile features or benefits.                                                                             |
|Satisfactory             |The Offeror's past performance met the customer's expectations and contract requirements                     |

SECTION B:  SUPPLIES OR SERVICES  PRICES/COSTS



Contract Type

This is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period. The Government places orders for individual requirements. The contract requires the Government to order and the contractor to furnish at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or services. In addition, if ordered, the contractor must furnish any additional quantities, not to exceed the stated maximum. The contracting officer has established a reasonable maximum quantity based on trends on recent contracts for similar supplies or services and survey of potential users. 



The contract types and types of orders the government will place against the master contract are:



A firm-fixed-price provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor’s cost experience in performing the contract. This contract type places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides maximum incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum administrative burden upon the contracting parties.



Cost-reimbursement type provides for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. This type establishes an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer (CO).



Delivery-orders call for supplies that specify a firm quantity of supplies for the delivery of supplies during the period of the contract. 



Task-orders call for services that that specify a firm quantity of services for the performance of tasks during the period of the contract. 





Minimum and Maximum Amounts



(a) 	The guaranteed minimum award amount under this contract is $5,000,000.  



(b) 	The maximum amount of funds to be issued against the Master Contract is $95,000,000.  Although the ceiling value is $95,000,000.00 there is no guarantee that the government will place task/delivery orders up to this maximum ceiling.  Presently, the government has estimated requirements up to $40,000,000.00 over the life of the contract.  The additional ceiling value allows for unexpected capacity growth.





Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Structure

The below CLIN structure allows for easy ordering of supplies and services.  The structure found in this section is an illustrative example of a potential CLIN structure.  Offerors are able to propose their own CLIN structure based upon their interpretation of the requirements.  







B.4         Ordering Procedures



(a) 	Any supplies and services to be furnished under the Master Contract shall be ordered by issuance of TO/DOs by the CO. Such orders may be issued during the ordering period of the contract as specified in Section F.1. 

 

(b) 	All TO/DOs are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a TO/DO and this Master Contract, the Master Contract shall take precedence.



(c)	Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.



(d)	The CO is the only authorized individual to place TO/DOs against the master contract.



B.5         Travel and Other Direct Costs

All Other Direct Costs () expenditures by the Contractor shall be pre-approved by the Government.  The FBI CO and COTR will approve individual  requests.  Reimbursement for FBI approved travel will be in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations and Federal Travel Regulations, as an  under CLIN 0010.  Each TO/DO will indicate if travel may be required and shall have a not to exceed (NTE) amount.





SECTION C: DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/ STATEMENT

 

C.1	Scope

This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI's) Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product and services procurement in support of the expansion of the Bureau Investigative Document Management and Analysis System (BIDMAS) II.  

The Contractor shall be responsible for the following:

Furnishing the COTS solution

Identifying the architecture design required to run the solution (for reference, the FBI uses Xeon processors Blade servers, and the CPUs use the Nehalem chipset.  The OS baseline is MS Server 2008 R2 enterprise / Standard Edition X64)

Providing the technical support for the initial installation and configuration

Providing the technical support necessary to migrate current system data/cases to new system

Providing on-call and occasional technical engineering support



C1.1 	Background

FBI investigators acquire large numbers of documents, through subpoenas and voluntary productions, from a number of different sources in various formats.  The documents are reviewed, annotated, categorized, and tracked.  Throughout the duration of a case, the FBI may exchange this data with partner agencies and other parties to the investigation (e.g. defense lawyers).  This requires significant effort in large document-intensive cases.  

The FBI needs to acquire a product that follows elements of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) and has the capability to process, analyze, review and produce Electronically Stored Information (ESI) and present required ESI in litigation and other administrative actions in a timely and efficient manner.  The proposed solution must allow for: 

Efficient processing of data from multiple sources 

Organization of the data in preparation for review and annotation

Easy searching by users 

The facilitation and use of the data by multiple FBI and non-FBI users during the review, discovery and trial phases of a case.  

Traditionally, the FBI performed a majority of this investigative document management manually.  In August 2009, the FBI procured a limited license for a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product from Clearwell Systems.  Since 2009, the pilot implementation of BIDMAS has supported over 38 cases from more than 15 Field divisions.  These cases contain approximately 20 million unique documents.  

The FBI has 56 Field Offices (FOs) and more than 700 additional sites physically distributed across the .  The new BIDMAS II will operate in all 56 FOs within the FBI’s unclassified and classified environments.

The FBI conducts operations across many separate network enclaves which operate at various security levels including unclassified, secret and top secret.  The nature of the operations changes and evolves rapidly due to existing and emerging mission objectives.   As a result, the Government must be able to quickly adapt and deploy IT capabilities in support of the mission.  

Additionally, case investigations and intelligence activities require the Government to collect large quantities of information for analysis and evidence collection.  Many of these investigations can last years with Special Agents and Intelligence Analysts sporadically needing to return to the information for further review or needing augment the information with new data.  These activities require a level of flexibility in the proposed solution. 



Individual cases can vary in size, both in the number of users accessing the solution and data.  Small cases might involve a few users (Special Agents and analysts) and a few gigabytes of raw data, while large cases can involve more than 500 users and many terabytes of raw data.



C.1.2 System Requirements Overview

The COTS solution to be delivered must provide a review and analysis platform to review, tag, and search, ingest, and export large collections of documents and emails.  The tool must be capable of using complex search criteria and advanced search functions (i.e. Boolean, fuzzy, wild card, relational, proximity, etc) on document content, associated metadata, text annotations and structured data all in the same search.  The tool must provide multiple viewing modes giving the user the option to see as much or as little data as wanted.  Users should be able to review documents individually, or review them grouped by context (e.g. by discussion threads or topic clusters).

The solution must allow documents to be accessible on-line while a case is being actively worked; and if archived when inactive, be readily restorable when needed.  Documents will include scanned paper (single or multiple sheets per document) and electronic documents (email of all formats, including GroupWise, Lotus Notes, and Outlook Express; word processing documents; spreadsheets, et al).  The solution must be capable of importing documents in all of these formats and storing/maintaining them in their native formats preserving all metadata.  The formats allowed must include multiple versions, specifically the latest released version.  The solution must also handle Tag Image File (.tiff) formats.  The solution must provide users with the ability for tagging and organization features to mark and organize relevant documents to facilitate analysis, review and retrieval.

The product must also be able to associate new, case-specific structured data fields to the individual documents (e.g. status, keywords, documents designated as exhibits, witnesses associated with the document, etc.).  Users/reviewers must be able to flexibly define and modify what structured data fields are associated with documents for individual cases or sets of documentation within cases.  The tool must provide the ability to record notes and other annotations associated with the individual documents or pages within documents and provide summary reports to monitor case progress, assisting in ensuring that resources are properly allocated.

The contractor will be responsible for all required data migration and BIDMAS pilot system retirement.  This will include all activities (extract, translate, error correction, and load) necessary to migrate legacy data from the existing BIDMAS pilot to the new COTS solution.  The contractor shall verify that no data was lost or corrupted during the migration process.  The contractor shall perform error correction as part of the data migration task, if necessary.  In support of legacy system shutdown, the contractor shall perform all activities necessary to migrate legacy data to include all current work products (e.g. tags, annotations, comments, redactions).

The Contractor will provide a Data Migration Plan.  The plan shall identify the scope of the data migration efforts (e.g., what data will be migrated, the amount of historical data to convert, error correction plan).  Describe the data migration process, to include the roles and responsibilities of participants and the identity of the process owner.  Identify potential risks, verification strategies, migration dependencies, and volume considerations.  Provide specific and measureable criteria for migration success.  Provide a data migration schedule that includes when the data will be captured, converted, verified for correctness and completeness, and available for use in the new solution.

The Contractor shall work with the FBI to establish the system design including the hardware and software required to deploy the system field-wide throughout the FBI.  The proposal shall include technical staff support to cover the installation, configuration, data migration, user training and operations and maintenance support.

Requirements must be met by one comprehensive Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution which provides all required functionality.  The solution must be a seamless, integrated complete solution.  

It is important to note that this requirement will encompass multiple installations across classified and unclassified networks as well as for multiple FBI divisions. The number of installations may increase with expanded capacity based upon your proposal.

Classified Contract Special Security Requirement (SSR)





The FBI has determined that performance of this effort requires that the Contractor have access to classified National Security Information (herein known as classified information).  Classified information is Government information which requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12356, Classified National Security Information, and supplementing directives.  Executive Order 13292, dated 28 March 2003, “Further Amendment to Executive Order 12356, as amended, “Classified National Security Information” and implementation directives, provides principles and procedures for the proper classification and declassification of material.  These principles and procedures are applicable to classified documents or materials generated by the contractor in performance of this contract. 



This clause applies to the extent that this contract involves access to information classified (select either “Confidential”, “Secret” or “Top Secret”).



The contractor shall comply with:  



	(1) The Security Agreement (DD Form 441), including the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) 



	(2) Any revisions to that manual, notice of which has been furnished to the contractor.  



 The Contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254 and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5200.22-M) for the protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the .  If the Contractor has access to classified information at a FBI or other Government facility, it shall abide by the requirements set by the agency.



No classified document or material provided by the FBI, or generated by the contractor pursuant to the contract, may be downgraded or declassified unless authorized in writing by the CO.



The Contractor shall appoint a senior official to act as the Corporate Security Officer.  The individual shall interface with the FBI Security Office on all security matters, to include physical, personnel and protection of all Government information and data accessed by the Contractor.



Contractor personnel will require access to classified information and have access to classified areas.  Contractor personnel shall possess at least an active and transferable Government Secret clearance at the time of proposal submission.  Contractors who will have access to FBI facilities, systems or data shall possess an active and transferable Top Secret clearance at the time of proposal submission.  The Government reserves the right to waive this requirement for any portion of the work that deals with technologies or data that is in the public domain.  Contractor personnel assigned to this project shall be subject to routine criminal and credit checks by the FBI.



Contractor personnel shall be subject to counterintelligence focused polygraph examinations at the Government's discretion.  The polygraph examinations may be required prior to acceptance or at any time during the task order, without notice.



The contractor shall maintain an overall security program in accordance with the requirements of the NISP.  All automated information systems utilized to process FBI information will be operated in accordance with the requirements of the NISPOM, NISPOM Supplement, dated February 1995, DCID 6/3 and/or FBI certification and accreditation policies and procedures, as appropriate.  Revisions to these documents, when published, will be provided to the contractor and will become a part hereof upon such issuance.



If subsequent to the date of this contract, the security classification or security requirements under this contract are caused to be changed by the Government and if the changes cause an increase or decrease in security costs or otherwise affect any other term or condition of this contract, the contract shall be subject to an equitable adjustment as if the changes were directed under the Changes clause of this contract.



The contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph, but excluding any reference to the Changes clause of this contract, in all subcontracts under this contract that involve access to classified information.



The contractor is obligated to comply with all relevant clauses and provisions incorporated into this contract and with the Contractor NonDisclosure Agreement, and as referenced therein, the NISPOM, dated January 1995, and all applicable FBI security policies and procedures, including the DCIDs.  As applicable, the contractor shall maintain a security program that meets the requirements of these documents.



Security requirements are a material conduction of this contract.  This contract shall be subject to immediate termination for default, without the requirement for a 10-day cure notice, when it has been determined by the CO that a failure to fully comply with the security requirements of this contract resulted from the willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of any one of the Contractor’s directors or officers, or on the part of any of the managers, superintendents, or equivalents of the contractor who have supervision or direction of:



	a.  All or substantially all of the contractor’s business, or



	b.  All or substantially all of the contractor’s operations at any one plant or separate location in which this contract is being performed, or



	c.  A separate and complete major industrial operation in connection with the performance of this contract.



When deficiencies in the contractor’s security program are noted which do not warrant immediate default, the contractor shall be provided a written notice of the deficiencies and be given a period of 90 days in which to take corrective action.  If the contractor fails to take the necessary corrective action, the CO may terminate the whole or any part of this contract, for default.  The contractor shall maintain and administer, in accordance with all relevant clauses and provisions set forth or incorporated into this contract, a security program that meets the requirements of these documents.





Clauses for Contracts Involving Access to Classified Information



The Government intends to secure services or equipment from firms which are not deemed to be an acquisition risk.  The Government reserves the right to contract with such Offerors under appropriate arrangements, when it determines that such contract will be in the best interest of the Government.



Accordingly, all Offerors responding to this proposal or initiating performance of a contract are required to answer the acquisition risk questions located in Section K.  All answers are to be reflective of the parent and subsidiary levels of an organization. Offerors are also required to request, collect, and forward to the Government answers to these acquisition risk questions from all subcontractors undertaking classified work under the Offeror's direction and control.  Offerors are responsible for the thoroughness and completeness of each subcontractor's submission.  Responses should specify, where necessary, the identity, nature, degree, and impact of any Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) on their organization or activities, or the organization or activities of a subcontractor.  Additionally, a Key Management Personnel Listing (KMPL) must be submitted for each entity for which acquisition risk information is required.  The KMPL must identify senior management by full legal name, position, social security number, date/place of birth, and citizenship status.



The Offeror shall, in any case in which it believes that foreign influence exists or is being sought over its affairs, or the affairs of any subcontractor, promptly notify the Contracting Officer's Security Representative of all pertinent facts.



The Selected Offeror shall promptly disclose to the Contracting Officer's Security Representative any information pertaining to any interest of a FOCI nature in the Selected Offeror or subcontractor that has developed at any time during the Selected Offeror's duration or has subsequently come to the Selected Offeror's attention.  Written notification to the Contracting Officer is required of the Selected Offeror or any subcontractor whenever there is a change in response to any of the acquisition risk questions.



The Offeror is responsible for initiating the submission of the required risk acquisition information and KMPL for all subcontractors undertaking classified work during the entire period of performance of the contract.  Failure to comply shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract.



In Section K, Offerors shall complete the Acquisition Risk Questions and Key Management Personnel Listing (KMPL) for the prime contractor and all proposed subcontractors.  Provision of false information shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract.



The information in Section K regarding Key Management Personnel, which may identify U.S. persons, is being requested pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, and Director of Central Intelligence Directive 7/6, Community Acquisition Risk Center, or superseding Acts or Directives.  The FBI will use this information to conduct the acquisition risk determination and may share the information internally and externally with members of the Intelligence Community and other U.S. Government entities, if necessary, consistent with appropriate routine uses for its Central Records System (), Justice/FBI-002, last published in full in the Federal Register on February 20, 1998 (63 Fed. Reg. 8671), or any updates thereto. In the absence of proof of death of any of the Key Management Personnel, their consent, or an overriding public interest, the information will not otherwise be disseminated except pursuant to the routine uses for the .

The Government reserves the right to prohibit individuals who are not U.S. citizens from all or certain aspects of the work to be performed under this Contract.

 

Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) - For purposes of this clause, a U.S. company is considered under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company's securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company.



Changed conditions, such as change in ownership, indebtedness, or the foreign intelligence threat, may justify certain adjustments to the security terms under which a company is operating, or, alternatively, that different acquisition risk mitigation measures be employed.  If a changed condition is of sufficient significance, it might also result in a determination that a company is no longer considered to be an acquisition risk.  There is a continuing obligation of the Selected Offeror to advise the Government of such changed conditions.  Failure to abide by this obligation shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract.



Factors:  The following factors will be used as the basis for making an acquisition risk determination.  If the Offeror, or its proposed subcontractors, meet any of the following factors, they must identify themselves as a potential FOCI company and submit themselves for a Government acquisition risk evaluation and assessment:



(1)  Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of 5 percent or more of the Offeror's company's voting securities by a foreign person.



(2)  Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of 25 percent or more of any class of the Offeror's company's non- voting securities by a foreign person.



(3)  Management positions, such as directors, officers, or executive personnel of the Offeror's company held by non-U.S. citizens.



(4)  Foreign person power, direct or indirect, to control the election, appointment, or tenure of directors, officers, or executive personnel of the Offeror's company or other decisions or activities of the Offeror's company.



(5)  Contracts, agreements, understandings, or arrangements between the Offeror's company and a foreign person.



(6)  Loan arrangements between the Offeror's company and a foreign person if the Offeror's company's (the borrower) overall debt to equity ratio is 40:60 or greater; or financial obligations that are subject to the ability of a foreign person to demand repayment.



(7)  Annual total revenues or net income in excess of 5 percent from a single foreign person or in excess of 30 percent from foreign persons in the aggregate.

 

(8)  Ten percent or more of any class of the Offeror's voting securities held in "nominee shares", in "street names", or in some other method that does not disclose the beneficial ownership of equitable title.



(9)  Interlocking directors with foreign persons and any officer or management official of the Offeror's company who is also employed by a foreign person.



(10)  Any other factor that indicates or demonstrates a capability on the part of foreign persons to control or influence the operations or management of the Offeror's company.



(11)  Ownership of 10 percent or more of any foreign interest.



Every effort must be made to ensure that supplies are provided and integrated and services are performed using sound security components, practices, and procedures.  Acquisition of supplies or services from concerns under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) or of supplies developed, manufactured, maintained, or modified by concerns under FOCI (any or all of which shall be referred to herein as "Use of FOCI source") is of serious concern and must be approved prior to contract award and evaluated during contract performance.  Approval decisions will be made on a case by case basis after the source or technology has been identified by the Offeror and subjected to a risk assessment.



Any Offeror responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Sealed Bid acknowledges the Government's requirements to secure services or equipment from firms which are not an acquisition risk; are not under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI); or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on National Security or security requirements.  The Offeror understands and agrees that the Government retains the right to reject any response to this RFP, RFQ, or Sealed Bid made by the Offeror, without any further recourse by or explanation to the Offeror, if the acquisition risk for that Offeror is determined by the Government to be an unacceptable security risk.



The risk assessment process will vary depending on the acquisition type and proposed use of a FOCI source, available risk mitigation measures, and the information/justification provided by the Offeror.



Risk assessments will be on a case by case basis and will be used to determine whether the use of a FOCI source poses an unacceptable security risk.  If an unacceptable security risk is determined, the Government retains the right to reject the use of a FOCI source or to require that certain risk mitigation measures be taken by the contractor.  Similarly, the Government retains the unilateral right to approve the use of a FOCI source when the risk assessment indicates that such use would be in the Governments' best interests.  If the use of a FOCI source is not approved, no classified information will be disclosed to the Offeror as part of the Government's rationale for non approval.  The Offeror (prime and subs) may not seek reimbursement from the Government for any costs associated with responding to this RFP, RFQ, or Sealed Bid, as a result of a FOCI nonapproval decision.

Contracting Officer's Security Representative Clause



Contracting Officer's Security Representatives (COSR) are the designated security representatives of the Contracting Officer and derive their authorities directly from the Contracting Officer.  They are responsible for certifying the contractor's capability for handling classified material and ensuring that customer security policies and procedures are met.  The COSR is the focal point for the contractor, Contracting Officer, and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative regarding security issues.  The COSR cannot initiate any course of action that may alter the terms or price/cost of the contract.  The COSR for this contract is Joann Saunders and can be reached on (202) 2209230.



Requirements for Procurement of Critical Assets



Every effort must be made to ensure that supplies are provided and integrated and services are performed using sound security components, practices, and procedures.  Acquisition of supplies or services from concerns under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) or of supplies developed, manufactured, maintained, or modified by concerns under FOCI (any or all of which shall be referred to herein as "Use of FOCI source") is of serious concern and must be approved prior to contract award.  Approval decisions will be made on a case by case basis after the source or technology has been identified by the Offeror and subjected to a risk assessment.



The risk assessment process will vary depending on the acquisition type and proposed use of a FOCI source, available risk mitigation measures, and the information/justification provided by the Offeror.



Any Offeror responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Sealed Bid acknowledges the Government's requirements to secure services or equipment from firms which are not under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI), or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on National Security or security requirements.  The Offeror understands and agrees that the Government retains the right to reject any response to this RFP, RFQ, or Sealed Bid made by the Offeror, without any further recourse by or explanation to the Offeror, if the FOCI for that Offeror is determined by the Government to be an unacceptable security risk.



Risk assessments will be on a case by case basis and will be used to determine whether the use of a FOCI source poses an unacceptable security risk.  If an unacceptable security risk is determined, the Government retains the right to reject the use of a FOCI source or to require that certain risk mitigation measures be taken by the Offeror.  Similarly, the Government retains the unilateral right to approve the use of a FOCI source when the risk assessment indicates that such use would be in the Governments' best interests.  If the use of a FOCI source is not approved, no classified information will be disclosed to the Offeror as part of the Government's rationale for non approval.  The Offeror (prime and subs) may not seek reimbursement from the Government for any costs associated with responding to this RFP, RFQ or Sealed Bid, as a result of a FOCI nonapproval decision.



In Section K, Offerors shall complete the Acquisition Risk Questions and Key Management Personnel Listing (KMPL) for the prime contractor and all proposed subcontractors.  Provision of false information shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract.



The information in Section K regarding Key Management Personnel, which may identify U.S. persons, is being requested pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, Executive Order 12829, National Industrial Security Program, and Director of Central Intelligence Directive 7/6, Community Acquisition Risk Center, or superseding Acts, Orders or Directives.

Reg. 8671), or any updates thereto. In the absence of proof of death of any of the Key Management Personnel, their consent, or an overriding public interest, the information will not otherwise be disseminated except pursuant to the routine uses for the .



The Government reserves the right to prohibit individuals who are not U.S. citizens from all or certain aspects of the work to be performed under this Contract.

 

Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI)   For purposes of this clause, a U.S. company is considered under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company's securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company.

Access to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Locations



Performance under this contract may require access to FBI locations to provide some service, product, or perform some other official function of interest to the FBI.  Requirements, as identified below, to include approval by the FBI's Security Division, must be satisfied prior to access. 



Contractors who will require escorted access, to include short-term, intermittent, or infrequent access, to an FBI facility must complete an "Access of Non-FBI Personnel to FBI Facilities, Background Data Information Form," (FD 816), a "Privacy Act of 1974 Acknowledgment Form" (FD 484) and two Fingerprint Cards (FD 258).  Completed forms should be provided to the assigned Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) at least 10 days prior to required access.



Individuals requiring unescorted access to an FBI facility must complete the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions, using the Office of Personnel Management’s Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) and provide two Fingerprint Cards (FD 258).  e-QIP is a secure website that can be accessed from any computer system which has an Internet connection.  Only the signed release forms and FD 258 will need to be mailed to the identified Chief Security Officer, the SF-86 itself will be transmitted to the FBI electronically. 



To complete the SF-86 using e-QIP, the individual requiring unescorted access to the FBI facility must contact (insert Chief Security Officer, Division, and telephone number) in order to be initiated into e-QIP.  Once this action has been accomplished, the individual should be able to access e-QIP at the following link in order to initiate and complete the electronic process:  http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/browser-check.asp.  Thoroughly read and follow the instructions for completing the SF-86.  NOTE:  To fully address suitability/security issues, the FBI requires individuals to provide responses to questions on the SF-86 for the last ten years.  Failure to complete the application as instructed may lead to significant delays in processing the required investigation and approval for unescorted access.  

Upon logging onto e-QIP, there will be a prompt to answer three “Golden” security questions to establish the user account.   After completing the electronic SF-86, please print and sign the (1) Certification Form (CER) - Certify Completeness and Accuracy of your Investigation Request; (2) Medical Release Form () - Authorization for Release of Medical Information; and (3) Release Form () - Authorization for Release of Information.  In addition to these SF 86 release forms, the completion of a Non-Personnel Consent to Release Information (FD-979a), the United States Department of Justice Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports (DOJ 555) are required.  Annotation of the assigned e-QIP Investigation Request Number on the upper right corner of each document transmitted to the identified Chief Security Officer is required for coordination with the electronic transmission and to facilitate the investigative process.  The e-QIP Investigation Request Number, automatically generated by e-QIP, is located on both the header and footer of the signature forms.  These release forms (five total) and FD 258 should be mailed via Federal Express or  Express mail directly to the following address:  (insert name and address of Chief Security Officer).  The use of regular U.S. mail channels may cause significant delays in processing the unescorted access request. 



Upon completion of processing the facility access request, the individual will be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement suitable for their approved access.

In such cases, the contractor shall notify the individuals until it receives further instruction from the Department.





Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice Workplaces



All cleared personnel accessing information within FBI controlled space are required to execute an FBI Form FD 1001 Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces as a condition of working at FBI facilities.  The FBI's Director implemented the Attorney General's policy subjecting employees to warrantless physical searches of their offices or immediate workplaces within DOJ premises when authorized by the Attorney General (AG) or the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) based upon a determination that information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee:



	1) is, or may be, disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner;



2) has incurred excessive indebtedness or has acquired a level of affluence that cannot be reasonably explained by other information;



3) had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that is believed to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or



	4) has repeatedly or significantly mishandled or improperly stored classified information.



The search may extend to the entire office or workplace and anything within it that might hold classified information, including locked containers (such as briefcases) and electronic storage media (such as computer disk and handheld computers), whether owned by the government, by the employee, or by a third party.  The search may be conducted by appropriate FBI personnel and/or law enforcement officers, on an announced or unannounced basis, during the workday or after hours.  If discovered during a search, evidence of misconduct - whether related to storage or classified information, storage of sensitive but unclassified information, or a crime - will be collected and reported to appropriate authorities.



Contractor personnel who will meet the above criteria will be required to sign Form FD 1001 Consent for Warrantless Searches of  Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces (attached) upon award and forward the executed form(s) to the assigned Contracting Officer's Technical Representative designated in Section G of the solicitation if this is a formal solicitation or listed below.  All forms will be retained by the FBI during the period the individual is providing services and two years after that individual's departure before final disposition is taken.





Personnel Security Requirements



The administrative control and maintenance of accurate records of contractors has been identified by both the Intelligence Community and FBI Executive Management as a matter of concern.  With the continuous dependency on contractors to support the FBI, to include access to FBI facilities and information, if a procurement is expected to result in the acquisition of services  involving the assignment of contractor personnel to FBI locations the Program Management Officer/Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), in coordination with the assigned Chief Security Officer, are required to identify during procurement planning stages, whether an acquisition will require assignment of contractor personnel to FBI locations, and therefore require the anticipated contract to include the Special Security Clause identified below in 1.2.



 Security Requirements  Applicable to Contractor Personnel Assigned to FBI Locations



Requirements are applicable to all individuals to be assigned to FBI locations, to include those identified as "Key Personnel", if specified in the contract.  The contractor shall plan for expected attrition through advanced preparation and submission of required information.



Award of this contract is anticipated to result in assignment of contractor personnel to FBI controlled or occupied space.    Security  and ethical conduct requirements, specific to the contract, to include a copy of the "Contractor & FBI Employees Ethics Standards Factsheet" are provided.   Any questions that the contractor or contractor personnel may have on the applicability of these requirements shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer's Security Representative or (name of Chief Security Officer), Chief Security Officer, at (telephone number). As such, all contractor personnel assigned to such space must be briefed, in advance of arrival, by the contractor on the provided FBI policies and procedures, as identified in the contract, regarding ethical conduct and security requirements.  A list of assigned Contractor personnel and verification of their briefing, shall be provided to the cognizant contractor security officer for subsequent transmittal to the proper FBI Security Officer assigned oversight of this contract.   This list must be provided no later than seven  (7) days in advance of the individual's scheduled date of initial performance at an FBI location.  Failure to provide the required verification of briefing will result in a delay of the individual's access to the facility.

Additionally, within 15 days from assignment to FBI space, the employee must attend an FBI Security Awareness Briefing, which will further address FBI policies and procedures, as identified in FBI's Policy and Guidance Library.  This training is currently satisfied through the contractor employee's attendance  at the Security Division's Career Services Management Unit's quarterly contractor's training offered at FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC.  The assigned FBI Chief Security Officer will contact the employee with the date and time of their scheduled briefing.  Failure to attend this briefing or make arrangements  to attend a subsequent briefing will result in immediate removal of the employee from FBI space.  If contract performance is impacted as a result of removal of the employee, the contractor may be found in default of the contract.  In the event that the development of information or material is not clearly covered by the contract or regulations, the contractor is required to seek FBI guidance regarding its handling of classified and/or unclassified information.



Only such persons who have been authorized by the Contracting Officer and/or the Chief Security Officer/Contracting Officer's Security Representative, if the work is for other than specified personnel, shall be assigned to this work.  In this connection, for identification purposes, the contractor will be required to submit the name, address, place and date of birth of all personnel who will be involved in the work hereunder.  Said information will be required to be provided to the identified Chief Security Officer not later than seven (7) days in advance of the scheduled date of such work.  Information relating to an individual(s) identified as "Key Personnel" should be reported to the Chief Security Officer after the written consent of the Contracting Officer has been received.  



All contractor personnel who receive a security clearance or access approval under the terms of this contract will be required to execute a FBI specified  nondisclosure agreement.



The contractor agrees to abide by all applicable FBI security regulations governing personnel, facilities, technical, information systems, communications and protective programs.



The following reporting requirements are to be reported to the identified Chief Security Officer as promptly as possible, but in no event later than two (2) business days after receipt of such knowledge.



a.  Adverse Information.  Contractors shall report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning any of their employees supporting this contract.  Adverse information is defined as any information that adversely reflect on the integrity or character of an employee that suggests that his or her ability to safeguard FBI Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU)/Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) and/or classified information may be impaired, or that his or her access to the information clearly may not be in the interest of the FBI and/or National Security.



b.  Suspicious Contacts.  Contractors shall report efforts by any individual, regardless of nationality, to obtain illegal or unauthorized access to FBI SBU/LES or classified information or to compromise an employee.  



c.  Change in Employee Status.  Contractors shall report (1) the death, (2) a name change, (3) change in marital status, (4) change to performance which alters their originally assigned location and FBI Division to which they report, (5) termination of employment.



d.  Employees Desiring Not to Perform on the Contract.  Evidence that an employee no longer wishes to support the contract.



f.  Official or Unofficial Foreign Travel.

Contractor Suitability Requirement



Background:  With increasing frequency, contractors are applying for permanent positions with the FBI.  As part of the applicant background process for these contractors, now government applicants, these individuals are subjected to full-scope polygraph examinations.  Inevitably, certain applicants fail the polygraph examination.

H.11.1 Contractor Suitability SSR



Access to FBI facilities and information is subject to specific security and suitability requirements.  The FBI reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict  facility and information access of any contractor employee determined by the FBI, at any time during performance, to be unsuitable for access and/or present a risk of compromising sensitive government information to which he or she would have access to under this contract.    Contractors will be allotted a reasonable amount of time, determined by the government, to replace the employee found not suitable for continued contract performance.  Failure to replace the employee may result in a no cost termination for cause by the government





DOJ Residency Requirement

For three of the five years immediately prior to applying for the specific contract position, the individual must have 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capability; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.



The requirement may be waived for short term contractor personnel (performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized and unique skills.  These individuals must, however, be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens.  





H.13        Non-Disclosure and Conflicts of Interest

Under the scope of this contract, Contractor personnel may come in contact with extremely sensitive data.  The Contractor shall ensure that this information is not communicated, transmitted or otherwise divulged except on a need-to-know basis during the conduct of official Government business.

K.4	52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) 



(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that— 

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals— 

(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see , if included in this solicitation); 

(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 

(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(2) Examples. 

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 

(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 

(2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

For the primary business unit proposing to provide the services solicited, list any contract that was terminated for the convenience of the Government within the last three years and any contract that was terminated for default by the Government within the past three years.  Explain the circumstances in each instance.



The Government intends to utilize a past performance questionnaire (see Attachment 4) to obtain first hand information from references provided by the Offeror.



Offerors with no record of relevant past performance or for whom past performance is not available, must submit a signed and dated statement to that effect.





L.3.1.5 Required Content Volume V – Price

Page Limit: None



No price information shall appear in any other volume of the proposal submission. 



The pricing volume shall contain two parts.   The bulk of the volume should address the different pricing scenarios set forth in the pricing template (Attachment 5), and in accordance with meeting the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work (Section C of the RFP).  Appendix A of the Pricing Volume shall contain the Offeror’s proposed price for completing TO #1.  The Offeror shall utilize the pricing template worksheets, which are found as Attachment 5 when building its cost proposals for both Volume V and its Appendix A.  Appendix A of the Price Volume shall contain only the pricing and assumptions associated with TO #1, as stated in Attachment 3.  Offerors shall provide pricing for the base year and the four one-year option periods.  The government seeks cumulative price discounts from the first order throughout the contract period.  This means that from the first awarded task order the government expects to retain the level of quantity discount price breaks for future tasks orders.



This component of evaluation addresses the potential for an expanded user base and storage capacity.  In addition, Offerors shall specify the impact on pricing if there is more than one installation of the proposed solution, i.e., two or more separately managed systems.   There may be more than one installation of BIDMAS II to support case investigations and discovery in the classified and unclassified environments.



The additional capacity level pricing shall assume all other variables are kept constant unless otherwise expressly stated. If additional storage is necessary with additional users, please note that in your user escalations. The Offeror will also state any significant pricing milestones (ex. an additional piece of equipment is needed at X TB of storage). If no changes in pricing occur at stated capacities, please clearly state that all labor hours, labor rates, and bill of materials are the same as another designated capacity level.  The price proposal shall provide fully burdened hourly rates at the government site and at the contractor’s site.



All assumptions and deviations made by the Offeror in preparing their price proposals must be expressly stated.



The proposal shall also address any warranty (whether express or implied) terms, period and conditions for any hardware, supplies, materials, etc. on the contract.



L.3.1.5.1 Required Content TO 1– Price (to be included in Volume V as an appendix)

Page Limit: None



Offerors shall submit a price proposal that provides a price summary of the individual items requested in the TO #1.  TO #1 contains the base requirements of 500 users and 30 terabytes of storage. Offerors shall propose a price proposal by completing the attached pricing template.

L.5 Segregation of  

Ensure that all pricing data is included only in Volume IV of the proposal, both for the initial submission and for any subsequent revisions.  No cost or pricing data shall appear in any other volume of the proposal as this may compromise the integrity of the evaluation.




SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



M.1 BASIS OF AWARD



The Government will award a contract  to the Offeror providing the best overall value to the Government.  The Government expects to award one contract based on this solicitation.  The Government will base its determination on a price/technical tradeoff analysis of the quantifiable strengths, weaknesses, risks and prices of the proposals.  Offerors with an overall rating of “Unacceptable, Fail or Red” will be ineligible for award.  In the case where the factors are assigned similar evaluation scores, the price factor becomes more important. The proposals submitted shall meet the validation requirements stated in the solicitation and each Offeror must be considered responsive.   The Offeror must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9.104-1.In conducting the evaluation of proposals, the FBI reserves the right to utilize all information available at time of evaluations.  The FBI may rely on information contained in its own records, commercial sources, and information publicly available for evaluation purposes.  



The Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial offers received, without discussion of such offers in accordance with the provisions of FAR 15.306.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms from a price and product/services stand point.  It is the government’s intent to award a single contract however we reserve the right to select more than one (1) Offeror.  The government also reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted, the availability of funds, and other factors.  





M.2 RECEIPT  Validation of Proposals  



All proposals shall be submitted to the CO in their entirety.  Proposals will be logged by time and date received.  Any proposals received after the required submission time are considered late and shall not be reviewed or considered for award. 

An initial validation of all proposals received will be conducted before they are distributed for evaluation, to ensure that the requirements for format, content, page limits and specified pass/fail criteria established in the solicitation have been met.  The results of the validation process may be considered during the proposal evaluation, and subsequent best value analysis.  Any Offeror submitting a proposal that is deemed non-responsive will be notified in writing.



M.3  Award on Initial Proposals

The Government intends to award this effort based on the initial offers received, without discussion of such offers in accordance with the provisions of FAR 15.306.  Accordingly, each initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms from a price and services stand point which the Offeror can submit to the Government.  The Government may select more than one (1) Offeror for this effort.  However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted, the availability of funds, and other factors.  



M.4  EVALUATION

This is a Best Value acquisition. The Best Value determination will be reached by comparing the differences in the value of the technical proposal with the differences in the price proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior products/services than lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only slightly superior service.  Overall price to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of the contract as proposals are deemed to be increasingly equal based on other factors.



M.5 SCORING/Weighting Methodologies



Weighting of the Factors and Sub Factors is as follows:



Security and Organizational Conflicts of Interest will be rated as pass/fail.  



Technical and Past Performance will be evaluated by use of a color-coded/adjective system supported by a narrative rating. 



Price will be evaluated but not scored.



The Technical Factor is more important than Past Performance and Price combined.



Within the Technical Factor Sub Factors T-1 and T-2 are equally important.  T-1 and T-2 combined are more important than T-3 and T-4.  Sub Factor T-3 is more important than T-4. 



Past Performance is more important than Price.



Within the Past Performance Factor, Sub Factors P-1 and P-2 are equally important.



Price becomes more important as proposals are deemed to be increasingly equal based on the other factors. With regards to the price evaluation, the amount of capacity is more important than the number of users.





M.6 Technical AND PAST PERFORMANCE Adjectival RatingS



The following standard color scheme will be used for the technical aspects of proposals, illustrating to what degree each proposal meets, exceeds, or fails the evaluation standards.

Blue – exceptional – virtually no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the proposed effort.  The Offeror’s understanding of the project and soundness of approach are such that virtually no Government intervention is expected to be required in achieving the proposed level of performance.  No clarification is needed, and there are no significant ambiguities noted in any rated area.

Green – acceptable - evaluated with a certainty, that the Offeror will successfully perform the proposed effort.  The Offeror’s understanding of the project and soundness of approach are such that little Government intervention is expected to be required in achieving the proposed level of performance.  Minor ambiguities may be noted, but can be addressed through reasonable interpretation of the Offeror’s proposal.

Yellow – marginal – substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the proposed effort.  The Offeror’s understanding of the project and soundness of approach are such that substantial Government intervention is expected to be able to meet the proposed level of performance.  Major ambiguities may be noted, but can be addressed through reasonable interpretation of the Offeror’s proposal.

Red – unacceptable – extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the proposed effort.  The Offeror’s understanding of the project and soundness of approach is such that, regardless of the degree of Government intervention, successful performance as proposed is extremely doubtful.  There are major ambiguities noted.  Proposal contains ambiguities to the extent that criteria requirements can only be met with major revisions to the proposal.



The Past Performance Factor alone will include the following additional color category:

Neutral/White – No relevant past performance for evaluation.  A thorough search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information (see FAR 15.305).  This is a neutral rating. It does not hinder nor help the Offeror.  If a score of White is assigned for past performance, this rating will have no impact, positive or negative, on the proposal’s overall score.



M.7  Offeror Questions 



All questions from Offerors must be in accordance with Section L.4.  Every attempt shall be made to respond expeditiously citing the pertinent information from the solicitation.  All Offerors will receive both the questions and the answers from all other offerors to ensure all are equally informed.

  



M.8 Technical Evaluation 



To be considered acceptable the proposed system must meet the stated mandatory requirements . The technical evaluation used for Offeror selection will be based on the following sub-factors, and will take into account Volume III in its entirety (i.e. including Appendix A):

Sub-Factor T-1: Understanding the Requirements/Ability to Meet the Requirements: The Offeror will be evaluated on their demonstrated clear understanding of the requirements set forth in the Section C of the solicitation, as well as their proposed solution’s ability to meet all of the stated mandatory requirements. Any proposed system that does not meet the stated mandatory requirements will not be considered an acceptable solution.  



Sub-Factor T-2: Technical Approach: The Offeror will be evaluated on their demonstrated clear understanding and approach to: 

Develop and deliver a large scale document analysis capability in a rapid and efficient manner

Provide a solution which can ingest large quantities of data in an efficient manner

Provide a capability which supports the rapid analysis of cases containing large volumes of documents and many users

Provide a solution which easily scales in both users and data sufficient to support both large and small cases

Migrate data from the legacy system to the proposed solution

Sub-Factor T-3: Personnel:  The Offeror will be evaluated on the strength of the Personnel resumes submitted.  The Offeror shall provide resumes for all key positions, and the Offeror has the flexibility to designate positions as Key Personnel as they see fit.  Each resume shall be limited in length to two (2) pages.  Personnel will be evaluated as to their ability to fulfill the tasks expected of them taking into consideration past, relevant job experience including experience with any COTS products being proposed, professional education, specific accomplishments and other relevant factors such as availability.  All personnel proposed to work on site at FBI locations will be required to obtain and maintain a current, active Top Secret security clearance.  Due to the investigative urgency of this effort, the Government will rate proposals which include already cleared personnel higher than proposals that include personnel who have not yet obtained a clearance.



Sub-Factor T-4: Management Plan: The ability to initiate, manage, and fulfill the contract requirements.  The Government will evaluate Offeror’s on their overall management approach, such as planned management of the project and responsiveness to customer needs, but also on the following specific criteria.

Staffing Plan.  The Offeror will be evaluated on their demonstrated ability to staff the requirement with cleared personnel, provide reach-back capability to accommodate surge in work requirements and quick reaction to fill vacant positions.  The Offeror must provide actual resumes and identify current security clearances held for each individual proposed.  All Key Personnel must sign and submit a letter of intent to work on this effort should that Offeror be selected as the winner.  The Offeror must also propose a staffing transition plan that details timeframes and procedures for replacing personnel who have departed or been removed from the project. 





M.9 Security Evaluation



Security is a criterion in the evaluation of proposals received in response to this solicitation.  The Security Proposal will be evaluated as pass/fail.  Failure to receive a passing evaluation will disqualify the proposal package from the procurement.  The security evaluation will include reviews of the following:



a.  The contractor's security processes for personnel security, including management of clearances;



b.  The contractor's practices for access to, control of, and storage of classified material;



c.  How these processes and procedures will be applied to the requirements of this proposal;



d.  The contractor's cleared facilities that will be dedicated to this program including date of certification, Cage Code, and Cognizant Security Agency.



e.  The contractor’s willingness to participate in the Contractor Polygraph Program.



f.   Description of the assumptions on which the contractor based the security proposal.





M.10	Past Performance Evaluation

Past Performance of the Offeror will be evaluated to determine the Offeror’s record of providing services to commercial and government customers.  The Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the offeror.  This information may be used for the evaluation of past performance. The Offeror’s past performance will be evaluated based on the following sub-factors:



Sub-Factor P-1: Relevance of Experience:  The Offeror’s experience shall be evaluated on the degree of relevancy to requirements of the solicitation on the basis of similarity in size, scope, complexity, technical difficulty, contract type, and period of performance.  Knowledge of current FBI processes and systems is preferable.  Recent experience (defined as gained in the last five years) will be evaluated.  The government reserves the right to use past performance information not submitted by the Offeror, including the use of a past performance questionnaire to gain firsthand accounts of the Offeror’s performance.



Sub-Factor P-2: Quality of Product of Service:  This factor assesses the Offeror’s past performance to determine its ability to provide quality product or services.  The quality of the Offeror’s past performance shall be evaluated on the basis of information contained in the Offeror’s proposal and information that the government obtains through reference checks or other means.  Past performance evaluation shall assess the Offeror’s record of providing high quality services of a similar nature in a manner that ensures maximum accuracy, throughput, cost effectiveness and overall client satisfaction.  The assessment of this sub factor will be based on evaluation of the following components: 

Timeliness of Performance.  This component assesses the Offeror’s ability to provide requested services in a timely manner (i.e., met interim milestones, reliable, responsible to technical direction, completed on time, including contract administration).

Cost Control.  This component assesses the Offeror’s ability to complete contracts within the established cost range (i.e., within budget, current accurate and complete billings).

Customer Satisfaction. This component assesses the Offeror’s ability to satisfy the needs of the customer in all facets of operations (i.e., satisfaction of end users with the contractor’s service).



Past performance information will be submitted by the Offeror, but will also be collected through government interviews with previous customers, (POC information to be provided by the Offeror).  The government may consider additional inputs as well, to include but not limited to the information found in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS):  .  





M.11   Price Evaluation



Price will be evaluated but not rated or scored. The price evaluation will include a review of Volume V in its entirety (i.e. including Appendix A). The evaluators shall conduct a price analysis . The evaluation shall take into account price reasonableness, risk, and realistic. 



The price evaluation shall consist of two components.  The first component is an evaluation of the pricing offered for the first TO under this contract, which includes 1,000 users and 30 terabytes of storage (Appendix A to Volume V). 



The second component will include an evaluation of the overall pricing model based on multiple combinations of the scenarios set forth in the pricing template.  For instance, the Government may choose to evaluate the Offeror’s price based on 1,000 users and10TB of capacity, or other such combination of pricing information as outlined in the pricing attachment.  The government may randomly select points within the pricing worksheet to determine which offeror is providing the best value (maximum number of storage capacity with a reasonable amount of concurrent users at the best cost).  With regards to the price evaluation, the amount of capacity is more important than the number of users. The FBI is seeking to obtain the most capacity possible to serve as many investigations as possible with access for a reasonable number of users given the available capacity. For purposes of defining a reasonable number of users, the minimum expected number of users is 1,000, and the maximum number of users is 10,000.



The government will evaluate proposals that provide the best value as it relates to cumulative price discounts throughout the life of the contract from the initial purchase.  This will allow the Government to analyze the pricing model’s behavior across multiple scenarios.  The pricing strategy and methodology will be reviewed and considered.  





M.12 	Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) EVALUATION

The Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Factor evaluates the offeror's proposed plan for mitigating any and all real or perceived organizational conflicts of interest as described in Section C.  The evaluation criteria are met when the offeror's OCI Mitigation Plan describes an acceptable approach to identifying, avoiding and mitigating organizational conflicts of interest.  Evaluation of this item is pass/fail. 



Since ensuring trust is of paramount importance, only companies with acceptable Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plans (for themselves and proposed subcontractors) will be eligible for award (emphasis added).                                                                                                                                                    





M.13  Competitive Range Determinations



The Government reserves the right to award this contract based on the initial offers received, without conducting discussions.  If an award cannot be made without conducting discussions, the government will establish a competitive range and commence discussions with only those offerors .  Discussions shall be conducted in accordance with FAR procedures, and may include either written or oral exchanges, or both.  Offerors in the  will be notified of any deficiencies or other issues to address.  The Contracting Officer conducting discussions  will address identified deficiencies and weaknesses but shall not provide any specific suggestions or recommendations for their correction.  If, after discussions have been completed, an Offeror originally in the competitive range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated Offerors being considered for award, that Offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.



M.14  Offeror Debriefings



Pre-award or post-award debriefs of unsuccessful Offerors will be provided if requested in a timely manner.  The successful Offeror may also request a debriefing.  Debriefings of successful and unsuccessful Offerors may be done orally, in writing, by electronic means, or any other method acceptable to the CO.  The Government retains the right to refuse debriefing requests that are not received within three business days of award notification, in accordance with FAR 15.506(a)
