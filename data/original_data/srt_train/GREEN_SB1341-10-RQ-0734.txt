Functional Requirements


Architecture Considerations

The Identity and Access Management System shall be the core infrastructure at NIST and therefore shall comply with the NIST Technical Reference
Model which specifies the preferred Operating Systems, Databases, and technologies supported by NIST’s operational staff. In addition, it is
anticipated that the system shall be required to be included in the NIST Continued Operations (COOP) plans which will require that it be able to
be synchronized across sites.

On the other hand, NIST has limited space and power capacity in its central computing facilities therefore the system shall support operations
in a virtual machine environment for development and test.

NIST currently maintains a heterogeneous information technology infrastructure to support national missions across geographically dispersed
research centers that use non-windows operating systems.

The proposal shall explicitly indicate any particular feature that is not supported via a web interface or in Firefox or Safari, if any.

|                |solution shall maintain its own data source for other aspects of identity and access     |                                  |
|                |management.                                                                              |                                  |


Identity Registration

All NIST accounts are required to be reviewed and approved by resource owners and/or organizational supervisors before they are created.
Accounts are required to be created prior to users’ arrival but only are activated until users are on site due to information security
requirements. Search capability is essential to locate existing identity information to avoid duplicates and facilitate the process.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                     |Meets, Exceeds or Does not Meet   |

|                |notifications.                                                                           |                                  |
|IR-02           |The solution shall provide functions to register accounts associated with existing       |                                  |
|                |accounts, i.e., alias accounts but with separate roles and responsibilities.             |                                  |
|IR-03           |The solution shall allow custom search functions to locate identity information, such as |                                  |
|                |roles, organizations, etc.                                                               |                                  |
|IR-04           |The solution shall allow account to be created in pending mode.                          |                                  |



Identity Administration

ID system administrators need an interface to administrate all identity information, including but not limited to, accounts, roles,
organizations, groups, access policies, etc. Search capability is essential to locate existing identity information to avoid duplicates and
facilitate the process.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                     |Meets, Exceeds or Does not Meet   |
|IA-01           |The solution shall allow searches against one or combinations of attributes to locate    |                                  |
|                |interested identity profiles.                                                            |                                  |
|IA-02           |The solution shall allow to un-provision accounts from systems and applications by       |                                  |
|                |removing the appropriate business roles.                                                 |                                  |
|IA-03           |The solution shall provide functions to define rules that allow automatic role           |                                  |
|                |assignments based on the assignment of another role.                                     |                                  |
|IA-04           |The solution shall provide functions to define rules that allow automatic role           |                                  |
|                |assignments based on the user's attributes.                                              |                                  |
|IA-05           |The solution shall provide functions to define rules that allow automatic role update    |                                  |
|                |based on the changes of users' attributes.                                               |                                  |
|IA-06           |The solution shall provide auditing capability for all administrative activities for     |                                  |
|                |provisioning and role management.                                                        |                                  |
|IA-07           |The solution shall allow for customized password policies and have the capability enforce|                                  |
|                |the policies. (e.g. at least one characters, one number, one special character, minimal  |                                  |
|                |length 12 non-blank characters, may not re-use old password, no dictionary words, no     |                                  |
|                |common sequences, no control characters, and non-printable characters)                   |                                  |
|IA-08           |The solution shall provide password reset or recovery functions for administrators.      |                                  |
|IA-09           |The solution shall allow administrators to manually create a functional account and      |                                  |
|                |assign specify roles.                                                                    |                                  |
|IA-10           |The solution shall allow access to be assigned based on a user's business roles.         |                                  |
|IA-11           |The solution shall allow approving managers to confirm the access described in terms of a|                                  |
|                |user's business roles.                                                                   |                                  |


Access Management

Most of NIST’s applications or services require separation of duties.  User’s roles and accesses should be controlled by configurable rules
within the proposed solution to ensure the requirement of separation of duty but still allow users to request for additional roles that do not
conflict with existing roles.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                     |Meets, Exceeds or Does not Meet   |
|AM-01           |The solution shall provide centralized security policy enforcement of user entitlements  |                                  |
|                |by leveraging role and rule-based access control.                                        |                                  |
|AM-02           |The solution shall provide secured APIs or web services to allow enterprise applications |                                  |
|                |and platforms to integrate into the centralized authentication/authorization framework.  |                                  |
|AM-03           |The solution shall allow the end users to request role assignments.                      |                                  |



Identity Synchronization

NIST has a Central People Table (CPT) that contains all NIST users and serves as NIST’s authoritative data source.  In an addition, NIST uses
Microsoft Active Directory as the authentication and authorization source; therefore, the proposed solution needs to have capability to exchange
user data with the NIST existing infrastructure.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                     |Meets, Exceeds or Does not Meet   |
|IS-01           |The solution shall provide LDAPv3 Directory synchronization.                             |                                  |
|IS-02           |The solution shall provide data transformation and validation rules during               |                                  |
|                |synchronization.                                                                         |                                  |
|IS-03           |The solution shall have an attribute mapping interface that allows the attributes mapping|                                  |
|                |of one system to different attributes on another system.                                 |                                  |
|IS-04           |The solution shall allow bidirectional data flow (including attribute mapping,           |                                  |
|                |transformations, etc.) for example, the ability to configure detection of a telephone    |                                  |
|                |attribute change on Directory A, transformation of telephone attribute, propagation of   |                                  |
|                |telephone attribute to LDAP or other applications.                                       |                                  |
|IS-05           |The solution shall provide Microsoft Active Directory synchronization.                   |                                  |


Automated Provisioning

In order for NIST to modernize identity account management, improve efficiency of account management process and address requests on user
accesses and roles, it is essential that users’ accounts are created automatically across the applications or services in a timely manner and
with minimal human effort.  Department of Commerce (DOC) policy mandates that user accounts must be locked within 24 hours upon separation of
duty or reassignment, including organizational or functional changes.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                     |Meets, Exceeds or Does not Meet   |
|AP-01           |The solution shall be able to create, update, and delete user accounts across the        |                                  |

Audit & Report

Department of Commerce (DOC) policy mandates that user accounts must be locked within 24 hours upon separation of duty or reassignment,
including organizational or functional changes.

Department of Commerce (DOC) policy also mandates that financial records have to be auditable at least for 7 years. Hence, the proposed solution
shall be required to support the mission to enable all identity and access information to be auditable at least for 7 years or longer.

In order to meet DOC’s policy, all accounts’ status and access modifications shall be tracked in the audit log with timestamp of each change and
provide capability to allow administrators to search for specific information.  Department of Commerce (DOC) policy also mandates that financial
records have to be auditable at least for 7 years.

The result of the search needs to be reportable so that it can be reviewed by information security officers and financial auditors.

Miscellaneous

NIST has a heterogeneous information technology infrastructure environment.  It is essential that a common feature that is intended for NIST end
users are a web-based interface, so end users’ ability to access the feature is not depended on the information technology resources used by the
end users.

In order to meet NIST’s information security policy, all web-based technology is required to support SSL v3 or TLS v1.2, and is required to meet
Section 508 Accessibility to support disability users.

NIST is required to lock user account(s) when the user does not meet the information security requirements.  Custom attributes can be used to
track NIST’s specific triggers that affect user account(s) status.

NIST’s contractors can have multiple active agreements with different hosts at the same time.  It is essential that NIST has the capability to
track all locations used by the contractors.

Introduction

In addition to a minimal set of functional requirements to sustain current and future demands for identity and access management services under
OPM mandate on FICAM roadmap implementation guidance, this section will demonstrate a minimal set of business case scenarios required to
modernize existing identity and access management system. Based on studies from existing business processes and requirements gathered and
prioritized from stakeholders, all illustrated cases have been optimized to streamline common services that will comply with the NIST business
process on account management.


Background

This subsection provides some background information and examples that are used in descriptions under business case scenario subsection.


Position to Role Mapping

A new hired person should automatically be placed in the corresponding role(s) based on attributes of their position.

    • Employee in Division 183  => 183_Employee, OCIO_Employee, NIST_Employee

    • Employee in Division 182  => 182_Employee, OCIO_Employee, NIST_Employee

    • Employee in Division 851  => 851_Employee, MEL_Employee, NIST_Employee

    • Manager in Division 183 => 183_Manager, 183_Employee, OCIO_Employee, NIST_Employee

    • Division Chief in 183 => OCIO_Manager, 183_Manager, 183_Employee, OCIO_Employee, NIST_Employee


Requested Role Processing:

Additional Roles should be available for request and approval within the ID Management System. Roles will have varying approvals as outlined
below:

    • Email_Calendar_User  => Immediate Supervisor (Employee’s supervisor or Associate’s host)

    • Help_Desk_User => Immediate Supervisor (Employee’s supervisor or Associate’s host) AND Help_Desk_Owner

    • DBA  => Manager (Employee’s supervisor or Associate’s host, if host is Manager if not host’s supervisor)


Role and Services Mapping

For the purpose of the scenarios, below are a number of NIST roles and services that a user should automatically receive when assigned to the
role:

Table 1:  Role and Services Mapping

*Users with the appropriate role should automatically receive the access to the service


Account Definition

The following types of account are used within NIST.

    • User Account = this is a regular user account that’s always ties back to a person.  If the person leaves NIST or on longer holds the
      position, the user account is deactivated.

    • Root/Administrator Account = this account has full access to the root system or the complete application.  The account is unique to the
      system or the application.  It does not tie back to a person.  Users would not use this account for daily activity.

    • Privileged Account = same requirement as user account; in an addition, this account has higher access level or access to the complete
      application or system just as a root or an administrator account.

    • Functional Account = this is an application or service account.  It is not used by a user.  It has the same access level as a user account.
       It always ties back to a person but it does not get deactivated when a person leaves NIST or the position, instead it gets assigned to the
      person’s supervisor.

                                                                STATEMENT OF WORK


        Background



The US Department of Commerce (DOC) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement to modernize identity account
management and improve efficiency of account management processes by linking users’ logical accesses to assigned business roles. In response to
security events, the ID management team has been frequently asked for roles of users as well as those who have access to particular resources.
Under the current ID management system, it takes a couple of days to respond to the requests.

To comply with HSPD-12 directive and according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) mandate on the Federal Identity, Credentialing and
Access Management (FICAM) roadmap and implementation guidance, starting FY2010, all government agencies are required to implement and integrate
new application systems that accept Personal Identification Verification (PIV) credentials. By the end of FY 2012, Federal Executive agencies
will implement a coordinated approach to FICAM across E-Government interactions [Government-to-Government, Government-to-Business, Government-to-
Citizen, and Internal Effectiveness and Efficiency (IEE)] at all levels of assurance as defined in OMB M-04-04. The aim of this project is to
seek a standards-based solution for NIST-wide identity, credential and access management to ensure alignment, clarity, and interoperability.

All NIST users’ information is stored on a single Oracle system, called the Centralized People Table (CPT).  CPT will serve as NIST’s
authoritative data source for the ID Management software.

CPT creates users from two applications, the NAIS-Web that tracks NIST Associates (contractors and guest researchers) and HRADS for NIST
employees.

While most people hold a single “position” at NIST, people in the CPT have a one-to-many relationship with positions. This will allow the CPT to
support the following NIST situations:

   1. A NIST Associate has relationships (agreements) with multiple NIST organizations.

   2. A person changes from NIST Associate to Employee (Hire) or Employee to Associate (Retirement)

   3. A NIST Employee fills several organizational positions usually additional roles are in an “Acting” capacity.

The full ID Management Systems (IDMS) is intended to be procured in FY2011 contingent upon the availability of funds. This procurement is to
provide NIST with development and test instances of the new IDMS supporting a minimum of 50 and maximum of 200 test users. The allocation of the
total number of 50-200 end user licenses on each instance will be determined by NIST during the configuration of the two environments.





   I. Scope of Work

   The proposed solution shall include

    • Licenses for all IDMS components required to meet NIST’s requirements in Development and Test environment, including maintenance.

    • Professional services for installation and configuration of the development and test IDMS components.  Refer to Attachment A: Business Case
      Scenarios document for the scope of professional services.

    • Knowledge transfers to NIST staff on the installation, configuration and operation of the new IDMS.

The vendor shall provide materials for all knowledge transfer topics.  The Government anticipates the award of a time & materials contract.  The
Government also anticipates that a follow-on contract will follow in FY2011 if the awarded solution successfully performs when tested in the
NIST infrastructure.

  II. Specific Tasks

   The contractor shall perform the following tasks listed below.  Attachment B to the solicitation describes business case scenarios that the
   IDMS will be used for during the testing phase.

contractor shall provide the request revisions within 3 business days of receipt of NIST TIC’s written comments.

  IV. IDMS Minimum Requirements





Architecture Considerations

The Identity and Access Management System shall be the core infrastructure at NIST and therefore shall comply with the NIST Technical Reference
Model which specifies the preferred Operating Systems, Databases, and technologies supported by NIST’s operational staff. In addition, it is
anticipated that the system shall be required to be included in the NIST Continued Operations (COOP) plans which will require that it be able to
be synchronized across sites.

On the other hand, NIST has limited space and power capacity in its central computing facilities therefore the system shall support operations
in a virtual machine environment for development and test.

NIST currently maintains a heterogeneous information technology infrastructure to support national missions across geographically dispersed
research centers that use non-windows operating systems.

The proposal shall explicitly indicate any particular feature that is not supported via a web interface or in Firefox or Safari, if any.

Identity Registration

All NIST accounts are required to be reviewed and approved by resource owners and/or organizational supervisors before they are created.
Accounts are required to be created prior to users’ arrival but only are activated until users are on site due to information security
requirements. Search capability is essential to locate existing identity information to avoid duplicates and facilitate the process.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                                                       |

Identity Administration

ID system administrators need an interface to administrate all identity information, including but not limited to, accounts, roles,
organizations, groups, access policies, etc. Search capability is essential to locate existing identity information to avoid duplicates and
facilitate the process.

|IA-11           |The solution shall allow approving managers to confirm the access described in terms of a user's business roles.           |


Access Management

Most of NIST’s applications or services require separation of duties.  User’s roles and accesses should be controlled by configurable rules
within the proposed solution to ensure the requirement of separation of duty but still allow users to request for additional roles that do not
conflict with existing roles.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                                                       |
|AM-01           |The solution shall provide centralized security policy enforcement of user entitlements by leveraging role and rule-based  |
|                |access control.                                                                                                            |
|AM-02           |The solution shall provide secured APIs or web services to allow enterprise applications and platforms to integrate into   |
|                |the centralized authentication/authorization framework.                                                                    |
|AM-03           |The solution shall allow the end users to request role assignments.                                                        |



Identity Synchronization

NIST has a Central People Table (CPT) that contains all NIST users and serves as NIST’s authoritative data source.  In an addition, NIST uses
Microsoft Active Directory as the authentication and authorization source; therefore, the proposed solution needs to have capability to exchange
user data with the NIST existing infrastructure.

|Reference       |Requirement Criteria                                                                                                       |
|IS-01           |The solution shall provide LDAPv3 Directory synchronization.                                                               |

|                |propagation of telephone attribute to LDAP or other applications.                                                          |
|IS-05           |The solution shall provide Microsoft Active Directory synchronization.                                                     |


Automated Provisioning

In order for NIST to modernize identity account management, improve efficiency of account management process and address requests on user
accesses and roles, it is essential that users’ accounts are created automatically across the applications or services in a timely manner and
with minimal human effort.  Department of Commerce (DOC) policy mandates that user accounts must be locked within 24 hours upon separation of
duty or reassignment, including organizational or functional changes.

Audit & Report

Department of Commerce (DOC) policy mandates that user accounts must be locked within 24 hours upon separation of duty or reassignment,
including organizational or functional changes.

Department of Commerce (DOC) policy also mandates that financial records have to be auditable at least for 7 years. Hence, the proposed solution
shall be required to support the mission to enable all identity and access information to be auditable at least for 7 years or longer.

In order to meet DOC’s policy, all accounts’ status and access modifications shall be tracked in the audit log with timestamp of each change and
provide capability to allow administrators to search for specific information.  Department of Commerce (DOC) policy also mandates that financial
records have to be auditable at least for 7 years.

The result of the search needs to be reportable so that it can be reviewed by information security officers and financial auditors.

Miscellaneous

NIST has a heterogeneous information technology infrastructure environment.  It is essential that a common feature that is intended for NIST end
users are a web-based interface, so end users’ ability to access the feature is not depended on the information technology resources used by the
end users.

In order to meet NIST’s information security policy, all web-based technology is required to support SSL v3 or TLS v1.2, and is required to meet
Section 508 Accessibility to support disability users.

NIST is required to lock user account(s) when the user does not meet the information security requirements.  Custom attributes can be used to
track NIST’s specific triggers that affect user account(s) status.

NIST’s contractors can have multiple active agreements with different hosts at the same time.  It is essential that NIST has the capability to
track all locations used by the contractors.
