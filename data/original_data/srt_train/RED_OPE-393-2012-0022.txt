    Public Service Announcement for Outreach and Enrollment to American Indian and Alaska Natives in Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance
                                                                     Programs


                                                                OPE-393-2012-0022





     I. BACKGROUND


   CMS administers the Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Programs. These programs are very important to the delivery of health care to
   American Indians and Alaskan Native people and the funding from these programs account for a significant portion of the Indian health care
   budget. Section 201 of the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) appropriated $10 million for grants for
   tribal communities to conduct outreach and increase enrollment and participation of eligible children under Titles XIX and XXI. These grants
   were awarded to 41 tribal communities that included Indian Health Service providers, Tribes and urban Indian organizations receiving funds
   under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Another $10 million was designated for national outreach campaign with a specific
   reference to produce materials for outreach to AI/AN. The Recovery Act changes in the Medicaid program must be conveyed in these materials
   since they also impact eligibility and enrollment.






    II. PURPOSE


   The purpose of this contract is to develop and produce 1) 30 second audio and video segment, 2) 60 second video and audio segment and 3) five
   print PSAs to disseminate to radio and  television stations serving tribal communities in rural and urban areas. There is widespread
   recognition that AI/AN are under enrolled in CMS programs and that the health disparities in this population are disproportionately large
   compared to other populations. Based on previous outreach activities and recommendations from CMS’ Tribal Technical Advisory Group, video and
   written products that are culturally appealing to tribal communities are effective tools in explaining Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP programs to
   the AI/AN population including partners in local communities.
