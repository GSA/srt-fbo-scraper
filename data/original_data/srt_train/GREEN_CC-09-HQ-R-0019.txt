OCC ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS Reference: Details and Deliverables
ACCESSIBILITY
This document outlines the accessibility requirements that is required for OCC Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliveries.   29 USC 794(d)
FAR 39.2
36 CFR 1194 All results shall be fully explained by the vendor prior OCC acceptance.  All documents and deliverables are subject to OCC review prior to acceptance.  Details shall include:
1) How the product met each requirement
2) Method used to test and the results
3) N/A for items that do not apply to the deliverable

Details can be explained on this matrix or attached on a separate document, referenced within this matrix.
1.0 Functional Performance Criteria 

(APPLIES TO ALL EIT PRODUCT AND SERVICE DELIVERABLES)
1.01 The EIT deliverables shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user vision, or support for assistive technology used by people who are blind or visually impaired. This includes full keyboard-only access for all functions of the system and controls that are readable with assistive technologies. 36 CFR 1194.31(a)
1.02 The EIT deliverables shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require visual acuity greater than 20/70 that must be in audio and enlarged print output working together or independently, or support for assistive technology used by people who are visually impaired.  This includes users with color blindness disabilities.  It is recommended that support for assistive technology be used to satisfy this requirement. 36 CFR 1194.31(b)
1.03 The EIT deliverables shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user hearing, or support for assistive technology used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing. 36 CFR 1194.31(c)
1.04 The EIT deliverables, where audio information is important for the use of a product, shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval in an enhanced auditory fashion, or support for assistive hearing devices. 36 CFR 1194.31(d)
1.05 The EIT deliverables shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require user speech, or support for assistive technology used by people with disabilities. 36 CFR 1194.31(e)
1.06 The EIT deliverables shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require fine motor control or simultaneous actions and that is operable with limited reach and strength. 36 CFR 1194.31(f)
1.07 If the system utilizes dynamic updates or features within any user interface, including a Web-based interface, the system must provide support for assistive technology such as tracking focus, providing user-controlled keyboard or automatic navigation (focus control) to updated content to ensure the updated information is available to users who are blind or have low vision disabilities compariable to access by users without disabilities.  When this type of dynamic functionality exist within a Web site, such as but not limited to the use of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), Macromedia Flash, or similar approach or technology, the Web interface is required to comply with item 4 "Software Applications" as OCC has identified these emerging technologies as not being accessible by using "Web" standards alone.  The use of "Software" standards in these instances satisfy compliance by supporting the Functional Performance Criteria as required. 36 CFR 1194.5
2.0 Web-based Technical Requirements 

Applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (non-static) interface, embeds custom user control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) then “1194.21 Software” standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.
2.01 A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content).  This includes but not limited to all input fields, images, objects, links included on the Web (browser) interface. 36 CFR 1194.22(a)
2.02 Equivalent alternatives (audio and visual content) for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation.  All Web-based multimedia must also comply with item 4 (Software Applications) and item 5 (Video and Multimedia Technical Requirements) of this matrix. 36 CFR 1194.22(b)
2.03 All Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 36 CFR 1194.22(c)
2.04 Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 36 CFR 1194.22(d)
2.05 No server-side image maps are to be used without OCC Contracting Officer or COTR approval after consultation with OCC Section 508 Program Office. 36 CFR 1194.22(e)
2.06 Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps 36 CFR 1194.22(f)
2.07 Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 36 CFR 1194.22(g)
2.08 Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers.  When using tables for the display of form fields, table headers shall not substitute for the use of explicit labels as identified in 2.14 36 CFR 1194.22(h)
36 CFR 1194.22(n)
2.09 Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 36 CFR 1194.22(i)
2.1 Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.  To measure this for compliance, OCC will focus on the existence of flashing items that are recognizable with the naked eye and if noticable, the blink rate shall be flashing slower than 2 "blinks" per second.  Any noticable flash exceeding this threshold will be considered a violation of this requirement.  No use of marquee or scrolling content is permitted without prior approval from the OCC Contracting Officer or COTR with consultation with OCC Section 508 Program Office. 36 CFR 1194.22(j)
2.11 The system shall use a standard (single) interface that is accessible to both users with and without disabilites with rare exception.  Upon rare exception with OCC Contracting Officer or COTR approval in accordance with instructions below, providing a text-only page with equivalent information or functionality may be permitted to make a web site accessible, when accessibility and conformance of this requirement cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes.  All request for approval will need to clearly identify that it is technically impossible to provide the page in an accessible format based on OCC business needs, not design choice or preferred technical approach, with an operational plan showing that safeguards are in place that will update the text-only page whenever the primary page changes.  NOTE: This system is intended to be a "one system accessible to all end-users" design, regardless of disability. 36 CFR 1194.22(k)
2.12 When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology.  This does not prohibit the use of scripting but does require that when scripting is used, the information is readily accessible to assistive technology, has appropriate functional text, and is fully functional via the keyboard. 36 CFR 1194.22(l)
36 CFR 1194.31
36 CFR 1194.21(a)
2.13 When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in, or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page shall provide a link to the plug-in or applet that complies with item 4 (Software Applications) of this matrix.  For the purposes of applications intended to be limited to internal OCC use (Intranet), OCC will not require a link be present on each page.  OCC internal policies prohibit users from loading applications on their workstations without approval.  If plug-ins are necessary, this does not exempt the vendor from ensuring that the plug-in complies with item 4 (Software Applications of this matrix).  OCC will satisfy the "link availability" through it's internal process for installation of software on OCC workstations. 36 CFR 1194.22(m)
2.14 When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.  OCC requires the use of explicit labels in all instances.  Explicit labels include but not limit the proper use of the HTML <label> tag when applicable.  For non-HTML technical approaches, the measurement of compliance will be evaluated based on item 4 (Sofware Applications). 36 CFR 1194.22(n)
2.15 A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 36 CFR 1194.22(o)
2.16 When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required.  For the purpose of measuring "sufficient time", OCC has determined that 30 seconds for end-of-session or inactivity log-out based on security requirements is acceptable. 36 CFR 1194.22(p)
3.0 Information, Documentation and Support

Information Documentation and Support, applies to all documents, reports, as well as help and support services. To ensure that documents and reports fulfill the required “1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria”, they shall comply with the technical standard associated with Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications at a minimum. In addition, any help or support provided in this work statement that offer telephone support, such as, but not limited to, a help desk shall have the ability to transmit and receive messages using TTY.
3.01 Product training, support and help documentation provided must be made available in electronic format that is accessible to end users identified in item 1 (Functional Performance Criteria). All documents and reports shall comply with the technical standards of item 2 (Web-based technical requirements) regardless of intended delivery method.  For spreadsheets, documents and reports that contain interactive content they shall comply with standards in item 4 (Software Applications) in addtion to item 2 (Web-based technical requirements).   36 CFR 1194.41
36 CFR 1194.31
36 CFR 1194.21
36 CFR 1194.22
3.02 The contractor shall provide a description of the accessibility and compatibility features used to comply with the accessibility requirements within any help or support feature provided as part of the system.  If the system contains a help feature within the application, the feature shall be compliant with the applicable standards within this matrix and have a help section that identifies accessibility and compatability features.  If accessibility was achieved by following the specific technical standards and no "vendor created" short-cut or features were added to make compliant, this can be marked not applicable.  36 CFR 1194.41
3.03 Support services for products shall accommodate the communication needs of end-users with disabilities.  Any help-desk must include Teletypewriter (TTY) support for users with hearing and speech disabilities when the service has telephone support available. 36 CFR 1194.41
4.0 Software Applications (Applies to Software applications, some Web applications and some interactive documents)

Certain "Web" based applications: Applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (non-static) interface, embeds custom user control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) then “1194.21 Software” standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.
4.01 When software is designed to run on a system that has a keyboard, product functions shall be executable from a keyboard where the function itself, or the result of performing a function can be discerned textually. 36 CFR 1194.21(a)
4.02 Applications shall not disrupt or disable activated features of other products that are identified as accessibility features, where those features are developed and documented according to industry standards. Applications also shall not disrupt or disable activated features of any operating system that are identified as accessibility features where the application programming interface for those accessibility features has been documented by the manufacturer of the operating system and is available to the product developer. 36 CFR 1194.21(b)
4.03 A well-defined on-screen indication of the current focus shall be provided that moves among interactive interface elements as the input focus changes. The focus shall be programmatically exposed so that assistive technology can track focus and focus changes. 36 CFR 1194.21(c)
4.04 Sufficient information about a user interface element including the identity, operation and state of the element shall be available to assistive technology. When an image represents a program element, the information conveyed by the image shall also be available in text. 36 CFR 1194.21(d)
4.05 When bitmap images are used to identify controls, status indicators, or other programmatic elements, the meaning assigned to those images shall be consistent throughout an application's performance. 36 CFR 1194.21(e)
4.06 Textual information shall be provided through operating system functions for displaying text. The minimum information that shall be made available is text content, text input caret location, and text attributes. 36 CFR 1194.21(f)
4.07 Applications shall not override user selected contrast and color selections and other individual display attributes. 36 CFR 1194.21(g)
4.08 Animation is not permitted in this system unless approved by the OCC Contracting Officer or COTR. 36 CFR 1194.21(h)
4.09 Color coding shall not be used as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. 36 CFR 1194.21(i)
4.1 When a product permits a user to adjust color and contrast settings, a variety of color selections capable of producing a range of contrast levels shall be provided. 36 CFR 1194.21(j)
4.11 Software shall not use flashing or blinking text, objects, or other elements having a flash or blink frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. To measure this for compliance, OCC will focus on the existence of flashing items that are recognizable with the naked eye and if noticable, the blink rate shall be flashing slower than 2 "blinks" per second.  Any noticable flash exceeding this threshold will be considered a violation of this requirement.  No use of marquee or scrolling content is permitted without prior approval from the OCC Contracting Officer or COTR with consultation with OCC Section 508 Program Office. 36 CFR 1194.21(k)
4.12 When electronic forms are used, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.

                                                                STATEMENT OF WORK

1. PURPOSE. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires a responsible
vendor to provide estimates of one-year probabilities of default for U.S. and foreign public companies that are accessed through a convenient to
use, web-based graphic user interface.  Coverage of U.S. and foreign public companies must be extensive.  We also require the vendor to provide
software or vendor services that will allow bulk data downloads by the OCC of current and historical values for the probabilities of default and
related data (as described below) provided by the vendor.

2.  BACKGROUND.  For the past several years, the OCC acquired monthly estimates of one-year probabilities of default from Moody’s KMV as part of
a multi-agency agreement among the OCC, Federal Reserve, and FDIC.  This contract has expired.  The OCC seeks a new contract for data on one-
year probabilities of default.  While the previous contract required monthly data updates, the OCC now wants to contract for data that are
updated daily.


3.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE.  The Contractor shall perform contract activities based out
of their facilities.  No work shall be performed at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency except that the contractor shall provide
training at the OCC at mutually agreed upon times.

4.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.  The contractor shall provide the data and support services described herein continuously for one calendar year from
the date of the award.  The contractor shall begin providing data within two weeks of the award.  Support services provided by the vendor in the
offices of the OCC shall be provided from-time-to-time at times mutually agreed upon by the vendor and the OCC.  On-line support services (web-
based and telephone) shall be provided continuously for one calendar year from the date of the award.

5.   TASKS.

5.1 Data:  At a minimum the data shall include company name, country, one-year probability of default for that company, and data for the factors
that the vendor uses to calculate the company probability of default (“related data”).  Data shall also include identifiers that the OCC can use
to map the vendor’s data to firms in Standard & Poor's Compustat® (for foreign companies, any comparable company financial database), including
common company identifier code such as ticker or GVKEY and industry code such as NAICS or SIC.  Coverage shall include U.S. and foreign public
companies.

5.2 Web-based interface:  The web-based graphic user interface shall provide daily updates of the probabilities of default for the U.S. and
foreign public companies contained in the data.

The graphic user interface shall display at least five (5) years of data for probabilities of default and related data.

The graphic user interface shall include pre-determined aggregates of firms such as industries or sectors, all financials, all non-financials,
rating agency ratings, and countries, and shall include statistics that describe aspects of distributions of probabilities of default (such as
median).

At a minimum, the web-based interface shall allow the OCC to download current and historical one-year probabilities of default and related data
into Microsoft Excel and other standard database programs owned or licensed by the OCC. (The OCC owns Microsoft Office, including Microsoft
Excel Access.  The OCC also uses SAS.  A complete list of OCC owned software is available upon request.)


5.3 Bulk data downloads:  The vendor shall provide software or vendor services that will allow at least five years of monthly data to be
downloaded by the OCC on an ongoing monthly basis through a bulk data download.  A dataset with a history extending back 10 years must be
available for a one-time bulk download.  The method used for calculating the probabilities of default for the historical data must be the same
as the method used for calculating current probabilities of default.

5.4 Documentation:  The vendor shall provide documentation that addresses both data and functionality.  Documentation shall explain how to
download data, identify every variable that can be downloaded, and describe the frequency of the data (e.g. daily or monthly) and the precision
of the estimate.

The vendor shall include complete information on the methodology (such as underlying model, empirical framework, and reference dataset) used to
calculate the probability of default.  The vendor shall include documentation of model application (such as model inputs, model outputs, ability
to perform what-if scenarios), model performance (back-testing or other validation, including the frequency of validation), processes used in
creating and updating the data, and whether any industries exhibit unique characteristics that affect the applicability of the methodology.

5.5 Technical Support:  The vendor must provide technical support to OCC users of the data, including guiding OCC users through the use of the
data. At a minimum this shall include a technical training session at the OCC on the web-based interface and a seminar on methodology and usage.
 Ongoing technical support (minimum half-day initial response time) for the web-based interface and bulk-data download is required.  Support
services provided by the vendor in the offices of the OCC shall be provided from-time-to-time at times mutually agreed upon by the vendor and
the OCC.  On-line support services (web-based and telephone) shall be provided continuously for one calendar year from the date of the award.

        (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2).
      (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the

all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the
contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor
shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give
the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which
reasonably could have been avoided.
  (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the
Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with
adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any
amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided

of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.,
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act; 41 U.S.C. 51-58, Anti-Kickback Act of 1986; 41 U.S.C. 265 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to
whistleblower protections; 49 U.S.C. 40118, Fly American; and 41 U.S.C. 423 relating to procurement integrity.
  (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
    (1) The schedule of supplies/services.
    (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts paragraphs of
this clause.
    (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
    (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
    (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
    (7) The Standard Form 1449.
    (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
    (9) The specification.
  (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR
database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov
or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

                                                                 (End of clause)

      System (CPS), an internet-based database of contractor performance information.  The OCC will enter the information, gathered from the
      evaluation, into the CPS.  The contractor will have access to and will be able to provide comments on the evaluation through the database.
      The contractor must first register to gain access to the NIH database at https://cpscontractor.nih.gov/cr.asp.  The contractor will have 30
      days to respond to the evaluation.  If a response is not entered within 30 days, the evaluation will stand as written.

   3. If the contractor responds to the evaluation, and the response rebuts any or all of the ratings, the Contracting Officer will attempt to
      reconcile the areas of disagreement with the contractor.  If agreement cannot be reached, the evaluation and response shall be reviewed at
      a level higher than the Contracting Officer and a final evaluation will be issued by the reviewing official.  If the reviewing official
      finds, either all or in part, against the contractor, the contractor’s response shall become part of the final evaluation.  The reviewing
      official’s final decision shall not be subject to dispute under the terms and conditions of the Disputes clause nor subject to resolution
      in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Alternative Dispute Resolution clause.  The reviewing official will provide the
      contractor with a copy of the final evaluation.

   4. Any government agency authorized to access the NIH database will be able to view the performance information related to this contract.  Any
      government agency may also receive a copy the contractor’s performance evaluation, and any associated comments, by contacting the OCC.  The
      OCC will also, upon request, provide copies of any and all of the contractor’s evaluations to the contractor.

                                                                 (End of Clause)

this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum,

items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
    (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and
provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions
of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for
receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the
sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
  (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office
designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after
the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of
entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and
was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be
considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office
designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received
at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile
offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers,
the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions
with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However,
the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may
reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.

Facsimile and email proposals are not authorized for this solicitation

B. SUBMISSION OF COMPLETE PROPOSALS

Offerors are cautioned to strictly comply with all instructions within this solicitation to ensure submission of a complete proposal.  Failure
to furnish a complete proposal, at the time of proposal submission, may result in the proposal being unacceptable to the Government and
elimination from consideration for award.

C. SPECIAL NOTICES TO OFFERORS

      (a)   The exclusive responsibility for source selection will reside with the Government.  Proprietary information submitted in response to
this solicitation will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act as amended
(41 U.S.C 423) (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) as implemented in FAR.

      (b)   Upon receipt, all responses to this RFP become Government property.

D. PROPOSAL FORMAT AND CONTENT AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Deadline for Receipt of Proposals is January 28, 2009 on or before 3:00 local time.  Offerors assume full responsibility for ensuring that their
proposals are received by the due date and time.

Each proposal shall consist of two volumes as indicated below:

Volume I:  Technical Approach & Past Performance

A.  Technical Approach
The offeror's technical approach must demonstrate an understanding of the requirements, delineating the techniques and procedures that will be
used to satisfy the requirements in a quality and timely manner.  The technical approach shall address each functional element in the SOW in
enough detail to clearly and fully demonstrate that the Offeror understands the requirements and the inherent challenges and risks.

Specifically, offerors shall at a minimum provide the following:

 - Describe how the vendor ‘s web-based graphic user interface meets or exceeds the minimum requirements listed in the Statement of Work (SOW).
 - Describe how the vendor’s software for downloading data meets or exceeds the minimum requirements listed in the SOW.
 - Describe the processes used in creating, updating, and validating the probabilities of default, and the frequency with which the one-year
   probably of defaults will be updated for on-line access and bulk data download.
 - Describe the technical support that will be provided to OCC users.  If requested, the vendor
   should be prepared to give an on-site demonstration of its web-based graphic user interface.


B.  Past Experience/Past Performance
The offeror shall provide 3 past performance references with information showing at least three (3) years of experience in the same or similar
requirements.  Same or similar requirements means that work performed must be of equivalent scope and complexity as that described in this
solicitation.  The past performance references must be for work performed by the Offeror in the capacity of a prime contractor.  Provided below
is the minimum information required:
   1. Contracting Officer – telephone and email (Government Contracts)
   2. Description of work
   3. Value of work

The OCC will contact past performance references and request that each reference complete the past performance questionnaire/survey (Attachment
A).  However, the Government reserves the right to use past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the
Offeror, and that information will be used for the evaluation of past performance.

The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the SOW.  The vendor shall
provide documentation that establishes the vendor’s analytical expertise in the area of default probability estimation and its experience in
providing this information to its clients.  Past performance must also show who have used or are currently using the vendor’s web-based graphic
user interface and the vendor’s software for downloading data.  The Offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar
work, including customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing stated goals.  If the Offeror
does not have a record of relevant past performance or does not have any past performance information available, the Offeror will not be
evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral. The Government may evaluate the past performance
of the offeror’s proposed key subcontractors in the same manner as the prime contractor to the extent warranted.  


Volume II – Price/Cost (Price/Cost data shall only be included in this volume)
The following information must be provided in the price proposal:
1) Price/Rate for each CLIN (labor/supplies).  All rates shall be inclusive of wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses and profit.
2) Representations & Certifications
3) Original signed SF form

Price will be evaluated but not point scored. The Government will evaluate the total price proposed to determine price reasonableness as it
relates to the technical requirements, and to assist in the best value determination. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to
determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing
pursuant to FAR 15.404-1 (g) (3).



E. SUBMISSIONS OF PROPOSALS

Offerors shall submit two (4) paper copy original proposals.  In addition, Offerors shall submit electronic (PDF format only on Compact Disks
(CD)) copies of the proposal to the address below no later than the date and time specified.

           NOTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST


           As per FAR Subpart 9.505, the two underlying principles regarding a conflict of interest are:

(a) Preventing the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment; and
(b) Preventing unfair competitive advantage. In addition to the other situations described in this subpart, an unfair competitive advantage
exists where a contractor competing for award of any Federal contract possesses --
(1) Proprietary information that was obtained from a Government official without proper authorization; or
(2) Source selection information (as defined in FAR 2.101) that is relevant to the contract but is not available to all competitors, and such
information would assist that contractor in obtaining the contract.

The offeror shall respond to this notification by addressing in its proposal how it intends to avoid, neutralize or mitigate any possible
conflict of interest. Offerors shall identify any conflict or potential conflict then explain how it will be mitigated. If a conflict of
interest is determined to exist that cannot be avoided or mitigated the contracting officer may withhold award.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—
    (1) ο Are, ο are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
    (2) ο Have, ο have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or

these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) ο Have, ο have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
  (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to

subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or

                                                           EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


A.  52.212-2 EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

The evaluation factors are listed below in descending order of importance
      Factor 1:  Technical approach and Capability to perform tasks
      Factor 2: Past Performance
      Factor 3:  Price/Cost

Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined are significantly more important than factor 4.

  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.
                                                                (End of Provision)

B. ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 –EVALUATION –COMMERCIAL ITEMS

As stated in 52.212-2, entitled Evaluation – Commercial Item, the factors that shall be used to evaluate the offers are technical approach, key
personnel, past performance, and price with award being made to the offeror that provides the best overall value to the Government.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions; therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Offeror’s
best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the
Contracting Officer to be necessary.  If the Government decides that discussions are necessary, the CO will establish a competitive range of the
most highly rated proposals.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals in the competitive range exceeds the number at
which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the
greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.


C. Evaluation of Proposals

The Government will evaluate the following factors:


The following evaluation factors will be utilized in the evaluation of the proposals.


Factor 1 – Technical Approach – Statement of Work
 - Describe how the vendor ‘s web-based graphic user interface meets or exceeds the minimum requirements listed in the Statement of Work (SOW).
 - Describe how the vendor’s software for downloading data meets or exceeds the minimum requirements listed in the SOW.
 - Describe the processes used in creating, updating, and validating the probabilities of default, and the frequency with which the one-year
   probably of defaults will be updated for on-line access and bulk data download.
 - Describe the technical support that will be provided to OCC users.  If requested, the vendor
   should be prepared to give an on-site demonstration of its web-based graphic user interface.

Factor 2 – Past Performance


The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the SOW.  The vendor shall
provide documentation that establishes the vendor’s analytical expertise in the area of default probability estimation and its experience in
providing this information to its clients.  Past performance must also show who have used or are currently using the vendor’s web-based graphic
user interface and the vendor’s software for downloading data.  The Offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar
work, including customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing stated goals.  If the Offeror
does not have a record of relevant past performance or does not have any past performance information available, the Offeror will not be
evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral. The Government may evaluate the past performance
of the offeror’s proposed key subcontractors in the same manner as the prime contractor to the extent warranted.  

Factor 3 - Price

Price will be evaluated but not point scored. The Government will evaluate the total price proposed to determine price reasonableness as it
relates to the technical requirements, and to assist in the best value determination. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to
determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing
pursuant to FAR 15.404-1 (g) (3).
