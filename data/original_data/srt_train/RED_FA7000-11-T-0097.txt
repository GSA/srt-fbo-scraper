CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

 (i) price; (ii) past performance

Past performance is equally important as compared to price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

(End of provision)



 52.212-5     CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2011)  (DEVIATION)

(a) Comptroller General Examination of Record.  The Contractor shall comply with the provisions of this paragraph (a) if this contract was

and Records-Negotiation.

(1) The Comptroller General of the United States, or an authorized representative of the Comptroller General, shall have access to and right to
examine any of the Contractor's directly pertinent records involving transactions related to this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall make available at its offices at all reasonable times, the records, materials, and other evidence for examination,
audit, or reproduction, until 3 years after final payment under this contract or for any shorter period specified in FAR Subpart 4.7, Contractor
Records Retention, of the other clauses of this contract. If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records relating to the
work terminated shall be made available for 3 years after any resulting final termination settlement. Records relating to appeals under the
disputes clause or to litigation or the settlement of claims arising under or relating to this contract shall be made available until such
appeals, litigation, or claims are finally resolved.

(3) As used in this clause, records include books, documents, accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and
regardless of form. This does not require the Contractor to create or maintain any record that the Contractor does not maintain in the ordinary
course of business or pursuant to a provision of law.

(b)(1) Notwithstanding the requirements of any other clause in this contract, the Contractor is not required to flow down any FAR clause, other

ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).

a.  BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:  The Government intends to award contract to offeror which represents best overall value in accordance with FAR
Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history and price will be considered.  By submission of its offer, the offeror
accedes to ALL solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements.    The
government reserves the right to reject any offer that does not meet all requirements of the solicitation.  Offerors must clearly identify any
exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.

b.  The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106.  In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting
offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --
(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and
(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:
(A) The contracting officer’s knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;
(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;
(C) The Government wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or
(D) Any other reasonable basis.

c.   The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:
Step 1.   Rank all proposals by price.   IAW FAR 13.106-2 The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish
best overall value to the government.
Step 2 – Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors that do not conform fully to the solicitation
will not be considered.
Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performance information  as stated above.

 d.   PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance rating of “Sufficient Past Performance”
or “Limited Past Performance”. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating “Unknown Past
Performance”, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  Confidence ratings are defined as follows:

      SUFFICIENT PAST PERFORMANCE:  Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will
successfully perform the required effort.

      LIMITED PAST PERFORMANCE:  Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will
successfully perform the required effort.

      UNKNOWN PAST PERFORMANCE:  Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to
successfully perform the required effort.

 e.  When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the
amount of experience, and the flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs.

Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or
critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror.  Offerors with
no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror’s performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be
reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance,” meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the
prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an
"Unknown Past Performance.”

 g.  In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed
most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.

h.  If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a “Sufficient Past Performance” performance rating that offer represents the best
value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of
any other offers.

The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a
performance confidence assessment of "Limited Past Performance" or when it is in the best interest of the government to do so.

i.  If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a “Sufficient Past Performance” rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated
and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a “Sufficient Past Performance”  performance rating or
until all offerors are evaluated.

j.  Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions.  Offerors may
be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously
had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory
rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to
resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the
opportunity for proposal revision.

k.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The government, however, reserves the right to
conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government.
