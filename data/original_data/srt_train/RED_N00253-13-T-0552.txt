NOTE 7: You must supply Manufacturers information as requested in provision C.108. Supply city/state if in the United States and/or the country of origin if outside the United States. NOTE 8: Due to the size of this RFQ the government prefers that submission be electronically by email or fax. NOTE 9: Failure to provide all required information from this solicitation and any subsequent amendment(s) may deem your company to be considered non-responsive. NOTE 10: COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS In order to ensure compliance with all the specification requirements, the contractor shall indicate in its offer, and notify the Government in a cover letter, what specifications, if any; the offeror does not intend to meet. The offeror shall explain, in detail, how any proposed deviation/exception will nonetheless meet the Government's functional requirements. Should descriptive literature be supplied by the offeror, it will be presumed that the offeror intends to meet all of the specifications, regardless of the descriptive literature, unless the offeror specifically notes its exceptions. It shall be the obligation of the contractor to exercise due diligence to discover and to bring to the attention of the contracting officer at the earliest possible time, in writing, any ambiguities, discrepancies, inconsistencies, or conflicts in or between the specifications and the applicable drawings or other documents incorporated by reference herein. Failure to comply with such obligation shall be deemed a waiver and release of any and all claims for extra costs or delays arising out of such ambiguities, discrepancies, inconsistencies and conflicts.

MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS Specifications for CSIPL Software (C-language Signal and Image Processing Library) 1. The required software package must have consist of libraries of assembly optimized digital signal processing (DSP) functions or modules for use with Intel i7 series processors, including the i7-2715QE and i7-3617UE.

N00253-13-T-0552 Page 4 of 44 These functions/modules must be callable from C-language programs. The functions/modules must be written to take maximum advantage of the Intel i7's 256-bit advanced vector accelerator (AVX). 2. Speed of Execution Requirement: The vendor must be able to demonstrate execution of a 1024 point Complex floating point FFT, in-place, in 1.82 microseconds, or less, using an Intel i7 processor with AVX, operating at 2 GHz.. These libraries will be used to replace similar libraries, supplied with most VME based DSP boards, that are specific to the same board vendor. More specifically these libraries must compile to run under VxWorks O.S. version 6.9 and under Linux O.S. (Debian version 7.0). (Note: We're talking about two libraries here, two CSIPLs, one for each O.S., Operating System, to be supported.) The following functions/modules must be provided as part of each library: (a) Vector move, integer: Moves contents of one integer vector to another integer vector. Striding parameters are required on the input and output, as well as the number of values to move. (b) Convert short integer to float: Converts 16-bit integer vector to 32-bit floating point vector. Number of values is a required parameter. (c) Convert integer to float: Converts 32-bit integer vector to 32-bit floating point vector. Number of values is a required parameter. (d) Vector move, float: Moves contents of one floating point vector to another floating point vector. Striding parameters are required on the input and output, as well as the number of values to move. (e) Vector add, float: Computes the sum, by element, of one floating point vector and another floating point vector. Striding parameters are required on both inputs and the output, as well as the number of values to add. (f) Vector multiply, float: Computes the product, by element, of a floating point vector and another floating point vector. Striding parameters are required on both inputs and the output, as well as the number of values to multiply. (g) Vector Maximum value with index, float: Finds the maximum value in a floating point vector and its associated index. Stride and number of values are required parameters. (h) Vector fill, float: Sets the elements of a floating point vector to a scalar value. Stride and number of values are required parameters. (i) Vector mean value, float: Returns the mean value of a floating point vector. Stride and number of values are required parameters. (j) Square root, float: Computes the square root of a scalar. (k) Sine, float: Computes sine of a scalar angle in radians. (l) Cosine, float: Computes cosine of a scalar angle in radians. (m) Complex vector move: Moves contents of one complex floating point vector to another complex floating point vector. Striding parameters are required on the input and output, as well as the number of values to move. (n) Complex vector add: Computes the sum, by element, of one complex floating point vector and another complex floating point vector. Striding parameters are required on both inputs and the output, as well as the number of values to add. (o) Complex vector multiply: Computes the product, by element, of a complex floating point vector and another complex floating point vector. Striding parameters are required on both inputs and the output, as well as the number of values to multiply. (p) Complex vector fill: Sets the elements of a complex floating point vector to scalar values. Stride and number of values are required parameters.

HQ M-2-0016 USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ­ STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NAVSEA)(SEP 2009) (a) Each offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable. The Department of Defense (DOD) has authorized use of PPIRS-SR for use by DOD activities during the acquisition of supplies and services. For purposes of this solicitation, contractor past performance will be based on data from PPIRS-SR. The offeror's quality and delivery classifications from PPIRS-SR will be used in conjunction with the offeror's references, the criteria in FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable, and other provisions of this solicitation. (b) The purpose of PPIRS-SR is to provide source selection officials with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality. This information is collected form existing DOD reporting systems during the source selection process. (c) Quality: PPIRS-SR collects quantifiable quality data from existing systems and uses that data to classify supplier performance by Federal Supply code or federal Services Code (FSA group). Based on comparisons among suppliers in a specific FSC group, PPIRS-SR sorts suppliers into color ratings representing the supplier's overall quality performance based on the following indices: Color Dark Blue Purple Green Yellow Red Position Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group

(Note: if all supplier ratings for a specific FSC group are equal, all suppliers with that group will be classified green. Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be displayed without a rating and, for evaluation, receive a neutral rating.) (d) Delivery: supplier deliver past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the suppliers percentage of on-time deliveries. On-time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor reflecting the length of time a delivery was overdue. (e) PPIRS-SR classifications are determined monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.
