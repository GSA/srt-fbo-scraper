1.1

GENERAL
Scope

1.1.1 The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to automate the production of Merchant Mariner Credentials (MMC) through the purchase and implementation of passport-style credential printer(s). The MMC production facility is located at the National Maritime Center (NMC) in Martinsburg, WV. There are currently no plans to create additional production facilities; however, there may be a Continuity of Operations (COOP) facility located elsewhere. The purpose of this contract is to procure passport-style credential printer(s) and an extended warranty that includes on-site maintenance and repair. 1.2 Background

1.2.1 A strategic initiative of the NMC is to automate the personalization of MMCs. Using passport-style credential printer(s) to automate the creation and personalization of MMCs will increase consistency, increase quality, and reduce the long term cost of the production process. 1.2.2 A MMC is a passport-style booklet with several preprinted pages. The remaining pages are personalized by separately printing a reverse printed laminate on carrier sheets that can hold up to three (3) pages per sheet. Each page is separated by perforations, which must be manually separated and properly placed in the MMC. In order to adhere the individual pages to the booklet, the production technician inserts the MMC into the laminator, which heats the booklet to the correct temperature under a specified pressure. Afterward, the booklet is allowed to cool and the carrier of the laminate removed. 1.2.3 The process for creating each MMC is subject to variations introduced by: human interaction at many stages, multiple interacting supplies, and multiple pieces of equipment. In addition, the process is subject to waste and increased cost as a result of the fixed number of laminate pages per carrier sheet which do not always equate to actual pages within the booklet. 1.3 Contractor Personnel

1.3.1 The Contractor shall provide the necessary staffing, with the appropriate skills and knowledge level, to perform all requirements within this SOW. 1.3.2 The Contractor shall provide a Point of Contact who shall be responsible for all Contractor work performed under this contract. The Point of Contact is further designated as Key by the Government (see Section 1.4, Key Personnel). 1.3.2.1 The Point of Contact shall be a single point of contact for the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). It is anticipated that the Point of Contact shall be one of the senior level employees provided by the Contractor for this work effort. The name of Point of Contact, and the name(s) of any alternate(s) who shall act for the Contractor in the absence of the Point of Contact, shall be provided to the USCG. During any absence of the Point of Contact, only one alternate shall have full authority to act for the Contractor on all matters relating to work performed under this contract. The Point of Contact and all designated alternates shall be able to read, write, speak, and understand English. 1.3.2.2 The Point of Contact shall be available to the COR via telephone between the hours of 0800 and 1700 local time, Monday through Friday, and shall respond to a request for discussion or resolution of technical problems within four (4) hours of notification. 1.3.3 Employee Conduct

1.3.3.1 Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies, and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, DHS, or the USCG. 1.3.3.2 The Point of Contact shall ensure Contractor employees understand and abide by USCG established rules, regulations, and policies concerning safety and security.

1.3.3.3 The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from USCG facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under this contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee. 1.3.4 Conflict of Interest

1.3.4.1 The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest. 1.4 Key Personnel

1.4.1 Before replacing any individual designated as Key by the Government, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer no less than 15 business days in advance, submit written justification for replacement, and provide the name and qualifications of any proposed substitute(s). All proposed substitutes shall possess qualifications equal to or superior to those of the Key person being replaced. The Contractor shall not replace Key Contractor personnel without acknowledgement from the Contracting Officer. The Government may designate additional Contractor personnel as Key in this contract. 1.5 1.5.1 Security Contractor access to classified information is not currently required under this contract.

Page 4

1.17.4.1 36 CFR 1194.2(b) (COTS/GOTS products): When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the standards. If products are commercially available that meet some, but not all of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best meets the standards. When applying this standard, all procurements of EIT shall have documentation of market research that identify a list of products or services that first meet the agency business needs, and from that list of products or services, an analysis that the selected product met more of the accessibility requirements than the non-selected products as required by FAR 39.2. Any selection of a product or service that meets less accessibility standards due to a significant difficulty or expense shall only be permitted under an undue burden claim and requires authorization from the DHS Office of Accessible Systems and Technology (OAST) in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2. 1.17.4.2 All tasks for testing of functional and/or technical requirements must include specific testing for Section 508 compliance, and must use DHS Office of Accessible Systems and Technology approved testing methods and tools. For information about approved testing methods and tools send an electronic mail to accessibility@dhs.gov. 1.18 Enterprise Architecture

1.18.1 Information Assurance (IA) professionals in significant information security roles are required by COMDTINST 5200.3 to have a professional certification. USCG shall provide personnel with the appropriate clearance levels to support the security certification/accreditation processes under this Agreement in accordance with DHS MD 4300A, DHS Sensitive Systems Policy and Handbook. During all SDLC phases of USCG systems, USCG personnel shall develop documentation and provide any required information for all levels of classification in support of the certification/accreditation process. In addition, all security certification/accreditation shall be performed using the DHS certification/accreditation process, methodology, and tools. 1.18.2 DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300 A, Section 4.1.4, requires the "Separation of duties to prevent a single individual from being able to disrupt or corrupt a critical security process." The Policy requires the following: "Components shall divide and separate duties and responsibilities of critical IT system functions among different individuals to minimize the possibility that any one individual would have the necessary authority or system access to be able to engage in fraudulent or criminal activity." Security testing is only one of the critical systems functions that need to be performed by a provider (either Government or Contractor) other than the system designer/developer/operator. 1.18.2.1 This requirement is based, in part, on NIST 800-53 Rev 3, Security Control CA-2 Security Assessments ­ enhancement 1, which requires: "The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to conduct an assessment of the security controls in the information system." Consequently, the vendor that provides SAP services may not perform the security controls testing. 1.18.3 Access to Unclassified Facilities, Information Technology Resources, and Sensitive Information: The assurance of the security of unclassified facilities, Information Technology (IT) resources, and sensitive information during the acquisition process and contract performance are essential to the DHS mission. DHS Management Directive (MD) 11042.1 Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (For Official Use Only) Information, describes how Contractors must handle sensitive but unclassified information. DHS MD 140.01 Information Technology Systems Security and the DHS Sensitive Systems Handbook prescribe policies and procedures on security for IT resources. Contractors shall comply with these policies and procedures, any replacement publications, or any other current or future DHS policies and procedures covering Contractors specifically for all Contracts that require access to DHS facilities, IT resources, or sensitive information. Contractors shall not use or redistribute any DHS information processed, stored, or transmitted by the Contractor except as specified in the contract. 1.19 Interconnection Security Agreements

1.19.1 Interconnections between DHS and non-DHS IT systems shall be established only through controlled interfaces and via approved service providers. The controlled interfaces shall be accredited at the highest security level of information on the network. Connections with other Federal agencies shall be documented based on interagency agreements; memoranda of understanding, service level agreements, or interconnect service agreements.

Page 5

COMDTINST 5000.13 requires an ISA for all interconnections. 1.19.2 FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 197 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 encryption compliance: all hardware and software interfaces shall meet: 1.19.2.1 FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 197 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 encryption compliance. FIPS 197 (Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)) 256 algorithm and cryptographic modules must that have been validated under FIPS 140-2. 1.19.2.2 National Security Agency (NSA) Type 2 or Type 1 encryption.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in
Page 9 of 28

writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-913) U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters Procurement Planning and Oversight Division 1900 Half Street, SW Washington, DC 20593-7112 Telephone: (202) 372-3692 FAX: (202) 475-3904 (END OF PROVISION) FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation ­ Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government intends to award a contract to automate the production of Merchant Mariner Credentials (MMC) through the purchase and implementation of a passportstyle printer, as specified in the SOW, to the Contractor whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, represents the best value to the Government, price and other criteria considered. The determination of Best Value will be based on the following evaluation factors: Technical Past Performance Price Technical is more important than Past Performance. When combined, Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than Price. (b) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without negotiations. Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

Page 10 of 28

ATTACHMENT 4 HSCG23-13-R-MMZ215

Evaluation Factors: The Government will evaluate the proposals against the following three (3) factors: a. Technical: The Government will evaluate the proposal against the requirements of the SOW sections 5.2 ­ 5.9, 5.13, and 5.15. Failure of the offeror to comply with sequentially addressing these SOW requirements, simply restating SOW requirements, or noncompliance with any of the RFP instructions may result in the proposal being rejected and eliminated from further consideration. b. Past Performance: The Government's intent is to determine whether the offeror consistently delivers quality products and services in a timely manner. The Government will consider questionnaires submitted by past performance references. The Government reserves the right to utilize data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). An offeror's lack of relevant past performance information will be evaluated by the Government as "Neutral" for this evaluation factor. c. Price: The Government will not rate or score price, but will analyze each offeror's proposed price for reasonableness. This analysis will substantiate the validity of the offeror's approach to performing the SOW requirements. (a) Reasonableness. In evaluating reasonableness, the Government will determine if the offeror's proposed prices, in nature and amount, do not exceed those which would be incurred by a prudent Contractor in the conduct of competitive business. The assessment of reasonableness will take into account the context of the SOW requirements, including current market conditions and other factors that may impact price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options does not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability
Page 20 of 28

ATTACHMENT 4 HSCG23-13-R-MMZ215

because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
