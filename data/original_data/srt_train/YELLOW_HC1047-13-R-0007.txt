2. Contract Title. Emerging Technologies Program Management Office (ETPMO) Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Unclassified Generic Discovery Server ­ Unclassified (MGDS-U) Development Support 3. Background. The Emerging Technologies PMO was initially established to develop new emerging technologies as directed by PEO COMMS. The PMO was directed to develop and procure capabilities, funded by DISA, to solve Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) end-to-end seam issues and capability gaps identified by the Narrowband satellite communications (SATCOM) System Engineering Group (NSSEG). The MUOS to Legacy Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Gateway Component (MLGC) was started in Fiscal Year 2009 (FY09) followed by the MUOS Voice Gateway (MVG) and MUOS Unclassified Generic Discover Server (MGDS-U) in FY11. 4. Objectives: The objective of this PWS is to outline the MGDS-U development efforts, which is one of the products the ETPMO has been chartered with developing. This effort includes development of the MGDS-U software and hardware solution that will be seamlessly integrated into the DoD Teleport Program Office (TPO) ACAT 1AC MUOS to DISN (M2D) Subsystem as technology insertion to be fielded during the program's Generation Three timeframe. The MGDS-U development effort can be broken down into two functional areas - software development and hardware solution. The MUOS end to end system communicates between deployed user terminals and the strategic DISN network via Satellite Communications (SATCOM). The cipher text (CT) IP addresses are transient and are therefore not guaranteed to remain assigned to a given deployed multi-function terminal (MFT) indefinitely. MUOS dynamically assigns a CT IP address to the terminal when the terminal registers with the Ground Transport System (GTS). The TPO M2D subsystem has plain text (PT) IP address associated with access to the DISN Sensitive, but unclassified Internet Protocol Routed Network (NIPRNET). The deployed MUOS Functional Terminal (MFT) will have fixed PT addresses assigned for gaining access to the DISN NIPRNET. The communication path between

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 14 of 82 M2D and the deployed MFT will be associated at the CT interface and once the security association is established be decrypted to allow access on the PT interfaces. In order to automate CT and PT IP address associations the proposal is to establish the MGDS-U to manage the mapping between the M2D CT IP address and the CT IP address of a given deployed MFT dynamically. Without the MGDS-U the deployed users would need to enter the CT IP address of the distant end cryptographic device manually at the MFT putting the undue burden on the deployed warfighter. The MUOS Classified GDS only supports dynamic CT IP address mapping of security associations for deployed MFT and M2D operating at the Secret level of classification. The Warfighter requires the same level of dynamic security association setup that is provided by the MUOS Classified GDS on the unclassified network. 5. Scope. The scope of this effort is to develop the MGDS-U capability. Qualified contractors will be required to support the following task area:



Task Area 1 ­ MGDS-U Development

6. Performance Requirements 6.1 This is a performance-based work statement (PBWS) and as such, it conveys its performance-based requirements in the following manner. Each performance requirement may contain the three elements below. In each case, the elements taken together constitute the components of a performance requirement.  Performance Requirement -- A statement of the outcome or results expected of the contractor. performance requirement specifies what is to be done. It does not specify how it is to be done. A

 

Performance Standard (PS) -- The targeted level of acceptance performance for determining whether specific performance requirements have been accomplished. Performance Measure (PM) -- Expresses the method that will be used by the government to assess how well the contractor performs specified requirements measured against the performance standards.

6.1.1 Use of Performance Standards and Performance Measures. The contractor shall be contractually obligated to perform every requirement in this performance work statement. Not every performance requirement has a related performance standard or assessment measure expressed in this document. In such cases the performance standard or performance measure is either inherent in the performance requirement or in accordance with standard commercial practice (that is, performance fully complies with customary trade practice). When a performance standard or measure is specified, it may be used to achieve a variety of objectives in order to meet the program's requirement. Such objectives include, but are not limited to, collection of data to test the practicality of a performance standard, the identification of performance when the standard requires less than 100 percent compliance, emphasis on the most critical performance requirements, the collection of data to support quality assurance, assessment of remedies, and documenting performance for inclusion in a past performance information database. 6.2 Task Management. 6.2.1 Subtask 1 ­ The contractor shall prepare a Task Management Plan for the MGDS-U describing the technical approach, organizational resources and management controls to be employed to meet the cost, performance, and schedule requirements throughout contract execution.

3. Primary Method of Surveillance: There shall be 100% Inspection for all requirements. There will also be customer input for all items. The primary method of surveillance for this program shall be periodic inspections and customer input. This shall be accomplished with direct communication and input from government PM and the contractor. There shall be weekly and monthly meetings to the PM to review and evaluate acceptable / satisfactory performance or as directed. For all services rendered under this contract, the contractor must assure accuracy and legibility by implementing quality review process and procedures, quality measurements, checklists, and audits ensuring the highest quality and compliance with deliverables. Periodic inspections automatically become 100 percent evaluations or "100 percent checks." At each milestone, the product must be reviewed for accuracy of technical information, format, and completeness of content, grammar, legibility, and overall effectiveness. In addition, regular frequent communications amongst the PM, Technical Lead, COR, and Contracting Officer shall contribute to the smooth performance of the work efforts. Deliverables will be prepared in accordance with the specific requirements of the PWS. Periodic Inspection: These services are monitored weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually, etc. Periodic types of activities are perfect for periodic inspection because not only are they infrequent, but there is normally a predetermined, specified time frame within which the tasks must be accomplished. Therefore, you know exactly when to conduct the evaluations. Periodic inspections automatically become 100 percent evaluations or "100 percent checks." Inspections should be divided and scheduled by frequency: annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly, weekly and as required. Sometimes services are required for which the time or frequency cannot be predicted, such as accident investigations, one-time special tasking by higher headquarters, etc. These would be labeled "as required inspections." Others are

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 39 of 82

known and predictable such as the quarterly status report or the monthly travel report currently included in some DISA service contracts. Customer Input. Although usually not a primary method, this is a valuable supplement to more systematic methods. For example, in a case where random sampling indicates unsatisfactory service, customer complaints can be used as substantiating evidence. In certain situations where customers can be relied upon to complain consistently when the quality of performance is poor, e.g., dining facilities, building services, customer surveys and customer complaints may be a primary surveillance method, and customer satisfaction an appropriate performance standard. In all cases, complaints must be documented, preferably on a standard form. 4. Scope of Performance: The scope of this contract covers the following: The contractor shall provide a full range of program management, acquisition, and engineering support for the program office in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities as a program manager.

(b) Insert proposed unit and extended prices in the Pricing Schedule. The extended amount must equal the whole dollar unit price multiplied by the number of units. The proposal(s) must be submitted for a base year of (12 months) plus a six (6) month Option. Also, in accordance with FAR clause 52.217-8, the Government has included a six (6) month "option to extend services" optional period, which may be unilaterally exercised by the Government and shall not exceed the above mentioned in duration. (c) Complete the necessary fill-ins and certifications in provisions. The provisions FAR 52.212-3 shall be returned along with the proposal. If you have your Representation and Certifications updated via ORCA, please response stating this and verification can be obtained there. L.3.2 Cost/Price Reasonableness and Realism This section is to assist you in submitting information other than certified cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness and realism of your proposed cost/price. Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal. Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal. Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror's proposal. Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and realism. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed costs/prices rests with the offeror. L.3.3 Estimating Techniques and Methods When responding to the Cost/Price Volume requirements in the solicitation, the offeror and associated subcontractors may use any generally accepted estimating technique, including contemporary estimating methods (such as Cost-to-Cost and Cost-to-Non-Cost Estimating Relationships, commercially available parametric cost models, in-house developed parametric cost models, etc.), to develop their estimates. L.3.4 Cost/Price Information Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your cost/price position. All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price volume. Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal. L.3.5 Cost or Pricing Information Requirements Cost Proposal Submission: Ensure the cost proposal includes detailed cost/price amounts of all resources required to accomplish the task, (i.e. labor categories, labor hours, number of

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 71 of 82

employees for each labor category, rates, travel, incidental equipment, etc.). Labor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g. Direct Labor Rates, Overhead, Fringe Benefits, G&A, and Fee, etc.). All travel must show the specific detail, if known (i.e. Number of days, locations, number of personnel, etc.). All ODC's shall annotate the specific detail (qty, part number, manufacturer, etc.) to include supporting documentation to justify the cost (i.e. vendor quotes, price history, etc.) If a subcontractor relationship exists, the subcontractor must break out their costs, in accordance with the above requirements. If needed, the subcontractor may submit their cost breakout directly to the Contracting Officer. If applicable, travel, shall be authorized by the Task Monitor (TM), in writing, prior to performance and will be paid IAW FAR 31.205-46. ODCs will be paid IAW FAR 31.205. The contractor will be authorized to invoice monthly for all approved travel and ODC costs incurred and approved by the COR. Cost/Price Proposal Templates: See Attachment 3 of the RFP. This is the format that must be used when preparing and submitting your data other than certified cost or pricing data. All templates submitted shall include formulas, and NOT be hard-numbered. Sanitized Cost Proposal. This shall take the same format as described in the Cost Proposal Submission (above) and include the Cost/Price Proposal Templates; however, the Sanitized Cost Proposal shall be scrubbed (sanitized) of all numerical cost and price entries. Note: Mandatory items to be included with your Cost Proposal. A negative reply is required for any element not submitted with your proposal.  Forward Pricing Rate Agreement from, Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation or Forward Pricing Rate Proposal to, the offeror's cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency office.

L.3.6 Volume Organization The Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections: SECTION 1 - Table of Contents; summary descriptions of estimating; changes to estimating. SECTION 2 - Cost or pricing information and supporting data, to include estimating methodology. SECTION 3 - Other information such as Government Furnished Property/Government Furnished Equipment (GFP/GFE), long lead costs, termination costs, inflation rate summary and

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 72 of 82

explanation, and life cycle cost. List each exception to the ground rules and assumptions provided in the solicitation and each qualification of the Cost/Price volume, if any. Provide complete rationale for any exceptions. L.4.0 Technical/Management L.4.1 Technical/Management Volume The Technical/Management Volume should be specific and complete. Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important. Your responses will be evaluated against the technical/management subfactors defined in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award. Using the instructions provided below, provide as specifically as possible the actual methodology you would use for accomplishing/satisfying these subfactors. All the requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory. By your proposal submission, you are representing that your firm will perform all the requirements specified in the solicitation. It is not necessary or desirable for you to tell us so in your proposal. L.4.1.1 Technical/Management In the Technical/Management volume, address your proposed approach to accomplishing each of the tasks as called out in paragraphs 6.2 through 6.3 and all subparagraphs there under of the PWS and for meeting or exceeding the minimum performance or capability requirements of each technical/management subfactor, as well as the risks in your proposed approach in terms of technical/performance, cost, and/or schedule, and the specific mitigating factors you will employ. Failure to address any of the above may be considered a weakness or deficiency and may result in offeror's proposal being determined ineligible for award. L.4.1.2 Technical/Management Risk Address technical/management risk by identifying those aspects of the proposal you consider to have the potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and/or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Provide the rationale for each risk and its rating, including quantitative estimates of the impact on cost, schedule, and performance. Describe the impact of each identified risk in terms of its potential to interfere with or prevent the successful accomplishment of other contract requirements (e.g., PWS or specification requirements), whether or not those requirements are identified as subfactors. Propose a realistic "work-around" or risk mitigators for identified risks that will eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level. Identify and classify any new risks introduced by such risk mitigation. L.4.1.3. TECHNICAL/MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL - Limited to no more than 40 pages excluding cover and page.

L.5.0 Past Performance L.5.1 General Each offeror shall submit a past performance volume with its proposal, containing past performance information in accordance with the format contained in this RFP. This information is required of the offeror and all subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners who are proposed to perform 20 percent or more of the proposed effort based on the total proposed price/cost or perform aspects of the effort the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and may use data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past performance. Along with the information required in this paragraph, the offeror shall submit a consent letter executed by each subcontractor, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner, authorizing release

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 74 of 82

of adverse past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to such information. For each identified effort for a commercial customer, the offeror shall also submit a client authorization letter, authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror's performance. L.5.2 Relevant Contracts Submit information in accordance with Section M. Past Performance Information on three (3) recent contracts that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. A contract is considered recent if performed within the last three (3) years of issuance of this solicitation (must have completed a minimum of six (6) months of performance). Also include information on three (3) recent contracts performed by each of your teaming partners and significant subcontractors that you consider most relevant in demonstrating their ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. For a description of the characteristics or aspects the Government will consider in determining recency and relevance, see Section M, Evaluation Factors, Factor 2-Past Performance Factor. When submitting past performance references, there should only be one contract, task order or delivery per reference. Contracts, task orders or delivery orders SHALL NOT be combined or bundled and submitted as one reference. Submitting past performance references in this manner may be considered as non-responsive and not considered. If you have a past performance reference that is an IDIQ contract, please ensure you have provided the correct task order number associated with that contract. This also applies to any GSA Schedule. You should list the delivery order number, not the GSA schedule number. The Government "May" consider the relevant experience of the prime with more weight than the subcontractors. L.5.2.1. Specific Content Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a limited or no confidence rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. This may allow the offeror to be considered a higher confidence candidate. For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an offeror has overcome past problems is required. Categorize the relevant information into the specific technical/management subfactors and cost/price factor used to evaluate the proposal. L.5.2.2. Organizational Structure Change History

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 75 of 82

Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this procurement. To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offerors, your "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources. L.5.2.3. PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Only references for same or similar type contracts are desired. (a) Quality and Satisfaction Rating for Contracts Completed in the Past Three Years. Provide information currently available (letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of completed product for same or similar type contract. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc. (b) Past Performance Surveys: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of no more than three (3) recent contracts that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. A contract is considered recent if performed within the last three (3) years of issuance of this solicitation (must have completed a minimum of six (6) months of performance). Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving developing the MGDS-U to comply with the National Security Agency (NSA) High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) Generic Discovery Server (GDS) Interoperability Specification (IS) Guide requirements or similar system(s) that's comparable or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to this procurement. The evaluation team may consider the offeror's past performance in aggregate (including subcontractors and joint ventures). All past performance surveys must be submitted by the customer and received by the closing date of the RFP. If partnering, must identify the prime on the survey. Furnish the following information for each contract listed: (i) Company/Division name (ii) Product/Service

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 76 of 82

(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer/Phone Number/Email Address (iv) Contract Number (v) Contract Dollar Value (vi) Period of Performance (vii) Verified, up-to-date name, address, FAX and telephone number of the contracting officer (viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions (ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contracts. (c) Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. (d) Documents submitted in response to this solicitation must be fully responsive to and consistent with the following: 1. Requirements of the solicitation (CLINs) and PWS and government standards and regulations pertaining to the PWS. 2. Evaluation Factors for Award.

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 77 of 82 Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award SECTION M

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M1. SOURCE SELECTION The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) TECHNICAL/MANAGEMENT (2) PAST PERFORMANCE (3) PRICE The technical/management factor will be evaluated as Acceptable or Unacceptable. Past Performance is significantly more important than Price when being evaluated. (a) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s). (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive selection in which competing offerors past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to the terms of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: A. Price Evaluation. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each. Copies of the Pricing Schedule will be necessary in order to submit a proposal for each Option. B. Technical Acceptability. Next, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical/management proposals submitted by the lowest seven (7) priced offerors assigning a rating of Acceptable or Unacceptable. All subfactors identified below must be evaluated as "Acceptable" to be considered for award. The proposals shall address the following subfactors: Subfactor 1: Technical Approach:

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 78 of 82

-

The offeror offer shall demonstrate and describe how the offeror will develop the MGDS-U to comply with the National Security Agency (NSA) High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) Generic Discovery Server (GDS) Interoperability Specification (IS) Guide requirements as well as how the offeror will comply and accomplish all related subtasks in the PWS. The offeror offer shall demonstrate and describe how the offeror will provide a hardware/software solution that must comply with all DODI 8500.2 IA Implementation, Certification and Accreditation (C&A) requirements (i.e. DIACAP, CRM) and support the Authority to Operate (ATO) and Authority to Connect (ATC). The offeror offer shall demonstrate and describe how the offeror will provide ownership of all hardware purchased under this contract, to include supporting documentation, to support the MGDS-U solution to be retained by the Government. Describe how the offeror will provide product integration at the government laboratory.

-

-

Subfactor 2: Management Approach: - The offeror shall provide a comprehensive sample Task Management Plan for the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Unclassified Generic Discovery Server ­ Unclassified (MGDS-U) describing the organizational resources and management controls to be employed to meet the cost, performance, and schedule requirements throughout contract execution as well as how the offeror will comply and accomplish all related subtasks in the PWS. The offeror offer shall demonstrate and describe how the offeror will provide support for Program Management Reviews (PMR), develop briefing materials, white papers, information papers, and other government specified documentation related to the MGDS-U development efforts as requested or directed by the government, conduct a System Requirements Review (SRR), support preliminary design Reviews (PDR), describe how the offeror will proceed to CDR when all exit criteria for PDR have been met.

C. Performance Confidence Assessment. The contracting officer shall then evaluate recent and relevant performance information on only the seven (7) lowest priced technically acceptable offerors based on (1) the past performance questionnaires and may evaluate (2) data independently obtained from other government sources , to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving developing the MGDS-U to comply with the National Security Agency (NSA) High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE) Generic Discovery Server (GDS) Interoperability Specification (IS) Guide requirements or similar system(s) that's comparable or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. If the Government evaluators consider the offeror's past performance reference to be recent, then the Government will assess the relevancy of the referenced past performance task order/contract. The Government determines relevancy by evaluating the past performance references against the technical factor/subfactors contained in the solicitation. The past performance factor does not contain subfactors. The past performance questionnaires (if used) and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy and quality of past performance. The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts (DoD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1, Table 1): The following relevancy definitions apply: Table 1

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 79 of 82

Relevancy Very Relevant Somewhat Relevant Not Relevant

Definition Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

D. Performance Quality Assessment (How well the contractor performed on the contract.) The Government will consider the performance quality of recent and relevant efforts. For each recent/relevant past performance reference reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the technical/management factor, subfactors and cost/price factor (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this procurement may be considered). The quality assessment consists of an indepth evaluation of the past performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS information, interviews with Government customers and fee determining officials, and if applicable, commercial clients. It may include interviews with DCMA officials or other sources known to the Government. The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings. Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system. For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problems, mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained improvements. Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated. The Government will use the following quality ratings when assessing quality of relevant contracts. (DISA Supplemental Source Selection Procedures, paragraph 3.1.3.1 (S-90), Table 2) Table 2 Past Performance Quality Assessment Quality Assessment Rating/Color Description EXCEPTIONAL (E)/BLUE During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual requirements and exceeds or exceeded many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. VERY GOOD (VG)/PURPLE During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual requirements and exceeds or exceeded some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. SATISFACTORY (S)/GREEN During the contract period, contractor performance meets or met contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory. MARGINAL (M)/YELLOW During the contract period, contractor performance does not or did

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 80 of 82

UNSATISFACTORY(U)/RED

NOT APPLICABLE (N)/WHITE

not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. During the contract period, contractor performance does not or did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery in a timely manner is not likely. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective. Unable to provide a rating. Contract did not include performance for this aspect. Do not know.

M2. ASSINGING PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. The resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the past performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of each offeror's past performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the past performance factor. More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than a less recent or relevant effort. A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating. Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in the definition table 3 below. The following confidence definitions apply: Table 3 TABLE 3- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS Rating Description

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 81 of 82

SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE

Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

LIMITED CONFIDENCE NO CONFIDENCE UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE (Neutral)

D. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation. E. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating and is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. F. In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph E above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is evaluated to have a performance assessment rating of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Contracting Officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision. G. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. H. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary. M3. COST OR PRICE FACTOR (1) For award purposes, the Government will evaluate the base and option period, to include the 6 month "option to extend services" option. Evaluation of this option shall not obligate the Government to

HC1047-13-R-0007 Page 82 of 82

exercise the option. All CLINS in the Section B/Price Schedule shall be priced and totaled in determining the total evaluated cost for award purposes. (2) The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable, realistic, and complete. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business. Normally, price reasonableness is established through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. For additional information see FAR 31.201-3. (3) The Government will evaluate the realism of each offerors' proposed costs. This will include an evaluation of the extent to which proposed costs are realistic in accordance with FAR 15.404and 2.101. When the Government evaluates an offer as unrealistically low compared to the anticipated costs of performance, offeror's failure to explain these underestimated costs, may be considered by the Government, under the technical risk rating, to demonstrate a lack of understanding of the technical/management requirements of the applicable technical/management subfactor. M.4 DISCUSSIONS The Government intends to make award without entering discussions.
