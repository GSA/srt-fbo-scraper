Form SOW 1. General: The contractor is to provide an emergency mass notification system which will include, but is not limited to, the following general requirements:

1.1 1.3 1.4

Implement a system in which we are able to reach out and contact our customers during emergencies.
1.2 Decrease notification times and broaden the scope of contact.

Create a system that is not subject to the constraints, restrictions and policies that apply to the Emergency Address System (PA system). Broaden our capabilities to include the ability to contact our customers outside of the facility.
1.5 Improve the overall effectiveness and flexibility of the emergency management process.

2. Concept of Operations: These systems are designed to allow participants to designate a combination of home telephone, cellular phone or e-mail address on which they wish to receive an emergency notification. There is no PII issue since each individual participant controls their own personal information and there is no way for others to view or access the database. While participation is voluntary, informal surveys conducted during annual Emergency Plans training show that the vast majority of HDIFC occupants would elect to participate if such a system were available. 3. Specific Requirements: In the interest of creating an agile and flexible emergency mass notification system for the Hart-DoleInouye Federal Center (HDIFC), Emergency Operations Center and the employees, in keeping with recommendations by experts in the field of emergency management and nation- wide trends by emergency managers and to be compliant with DOD 6055.17 Instruction the following specific requirements must be met: 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 1500 users (minimum) Price is all inclusive to provide complete coverage including platform fees Secure Web site for users use (https://www) WEB based company owned platform No hardware or software to install Participants are responsible for maintaining their own data

"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the SAM database" means that-- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; (2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and

(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active".

(3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM. (c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.

A contractor may obtain a DUNS number--

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to--
