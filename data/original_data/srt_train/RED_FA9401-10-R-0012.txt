Questions and Answers for Solicitation FA9401-10-R-0012, Information Technology Services Support 5 November 2010 Question 1: When will Questions and Answers be posted for Solicitation FA9401-10-R-0012? Questions and Answers will be posted every Wednesday by 12:00 PM (MST) Question 2: Where is the PWS that is supposed to be Attachment # 1? Performance Work Statement, dated 29 Oct 2010 has been posted. Question 3: Is this a new requirement or a re-compete for work already being done? The current contract was acquired through Network-Centric Solutions (NETCENTS). Please note that the Performance Work Statement for this solicitation reflects requirements not on the current contract. Question 4: If this is a re-compete, who is the incumbent? Incumbent: Telos Corporation, Contract FA8771-04-D-0009, R301, Award Date: 12 Dec 2005, Award Amount: $509,159.64 Question 5: The current documents do not provide enough information on which to judge the number of personnel that we will need to have on site to meet Government requirements. Will the Government provide an estimated staffing plan - We realize that it will be up to us to decide on the number of personnel needed to meet these requirements? This is a Performance Based Service contract and the Government will not dictate staffing for success on the contract. The current contract has 6 (six) incumbent personnel. Question 6: There seems to be a slight discrepancy on the DD Form 254. Block 10a states that the contractor will NOT have access to COMSEC and yet the first three paragraphs to the attachment to the DD254 are devoted to COMSEC requirements. Request clarification. The DD 254 is correct. 10a is marked as "NO" for Communications Security (COMSEC) Information. The attachments provide additional information if a particular security access is required.
