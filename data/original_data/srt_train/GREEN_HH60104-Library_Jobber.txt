1.0   INTRODUCTION

1.1.  The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by
      providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 76,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  The number
      of students varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide.  DoDEA’s curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on
      standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools.

1.2   DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas.  DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers seven states, Puerto
      Rico, and Cuba.  DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into DoDDS-Europe and DoDDS-Pacific.  The former consists of
      England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Bahrain.  The latter consists of Korea, Japan, and Guam.

1.3   DoDEA has adopted the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), whose curriculum standards are rigorous, research-based, and reflect the
      knowledge and skills that our students need for success in college and careers.

2.0   BACKGROUND

2.1   Every DoDEA school has a school library information center, which have unique materials collection needs based on curriculum requirements
      and student age/ grade-level.


3.0   SCOPE

3.1   DoDEA requires customizable information center materials selection and acquisition services (library materials provider/book jobber) to
      ensure that the collection needs of each school library information center are met.  The selection and acquisition services shall include a
      customizable web-based selection and acquisition tool, pre-processing, Machine-Readable-Cataloguing (MARC) records, shipping, invoicing,
      data/reports management, technical support, and related professional development.

3.2   School library information center materials include:

      ▪ eBooks; electronic books intended to be viewed on-screen or on portable devices.
      ▪ Books; trade, technical, reference, paperback, library- and vendor-bound.
      ▪ Multimedia; CD-ROM, DVD, and mixed media sets.
      ▪ Printed barcodes, labels, and label cover.
      ▪ Audio Books; electronic books that include sound and that are intended to be heard via computer audio, portable devices, or within a
        self-contained listening device.





3.3   The dollar amount of book orders has varied significantly over the last five years, ranging from several million dollars to over six
      million dollars per year, depending on individual school needs and on the availability of funds.  DoDEA expects that the total dollar value
      of materials ordered will vary from year to year but that the total value over the 6-year life of the contract will be approximately $18
      million.

Attachment 6 – Provisions and Clauses Incorporated by Full Text/And Addendum to FAR clauses

The following solicitation provisions, clauses and addenda are incorporated by full text and apply to this acquisition:

52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)

 (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals—

(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;

(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local)
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);

(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the
offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;

(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds
$3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a
proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to
the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying
tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final
tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.
(2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

  This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or
  Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)


52.209-7   INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (July 2013)
a) Definitions. As used in this provision—
“Administrative proceeding” means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability
(e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board

it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of

performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any
of the following dispositions:
(i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.
(ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement,
restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more.
(iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in—
(A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or
(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.
(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by
the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this
provision.
(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror
has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence.
(d) The offeror shall post the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through
maintaining an active registration in the System for Award Management database via https://www.acquisition.gov (see 52.204-7).

    2. EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor(s) whose offer conforming to the
solicitation will be most advantageous (provide the best value) to the Government, price/discount and other factors considered.  The following
factors, in order of importance, shall be used to evaluate the offers: Technical Capability Statement and Oral Presentation/Demonstration, Past
Performance, and Price/Discount Level.    When combined Technical Capability Statement and Oral Presentation/Demonstration and Past Performance
are significantly more important than Price/Discount Level.  Specifically, the Government is using Best Value Basis and Trade-Off Procedures for
this procurement.

      Pass-Fail Criterion: The eBook Platform, Web-based Selection and Acquisition tool, MARC and Professional Development shall meet DoDEA’s
information security requirements for online resources as specified in the Statement of Work (SOW) 5.0-5.6.

      • Pass: The Web-based Selection and Acquisition tool meets DoDEA’s technology requirements.

      • Fail: The Web-based Selection and Acquisition tool does not meet DoDEA’s technology requirements. Offers that fails will not be
        evaluated further.


      Evaluation Factors:


      Factor 1: Technical Capability Statement and Oral Presentation/Demonstration.  Vendors’ technical offers (without price proposal) and
presentations will be evaluated by the Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) on how well they demonstrate their ability to provide the requirement as
set forth in the Statement of Work, as well as on the general quality of the proposed products and services, using the sub-factors below:


        1) Sub-Factor 1: Web-based Selection and Acquisition Tool.
        2) Sub-Factor 2: Ebooks circulating and managing
        3) Sub-Factor 3: MARC Records.
        4) Sub-Factor 4: Pre-processing and Shipping and Invoice
        5) Sub-Factor 5: Expenditure Reports
        6) Sub-Factor 6: Technical Support
        7) Sub-Factor 7: Professional Development


      Factor 2:  Past Performance: Vendor’s Past Performance referrals, documentation submittals, Past Performance Information Retrieval System
(PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), or other databases, will be evaluated to determine the vendor’s
likelihood of success on the present requirement.  Using the following sub-factors below:


     1) Sub-Factor 1: Quality of product or service
     2) Sub-Factor 2: Customer Service
     3) Sub-Factor 3: Shipping Capability
     4) Overall satisfaction of performance/service, and training


      Factor 3:  Price/Discount: Price/Discount will be evaluated by the Contracting Officer to determine price fairness and reasonableness
through price and discount comparisons of offered prices and discounts.  Price and discounts will be considered by the Government when
determining the best value offer.


(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the
basic requirement and accumulative discounts.  This evaluation will include an option to extend services for 6 months (as allowed by FAR 52.217-
8), to run after the completion of the last annual option period. The Government will extrapolate the vendor’s pricing of the last annual option
period to arrive at a price for the potential six (6) month extension of services option. The Government may determine that an offer is
unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the
option(s).


(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a proposal, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for
acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified
expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a
written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Addendum to Provision:


(d) If any component of the contractor’s offer is not acceptable to the Government, then the Government may reject the offer without further
evaluation.


(e) Section 508.  Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the Proposal adequately
addresses the requirements for Section 508.

Attachment 8 – Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT)

|Section 508 (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=policies)requires that federal agencies electronic and information technology is    |
|accessible to people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and |
|information technology.                                                                                                                     |
|Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d)                                      |
|(http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=1998Amend) are determined as applicable to this acquisition based on the following technical    |
|provisions: To understand the technical standards that apply to each provision, the respondent should refer to http://Section 508.gov at    |
|http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsdoc.                                                                                         |
|This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated|
|with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation |
|respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements.          |
|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard.        |
|Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT          |
|requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition |
|have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics          |
|corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement  |
|applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.                                                                       |
|The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding |
|to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as     |
|defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information  |
|content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.                                                                                         |
|Please fill the information below as a part of request for accessibility information of your proposed deliverable.                          |

Government Product/Service Accessibility Template for eBooks


Summary

       • Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each
         Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.
       • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be
         features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable
         includes additional features, the accessibility of these features also must be considered.
       • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
         deliverable.
       • Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
         Standard.
       • Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
         applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.
    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.

Government Product Accessibility Template for Web Application


Summary

       • Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each
         Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.
       • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be
         features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable
         includes additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.
       • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
         deliverable.
       • Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
         Standard.
       • Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
         applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.
