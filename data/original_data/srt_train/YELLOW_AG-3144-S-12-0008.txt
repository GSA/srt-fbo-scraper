Service Level Agreement 

Between MicroPact, Inc.

and 

United States Department of Agriculture 

Natural Resources Conservation Service

Date: 

Version 2.0

















SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT 





SECTION 1 – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS.  

This Service Level Agreement is for the development and production hosting of an suite of applications using MicroPact, entellitrak software, and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) data and web services from the ProTracts/FundManager, Service Center Information Management System (SCIMS), Where Am I, ProTracts/FundManager, National Conservation Planning Database and potential other NRCS databases. The entellitrak environmental mainframe is required to quickly develop, web-based, applications that NRCS will pre-load with existing or new data, enabling the States and National Headquarters to add, modify, clean up and ensure completeness of the data. 



The first basic deliverable was a web-based system, requiring USDA EAuthentication access, which allows NRCS staff to manage their Wetland Reserve Program (WRP), Farm and Ranch Protection Program (FRPP), Emergency Watershed Protection Program Flood Plain Easements (EWP-FPE), and Emergency Wetland Reserve Program (EWRP) application and agreement programmatic data. NRCS will be able to 1) complete and edit existing applications and agreements for WRP, EWRP, FRPP, and EWPP-FPEs, 2) add, edit, or delete new applications, and 3) evaluate and process existing applications, if eligible, into agreements. Also, for FRPP, the user must be able to add and manage additional parcels for existing agreements.



The application has interfaced with the Service Center Information Management System (SCIMS), under the control of the Farm Service Agency (FSA), with NRCS inherited security system authorization along with the NRCS Vendor database process.  The application is capable of accepting data from the existing Interim Easement Data Entry Tool, which is a SQLServer database-based application.  The delivered applications have undergone a full Certification and Accreditation process signed off through an ATO by the Department of Agriculture.



The agility of the entellitrak software allows NRCS to modify the configurations to front a host of web-based data tools under the existing secure framework.  Additional applications are the Easement Tool, Audit Tracking Tool, Emergency Watershed Program, Appeals and Equitable Relief Database, and the Resource Based Performance Planning tool.

SECTION 2 – ANNUAL SYSTEM SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS.  

Security features including eAuthenication and a MicroPact’s firewall. The schemas are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data and all the systems being interconnected.  Entellitrak has its own roles based engine that integrates an identity management/permission access to each application.  The National Program Manager and Project Manager review and maintain the active roster/access.  The application’s National Program Manager is the access controller.

A. General Information/Data Description



MicroPact, Inc.






USDA - NRCS





B. Services Offered

The Natural Resources Conservation Service has requested MicroPact services to build an entellitrak application to create, store, manage, and host the Conservation Easements data.  The NRCS entellitrak easements system will have the functional requirement to pull data from the web services of the Natural Resources Conservation Service and Farm Service Agency (FSA).



MicroPact is providing general computational services (GSS), and the NRCS Easements custom application, via their ‘entellitrak’ software product.  All phases of the SDLC (analysis through production), system support and maintenance will be provided by MicroPact.  Through this SLA, NRCS is providing access to the application ‘FundManager’ vendor data, National Conservation Planning Database, SCIMS search page, SCIMS web services, and the ‘Where Am I’ GIS web service.  All application data, derived or actual, will be stored and maintained in the MicroPact GSS.





C. Data Sensitivity

Data handled through this agreement is Sensitive-But-Unclassified, covered by the Privacy Act and Section 1619 of the 2008 Farm Bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008).

USDA - NRCS





D. User Community

The community users will have USDA Level II eAuth. The restricted users have been granted access by the National NRCS Easements and Landscape Division and/or Division at large to develop and manage their applications and contracts.  The NEST user community will have the ability to maintain data within the Wetland Reserve Program, Grassland Reserve Program, Farm and Ranchland Protection Program, and Healthy Forests Reserve Program as their programs expand.






E. Information Exchange Security

Security is provided by the use of https, firewalls, and network protection, which are in place to secure the exchange of information/data among and between the systems in question.  Access Control, Audit and Accountability, and System and Communications Protection will be provided by MicroPact through the features of the entellitrak application.  Identification and Authentication will be provided via an entellitrak call to the USDA eAuthentication system. Section 3 visually describes network architecture to keep the operations within a secure hosting environment.

F. Trusted Behavior Expectations

entellitrak employs a multilayered system to protect all hardware from any form of illicit external access.  All systems are positioned behind a FIPS compliant firewall which provides real-time Antivirus scanning as well as IPS.  All traffic from the firewall is logged on an internal syslog server.  At the server level, up-to-date Antivirus Software must be implemented for additional layers of AV, IPS and malware defense.  All production server logs are also monitored for inappropriate access/use of the system and MicroPact and NRCS Administrators are automatically notified of any occurrences.



NRCS is expected to perform authentication and  of all users of the applications that use the entellitrak service.  Users of the application built with the entellitrak software will be required to obtain appropriate Level II eAuthentication credentials, according to established USDA guidelines and procedures.  Applications built on the entellitrak software will require the user to provide eAuthentication credentials in order run the authorization/permissions based application and access NRCS Customer data.







G. Formal Security Policy



MicroPact, Inc.







USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service





H. Incident Reporting

NRCS will report incidents according to existing USDA, Office of the Chief Information Officer, Information Technology Services (ITS), “Incident Reporting, Handling, and Response Security Procedures Guide” (ITS8000-01) dated May 31, 2005 and NRCS policy.  At the discretion of the Incident Manager, MicroPact will be contacted.

MicroPact will keep a log of all incidents and actions taken, which can be accessed online. MicroPact will provide the NRCS with login information to access this log. USDA and NRCS Cyber Security will be notified immediately of security incidents as required.  A carbon copy of the report will need to be stored in CoLab by the Project Manager.

 

I. Audit Trail Responsibilities

Both parties are responsible for auditing application processes and user activities involving the interconnection.  Activities that will be recorded include event type, date and time of event, user identification, workstation identification, success or failure of access attempts, and security actions taken by system administrators or security officers.  Audit logs must be retained for the minimum NARA requirement, at least three (3) years.

NRCS relies on the auditing capabilities of eAuthentication to track user access and authorization.

MicroPact will use an internal logging system to track user access statistics.



J. Security Parameters

Users of the entellitrak tools must have Level II eAuthentication first, then role-based permissions within the entellitrak NRCS applications.  Users will not be able to directly access the system.  Each entellitrak tool will have a separate and distinct access system which are reviewed and updated a minimum monthly and a maximum quarterly.



K. Operational Security Mode

MicroPact: protection level 2 Medium.  NRCS operates in a System-High mode of operation, which requires all users to have the following:

Proper clearance for ALL information on the system.

Formal access approval for ALL information on the system.

A valid need to know for ALL information on the system.



L. Training and Awareness

Both parties shall identify & train personnel that have significant information system security roles and responsibilities specifically for the interconnection between the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and MicroPact for the express purpose of exchanging data between the National Conservation Planning (NCP), SCIMS Web Service owned by NRCS and FSA, and the entellitrak system owned by MicroPact.

. 

M. Specific Equipment Restrictions

Equipment restrictions will not be used by either interconnected system.



N. Dial-Up Connectivity

No Dial-up Connections.





O. Security Documentation

Both parties shall develop and implement a security plan for the information system that provides an overview of the security requirements for the system and a description of the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.  All documentation shall be updated at least annually and approved by the Designated Accrediting Authority within NRCS and MicroPact.  Additionally, all documentation shall be made available to NRCS upon request.

Comments: NRCS and FSA have an existing agreement with the data share of SCIMS web services.  NRCS will maintain the liability and security policy controls.

This email (4/6/2010) is to document the agreement between NRCS and FSA on issues relating to the NRCS use of a vendor to host NRCS applications at a vendor site:



FSA has agreements with NRCS to share data and services.  The existing Interagency agreements between NRCS and FSA are the responsibility of NRCS to enforce with any vendor that NRCS chooses to engage in the hosting or delivery of web applications.  NRCS is responsible for the agreements with the NRCS vendors.  As long as the vendors enforce the same agreements (as NRCS) in protecting access to data and safeguarding data and IT resources then the existing agreements between FSA and NRCS are sufficient to cover access to shared services and shared data.



FSA is responsible for enforcing adequate protection for FSA services and data provided under the agreements.  NRCS and the NRCS vendor must follow the security provisions implemented by FSA (including limiting access to authorized users, role based security, XML gateway to limit access to recognized and authorized servers, ensuring data is encrypted during transfer, incident reporting, etc.)

Software Development Lifecycle Guide   

 Overview 
  A Software Development Lifecycle is an iterative process for information technology system  development whose goal is to ensure the production of highquality software that meets the needs  of the end users within a predictable schedule and budget.    The USDA NRCS Software Development Lifecycle is guidance to the various organizations towards the  goal of achieving a consistent and successful software project in compliance with agency,  department and federal regulations.  The SDLC will describe important elements of software  development in a clear and consistent way. Earned Value Management (EVM) is an integrated  component of the SDLC that allows for an objective measurement of project progress combining  scope, schedule and cost.    The SDLC is segmented into eight chapters or phases that roughly follow the Project Management  Institute's Project Lifecycle Definition: Initiation, Requirements, Design, Development, Test,  Deployment, Maintenance and End of Life.  The SDLC also utilizes key elements from RUP, Agile and  other methodologies to create a consistent approach to software development at the NRCS.  This  standard approach results in the production of quality software that is well documented and meets  the end users' needs.    Organizations that contribute to the lifecycle are:  Business Sponsors, Project Managers,  Architecture, Development, Quality Assurance, Security Operations, Controls, and Production  Operations.  Each of these groups has a role to play throughout the phases of the SDLC.   

Format of This Document 
  This document is organized in a drilldown process  an highlevel overview of the SDLC is expanded  to responsibilities for each organization throughout the process to the detailed level of deliverables,  dependencies, and artifacts used by each organization.   

Supplemental Material 
  In addition to this guidance document, NRCS will provide Templates and a Quick Start Guide in an  external format.    Appendices have references to external material including template references, examples of  deliverables, and checklists.

Minor Releases

Change Requests (CRs) represent the functional or technical adjustments to be made to the application or system. One or more of these CRs will be dedicated to a Minor Release. A Minor Release is intended to deliver a functional and/or technical adjustment (CRs) to the application(s) or system(s) to satisfy stakeholder requirements. A minor release will typically be represented by one decimal place in the release identifier for the application or system, e.g. 2.2 or 7.8. The point two and point eight respectively identify that the release is the second or eighth minor release since the last major release.  



There will be no more than one minor release per month. 



A Minor Release includes CRs and is obviously functional and/or technical in nature, based on the CRs, but often also has database adjustments and configuration adjustments which are both also other classes of releases and can be found in other sections of this Subtask as well.



The contractor will either work through the COR and Government Team to implement the release to schedule the downtime for the release and inform the user community and stakeholders. The contractor will check in the code, both compiled and un-compiled, to the code repository. The contractor shall deliver a document that briefly identifies the changes or adjustments to be implemented in the release in the form of “Release Notes”. The contractor shall also deliver a document that identifies the steps to be implemented in order to test the CRs in the form of “Test Cases”. Included within each Minor Release is a brief adjustment to the training manuals and guides to update any new information which identifies information from the release. If the release does not impact the document no change shall be required.



The contractor shall ensure that a backup of all components has been made and is available before engaging the release activities or the Configuration Management Team. The contractor will verify that the Release was successfully deployed and inform the CO or COR. If the Release was not successfully deployed the contractor shall notify the CO or COR. They will make an immediate decision to either roll back to the previous state or enact an Emergency Release.



Minor Releases must have at least one week (five business days) for the government to perform User Acceptance Testing of the features prior to the release.



Major Releases

Major Releases will be tasked at a much less frequent rate than minor releases and will generally not be requested with greater frequency than two per year.



The three major release types are defined as:

Application update

Platform upgrade

Deploying a new module/application



The major releases anticipated to be required so far are:



FY 2012 – 2 (NEST phase 3 – A&ER)

FY 2013 – 2 (NEST phase 4 – TBA)

FY 2014 – 2 (TBA1 phase 2 – TBA2)

FY 2015 – 2 (TBA2 phase 2 – TBA3)

FY 2016 – 2 (TBA3 phase 2 – TBA4)



Major Releases must have at least two weeks (ten business days) for the government to perform User Acceptance Testing of the features prior to the release. 



Emergency Releases

An unanticipated flaw in any of the prior releases, a newly discovered defect, or a new vulnerability may provide good cause to implement an Emergency Release. Emergency Releases are developed, tested and implemented as quickly as possible to minimize the impact to the user community. The form of the emergency release is that the application, database and/or configuration changes are developed and tested immediately and, once approved are incorporated into the production environment. Emergency releases may require a branch off of the current release track.



There would be one emergency release per year.

SUBJECT: USDA Synopsis/Request for Quotations (RFQ) AG-3144-S-12-0008

Dear Interested Small Business Vendor,

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with
additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written
solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation is being issued as a small-business set-aside under  NAICS  541512  –  Computer  Systems  Integrator  Services  (Size  Standard
$25.5M).

      FAR Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 15 policies and procedures will be used to solicit, evaluate and  award  the  resulting  contract.
      This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC05-58, April
      18, 2012.

United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) anticipates awarding a  firm-fixed  price  contract
for Entellitrak License Renewals, Hosting, and Operations and Maintenance Support Services with options for additional licenses.

This solicitation will result in a base one (1) year contract with  four  (4)  one  (1)  year  option  periods  awarded  to  the  single  offeror
representing the best value to the government.

This solicitation utilizes a Performance Work Statement (PWS) describing  the  needs  of  the  Agency  in  terms  of  results,  constraints,  and
presenting a potential solution for functional vision  purposes  only.   This  format  reduces  the  inherent  instructions  regarding  “how”  to
accomplish the work typically found in a Statement of Work; vendors should present their individual solutions, accomplishing the objectives  that
have been proven at agencies or commercial organizations with similar environments and requirements as the USDA.

The evaluation for this award will be based on Price and Past Performance ONLY.  Both factors will have equal weight.

It is the USDA’s goal to ensure evaluations are as streamlined as possible so a complete quote that is responsive to the evaluation  criteria  is
paramount.  If you have questions about the past performance/price trade-off process, how to submit your quote,  or  other  areas  regarding  the
mechanics of the solicitation and quotation process please contact the Contracting Officer and we may discuss any  areas  within  the  limits  of
what is already presented in the solicitation.

Past performance volumes should be carefully developed and fully contain  performance  summaries  demonstrating  how  the  offeror  has  provided
relevant high quality services for other organizations similar to NRCS within the past 3 years. (Past Performance)

It is incumbent on the vendor to present the past performance most applicable to the USDA environment and describe it sufficiently for  the  USDA
to have confidence that the vendor will successfully fulfill each requirement requested for this effort.  These  descriptions  will  be  verified
through customer provided questionnaires and other direct follow-up methods.

The resulting contract will be entirely firm-fixed price.  The USDA has made every attempt to make this type  of  contract  plausible  given  the
nature of the requirement.  If there are any areas your firm does not  feel  able  to  provide  a  firm-fixed  price  quote  please  contact  the
Contracting Officer prior to the question submission deadline and explain the information required for your firm to make such an offer.

Please send questions regarding the solicitation to jason.kattman@ftc.usda.gov.  All written questions must be received  no  later  than  4:30PM,
Mountain Standard Time May 18th, 2012.

The closing date for receipt of all volume submissions is to 4:30PM Mountain Standard Time, May 25th, 2012.

If there are any discrepancies between the information outlined in the summary  letter  above  and  the  contents  of  the  RFQ,  the  RFQ  takes
precedence.  Likewise, if there are areas of this RFQ package that are not clear please contact the Contracting Officer prior to  quote  closing.
If the requirements are misinterpreted by the contractor, there is no entitlement to compensation for additional  costs  incurred  in  performing
any extra work required to meet the standard established in the contract.

Thank you in advance, we look forward to reviewing your submission!

Sincerely,
[pic]

Special Requirements Applicable to this Contract:

Security Requirements
      The contractor is required to provide services successfully throughout the entire period of performance.  Lack of cleared personnel will
      not absolve the contractor from its responsibility to successfully complete the objectives of this requirement.  It is the contractor’s
      responsibility to provide cleared personnel for this effort from the start of the contract.

      In order to gain access to USDA computer networks and computers, Contractor personnel are required to successfully complete the following
      requirements including, but not necessarily limited to:
      • The USDA Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training (web or paper based).  Additional and/or different courses may be
        required as USDA and NRCS security policy changes.
      • The instructions contained in guidelines to obtain Level 2 USDA E-Gov access (eAuthentication).
      • The documentation required for a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) which includes FBI National Criminal History Check (“fingerprint
        check”).   The finger printing will be completed at no cost to the Government.
      • Information needed to obtain a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.

      The scope of the security/background check required and the forms to be completed shall be determined in accordance with the USDA Directive
      4620 series.  The Government sponsor for this process shall be the COR or Government representative appointed in writing by the CO.  The
      Contractor shall be responsible for the preparation and submittal of the required forms to the Human Resources official.  The Contractor
      personnel shall not be required or permitted to perform work prior to receipt of the required security approvals.

      Contract personnel who have access to USDA networks and computers will be required to take all security training necessary as determined by
      the Government to maintain access to the USDA network and computers.  Currently, this includes an annual two hour, web-based, Information
      Security Awareness training module and one other specialized training identified by NRCS Security per USDA policy.  As USDA security policy
      changes, additional and/or different courses may be required. The time required to take the required annual training shall be at Government
      expense and charged as determined by the COR.  Contractor roles and permissions will be reviewed by the Government with the same frequency
      and at the same level as government employees.  Access to government facilities, networks, and computers will require Contractors to follow
      all government mandated security alerts, procedures, patches, and upgrades.

PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES (Mar 2006)
     a) Before an employee may begin work on this contract, each employee must, as directed by the PIV Sponsor:
        1. Complete either a SF-85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, or SF-86,

BASIS OF AWARD



EVALUATION


(a) The Government will award an contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

The following subjective weights apply to each evaluation factor.

         • Past Performance:            Equal
         • Price                  Equal

Price and Past Performance will be treated as approximately equal areas and may be traded off, one against the other, as addressed below.


Past Performance:



The application of the PPT technique in the contract award and selection and approval process is as follows:

All offerors will receive a performance confidence assessment rating as defined in the table titled Past Performance Confidence Assessment
Section, below.

(1).  If the lowest evaluated price offeror has also received a substantial performance confidence rating, this offeror’s quote represents the
best value for this acquisition and award shall be made to this offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination.

(2).  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest evaluated price offeror if the low offeror receives other
than a substantial confidence performance confidence rating.  In these cases, price and past performance are both treated as approximately equal
areas and may be traded off, one against the other. The source selection authority shall make an assessment of the price proposed and the
performance confidence rating assigned and trade one off for the other to determine the best value for the Government.

Past Performance Confidence Assessment:

SUBMIT THE DOCUMENTS IDENTIFIED IN
THE ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1, PAST PERFORMANCE

      Definitions:

      “Performance confidence assessment” is an evaluation of the likelihood (or government’s confidence) that the offeror will successfully
      complete the solicitation’s requirements; the evaluation is based upon past performance.

      "Performance Confidence Assessment Group (PCAG)" is a group of experienced government personnel assigned to accomplish the Performance
      Confidence Assessment.

     1) Performance Confidence will be evaluated in accordance with the information presented below.  In assessing past performance, the
        evaluators will employ several approaches including:
           a) Reviewing the experience listed in the quote.
           b) Seeking additional present and past performance information through the use of simplified questionnaires, and
           c) Using data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources such as the Contractor Performance Assessment
              Reporting System (CPARS).


     2) The offeror’s past performance will be evaluated through the accomplishment of a confidence assessment rating based on aspects of the
        offeror’s recent and relevant past performance and quality of performance, focusing on and targeting performance that is relevant to
        this project as defined in the table titled Past Performance Confidence Assessment below.  For each contract submitted under Past
        Performance, the Government will make a determination of whether the contract is Recent and then will assess an overall Relevancy and
        Quality rating for each contract.  The offeror will not receive an overall relevancy or quality rating, but the individual relevancy and
        quality ratings for each contract will be considered in determining the overall Confidence rating the offeror receives.


           a) Recency:  Recent performance is defined as the offeror's previous experience within the past three years from the issuance date of
              this RFQ.


           b) Relevancy:  The Source Selection Authority will consider performance information for relevancy in the performance of contractor’s
              previous efforts similar, in terms of the magnitude of effort and complexities, to this solicitation.

              (i)  Relevancy will also consider such things as contracts or programs involving performing support as outlined in the objectives
              and activities described in the Statement of Objectives.  NOTE: The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.

              (ii)  The following definitions apply to determining relevancy.

           c) Quality of Performance:  The quality of performance will be assessed using the quality definitions below:

|  QUALITY OF PERFORMANCE                                                                                                                       |
|Rating                                      |Description                                                                                      |
|EXCEPTIONAL (E)                             |Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the customer's benefit. The       |
|                                            |contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few   |
|                                            |minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.       |
|VERY GOOD (VG)                              |Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the customer's benefit. The       |
|                                            |contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some  |
|                                            |minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.              |
|SATISFACTORY (S)                            |Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or        |
|                                            |sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor    |
|                                            |appear or were satisfactory.                                                                     |
|MARGINAL (M)                                |Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the      |
|                                            |element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not|
|                                            |yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally      |
|                                            |effective or were not fully implemented.                                                         |
|UNSATISFACTORY (U)                          |Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely   |
|                                            |manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains serious problem(s) for|
|                                            |which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.                            |
|UNKNOWN (N/A)                               |Did not observe performance in this area.                                                        |

              (i)  In addition to evaluating the extent to which the Offeror's performance meets basic contract requirements, the assessment
              will consider things such as the Offeror's history of adhering to schedules, (including administrative aspects of performance),
              reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally, the contractor's business-like concern
              for the interest of the customer.

           d) The past performance assessment process will result in an overall confidence rating using the ratings identified below.  This
              confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team’s judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully
              accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past performance.  If adverse past performance
              is received, the offeror will be afforded an opportunity to address the adverse information unless the information is obtain
              through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS)(in which case the offeror has already had an opportunity to
              respond).

|Rating                                      |Description                                                                                      |
|SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE                      |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror|
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE                     |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror    |
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|LIMITED CONFIDENCE                          |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror |
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|NO CONFIDENCE                               | Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror   |
|                                            |will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                                        |
|UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE                          |No performance record is identifiable or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no   |
|                                            |confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.                                         |

     3) Subcontractor Evaluation:  The performance confidence of subcontractors will be evaluated following the same procedures as for the
        prime.  Subcontractor performance confidence will then be factored into the offeror's performance confidence based upon the level of
        effort of the subcontractor.


     4) Subcontractor Consent:  Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the
        subcontractor’s consent.  Provide with the quote a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the
        requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.

     5) Clarifications:  Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote (for example, the relevance of past performance
        information), or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.
        Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation
        element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Exchanges conducted with regard to adverse
        past performance or, to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right
        to award a contract without the opportunity for quote revision.



Price:


The government shall evaluate all offers by total price.  An offeror’s total price will be determined by adding all fixed priced deliverables
across all CLINs/option periods together culminating to the total evaluated price.


AWARD NOTICE/ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER:


A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer emailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer shall result in a binding agreement without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.


END OF SOLICITATION
