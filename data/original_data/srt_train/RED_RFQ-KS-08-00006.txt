SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of funds and solicits from eligible entities project proposals to receive financial assistance through the Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) program. CARE is a unique community-based, community-driven, multimedia demonstration program designed to help communities understand and reduce risks due to toxics and environmental pollutants from all sources. The CARE grant program works with the eligible entities to help their communities form collaborative partnerships, develop a comprehensive understanding of the many sources of risk from toxics and environmental pollutants, set priorities, and identify and carry out projects to reduce risks through collaborative action at the local level. CARE's long-term goal is to help communities build self-sustaining, community-based partnerships that will continue to improve human health and local environments into the future. This is the fourth year requesting proposals for the CARE grant program; the first was in the spring of 2005. The objective of the CARE grant program is to work collaboratively within the community to investigate the effectiveness of the CARE process--whether this cross-Agency, multi-media program provides greater environmental benefits than either non-collaborative or single media approaches. EPA will award two types of cooperative agreements (Level I and Level II) under this solicitation as part of the CARE grant program.  Level I cooperative agreements will support the following types of activities: working

with the funded entity to form community-based collaborative partnerships; developing a comprehensive understanding of the many sources of risk from toxics and environmental pollutants; and setting community risk reduction priorities.  Level II cooperative agreements will fund activities to identify and demonstrate actual risk reduction projects "on the ground" in their community. Level II agreements are for communities that have already completed the actions typically taken in a Level I agreement. However, receipt of a Level I cooperative agreement is not a prerequisite to receiving a Level II cooperative agreement. FUNDING/AWARDS: The financial assistance obtained through this solicitation will be awarded as a two-year cooperative agreement. The total estimated funding expected for all awards under this solicitation is approximately $3.5 million for FY 2008.  EPA anticipates awarding 5 ­ 10 Level I cooperative agreements ranging in approximate value from $75,000 to $100,000. Most Level I agreements are expected to be funded at the level of about $90,000 with a maximum value of $100,000. (See Section III.B., Threshold Eligibility Requirements).  EPA also anticipates awarding 6 ­ 8 Level II cooperative agreements ranging in approximate value from $150,000 to $300,000. Most Level II agreements are expected to be funded at about $275,000 with a maximum value of $300,000. (See Section III.B., Threshold Eligibility Requirements.) The CARE grant program is very competitive. In the 2007 competition, 130 applications were received and 17 projects were funded. EPA reserves the right to increase or decrease (including to zero) the total number of cooperative agreements awarded for each level, or change the ratio of Level I to Level II agreements it awards. Such changes may be necessary as a response to the quality of applications received by EPA, the amount of the funds awarded to the selected applicants, or budget availability. CONTENTS BY SECTION I.

A. Background EPA developed the CARE program in response to community requests for help in addressing environmental concerns and in recognition of the need for a new approach to help communities develop locally-led solutions to address these concerns. While national regulatory approaches have resulted in significant reductions in toxic releases and other environmental improvements, these methods have not always been effective in addressing specific community concerns and cumulative risks resulting from toxic releases from multiple and often diffuse sources. CARE is designed to complement national regulatory approaches and meet community needs by building the capacity of communities to understand and take effective actions at the local level to address existing environmental concerns. The CARE program will provide funding, information, training, technical support, and help to build collaborative local partnerships, improved access to voluntary programs and address community environmental concerns. This help will focus on building the communities' capacity to understand and reduce the risks from toxics and environmental pollutants in all environmental media. Since the first round of CARE grants in 2005, EPA has already provided over $8 million in funding for 51 projects: 32 Level I and 19 Level II cooperative agreements. Two communities have graduated from Level I to Level II cooperative agreements. This is the fourth CARE solicitation. Because each solicitation has been similar to the previous three years, applicants may find it useful to go to the CARE Web site (www.epa.gov/care) and read the descriptions of the existing CARE projects. Note, however, that there has been some evolution to the CARE grant solicitation over time, especially with regards to the threshold criteria for a Level II project, so applicants need to focus on the specific criteria in this solicitation. B. Scope of CARE Projects 1. Goals -- The goals of the CARE program are to:     Reduce exposures to toxic pollutants through collaborative action at the local level. Help communities gain an understanding of all potential sources of exposure to toxic pollutants. Work with communities to set priorities for risk reduction activities. Create self-sustaining, community based partnerships that will continue to improve the local environment.

2. Strategies -- To achieve these goals, the CARE program will use the following strategies:     Build effective collaborative partnerships that include community organizations and residents, businesses, and governments and other appropriate partners. Provide information, tools, and technical assistance to help communities understand all potential sources of exposure to toxic pollutants. Establish consensus in communities on priorities, effective action to reduce risks. Focus on action, mobilize local resources and utilize EPA voluntary programs to 3

 

implement risk reduction activities. Facilitate networking among CARE communities to share experiences and lessons learned. Build long-term community capacity to continue improving the local environment.

3. Definition of "toxics" under the CARE program: The CARE program is designed to help communities reduce toxics in their environment and solve environmental problems that affect the health and/or the environment of the people who live and/or work in the community. EPA uses the term toxics to mean environmental pollutants that cause negative health or environmental impacts. These environmental pollutants can be in any environmental media--air, water, land and/or in the indoor environment. EPA is not limiting the term toxics to chemicals listed in one or more environmental statute or regulations. For additional information please refer to the CARE Solicitation Questions and Answers. This document can be found on the CARE Web site, www.epa.gov/care. 4. Definition of "community" under the CARE program: CARE is designed to help place-based communities build collaborative partnerships that can work to understand and improve environments at the local level. The funded recipient will act as a catalyst to bring the community together and empower the community to help in the completion of the CARE projects. Since the size of local level place-based communities varies depending on the project, the CARE program is not strictly defining the term community. A community is all the people living in the same area sharing the same environment, including both residents and businesses. A community will often be in a relatively small area, but in rural locations a larger area such as a watershed would be considered a community. A tribal reservation would normally be considered a community. Eligible CARE partnerships can be formed at the neighborhood level or in larger place-based areas. However, for purposes of CARE program's focus on building capacity at the local level, New York City or watersheds the size of the Missouri or the Columbia Rivers would be considered too large to be a community. Sections of New York City or the watershed of smaller rivers would be considered communities. Moreover, a subpopulation of a community (e.g., all the schools in a specific area; or all the people of the same ethnic group; or all the people with a single occupation to the exclusion of the other people living in the same area), does not qualify as representing the entire community and a project addressing a subpopulation is not be eligible for a CARE grant. For additional information please refer to the CARE Solicitation Questions and Answers on the CARE Web site: www.epa.gov/care. 5. What we are looking for in a community-based partnership and a collaborative stakeholder group: The key to the CARE process is the community partnership. One of our goals is to work in 4


partnership with the funded entity to create a self-sustaining, community-based partnership that will continue to improve the local environment, even after the CARE cooperative agreement ends. The community-based partnership needs to include representative from all three different "sides" in a community: residents, local businesses, and local government. All three sides must work together to allow a true community-wide consensus to be created and for sustainable solutions. These members work together to get information about environmental risks, disseminate that information out to the community, collect feedback, and use a consensus-based process to make decisions. Everyone in the partnership is committed to work together to identify and address their environmental problems of concern and not point fingers at potential responsible parties. All the participants are willing to look fairly at their contribution to risk and are willing to participate in voluntary and other programs to reduce that risk. EPA realizes that this means that CARE is not appropriate for all communities. CARE requires a community where all sides are willing to work together and collaborate to produce long-term solutions. When EPA asks for a list of the applicant's "partners", EPA is asking the applicant to name the organizations/groups/local leaders/volunteers that will be part of the community stakeholder group and/or those who will work to support and lead the project. EPA is looking for a stakeholder group that represents all three "sides" of a community. EPA recognizes that there are other stakeholders in a community besides residents. local businesses, and local governments (for example colleges and universities). These other stakeholders can, and where appropriate, should be included in the stakeholder group. The three major "sides" of a community are the minimum needed for a true community-wide partnership. 6. What is a good CARE project? A good CARE project would have a partnership that reflects all aspects mentioned in the above question. In addition, the grantee, or recipient of the CARE funds, would have the capacity and ability (and preferably successful experiences) to be a catalyst and convener for the community and the partnership working to bring about a consensus within the community and not trying to drive the community to their pre-determined risks and solutions. The grantee recognizes that the project is about empowering the community to improve their environment. A good CARE project has a sound plan and ability to achieve results in helping the community identify sources of exposure to toxic pollutants and set priorities for risk reduction activities through a collaborative process (Level I); take action to reduce exposures to toxic pollutants through collaborative action (Level II); and create self-sustaining, community-based partnerships to continue to improve the local environment after the EPA grants ends (Level I and II). 7. What resources are provided by EPA through the CARE program? When recipients receive a CARE cooperative agreement, in addition to funding they may also receive: 5


 EPA Program Support: EPA will provide information about EPA programs and support to help CARE recipients use the EPA programs they select;  EPA Technical Advisor Support: EPA will provide regional technical advisory staff who will work directly with the partnership group. The technical support provided by the EPA staff will be both scientific information, such as access to databases, models and other forms of technical support to evaluate and reduce risks, and community organizational support, such as how to make partnerships work better, consensusbuilding, strategic planning, becoming self-sustaining, among other skills.  CARE National Training Workshop: CARE cooperative agreement recipients will be required to attend an annual multi-day, CARE training. Some of the training's objectives will be to help the recipient with strategic planning, cooperative agreement management, and afford numerous opportunities to network with other CARE community representatives. Expenses for this annual national training (i.e., travel, lodging, etc.) must be included, for both years of the grant, in the applicant's budget narrative proposal (see Appendix B). We do not know, at this time, where the training location will be, so proposed travel costs can be considered estimates. Previous trainings were located in Denver, Seattle, and Atlanta.  CARE Community Network: All CARE communities are networked together through regular emails, formal conference calls or other methods, so the communities can provide informal and formal support to each other, share experiences and help each other solve problems. EPA views this portion of the program as one of the keys to its success.

8. Utilization of EPA partnership programs: CARE is designed to deliver partnership programs to communities. Partnership programs in EPA include a wide variety of programs, initiatives, and activities that are based on communities and citizens taking action not required by statute or regulation. There are two major categories of partnership programs:  Category One: Participants specifically sign up for a partnership program, and must meet certain criteria to be considered members. The motivation for participation is usually based on a combination of a desire for improved environmental performance, economic savings, or improved performance and/or recognition. Examples include: EPA's WasteWise, Best Workplaces for Commuters, National Priorities for Environmental Pollutants, Performance Track, and Source Water Protection programs.  Category Two: Participants are provided information to carry out EPA's partnership programs, or to design their own approaches to reduce health risks to them or others, examples include: EPA's Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools, Integrated Pest Management, Pollution Prevention, and Make a Difference Campaign programs. 6

EPA's Web site includes a Voluntary Program Guide which lists the national EPA voluntary partnership programs that could be of use to communities. The Guide provides information on where to find the requirements for each of the programs listed. (www.epa.gov/care) 9. There are two Levels of CARE funding ­ EPA will provide CARE funding to applicants through cooperative agreements to support projects at two different levels (Level I and Level II) as follows: a. Level I CARE Funding The goal of Level I projects is to ensure, at completion, that the community has developed an effective problem solving partnership, has an understanding of toxic risks facing the community, and has reached consensus in prioritizing those risks. CARE Level I cooperative agreement funding will:  Provide assistance to applicants to create, develop and or sustain a collaborative partnership dedicated to understanding toxic risks and environmental pollutant impacts in their community. Community partnerships should be as inclusive as possible including community residents, representatives of community organizations, small and large businesses, state, tribal, local government agencies, EPA and other federal agencies, colleges and universities, and other organizations and individuals as appropriate.  Build local capacity and organizations (e.g. using the funds to develop local leaders, hold leadership-building workshops, build local networks that have long-term sustainability, build local environmental coalitions that can aid local environmental agencies, and environmental solution implementation.)  Assist broad-based partnerships, with technical support from EPA, states, and other partners;  Identify all sources of toxics and environmental pollutants in the community (however, CARE funding cannot be used for surveys of more than 9 people by the recipient. CARE funding can pay for the assessment of survey data), perform a multimedia screening level assessment of the risks from them, and work to help determine community priorities for risk reduction. **An example of a model for doing this prioritization is the PACE-EH process (http://pace.naccho.org/DownloadPage.asp ) b. Level II CARE Funding A CARE Level II community will demonstrate success by continuing to reduce identified toxic risks and environmental pollutants and build healthier communities, even after the completion of the funded Level II project. 7


Applicants are not required to have been a recipient of a Level I agreement in order to receive a Level II agreement. However, they are designed for communities that have already established a broad-based, collaborative, problem solving partnership; that have developed an understanding of all or most of the toxic risks and environmental pollutants facing their community in multiple environmental media; and that have set community priorities for risk reduction. CARE Level II cooperative agreement funding will:  help communities identify and accomplish risk reduction actions to address the community's priority risks (as identified before the Level II project was started). Risks will be addressed through the selection and use of EPA programs and technical assistance or other voluntary actions selected by the partnership.  help the community partnership become self-sustaining. (Please note: CARE assistance may include training and assistance in how to attract new resources and partners to support further risk reduction activities, but CARE funds cannot be used to pay for filling out grant applications or other fund raising activities.) Please note: A group, no matter how broad its constituents, which was convened about a specific kind of toxin or toxic source must demonstrate that they did a detailed examination of more than that single source or class of toxics. For example, a group called "Good People Against Diesel Emissions", cannot say that they simply looked at all multi-media impacts of diesel emissions and then decided that Diesel Emissions are the top priority in the community. 10. Examples of Suggested Activities for Level I Projects:  building, convening, facilitating, and providing environmental information to community stakeholder group(s);  investigating different environmental toxic problems in the different environmental media in the community and preparing education materials for the community regarding the results of the investigations;  analyzing the toxics problems in the community and their relative risks and potential solutions;  providing information to the stakeholder group, community or the general public about any of the above activities and their results;  evaluating and tracking the progress of the project, and communicate lessons learned with their and other communities. 11. Examples of Suggested Activities for Level II Projects:  activities to reduce risks, including: identifying, choosing and implementing options for risk reduction and mobilizing local resources to carry out new or existing voluntary programs (e.g. Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools, Design for the Environment, and the Pesticide Environmental Stewardship Program, and pollution prevention of Priority 8


   

Chemicals); 
 convening, facilitating, and providing environmental information to community 
 stakeholder group(s) that may hopefully lead to toxic risk reductions; 
 finding additional partners and resources to make the project self-sustaining; 
 evaluating and tracking the progress of the project, measuring results, and 
 communicating lessons learned with their and other communities; providing information to the stakeholder group, community or the general public about any of the above activities and their results.

12. How is the CARE program different from other EPA grant programs? The CARE cooperative agreements are designed to investigate and demonstrate the long-term value of the CARE program. Specifically, EPA has developed the CARE program as a different approach to address the problems of cumulative risk in communities. While CARE builds on the efforts of previous community-based programs, CARE does offer a different approach. The CARE approach combines all of the following factors (each of which may not be unique to CARE, but the combination of approaches and tools is unique):  CARE is a multimedia program that takes a comprehensive view of toxics and environmental pollutants in a community and is not limited to a single media (air, water, land) or source.  CARE is based on providing the tools and information to communities so they can set their own priorities for risk reduction and select the voluntary programs that best fit their needs.  CARE creates a network that includes all the CARE communities. This network will allow communities to learn from and support each other.  Through a single program, CARE cooperative agreements allow communities to get organized, examine and prioritize toxic risks, and take voluntary actions to reduce those risks.  CARE uses collaborative stakeholder processes and voluntary programs to bring the various sectors of the community together to solve problems.  CARE mobilizes a network of EPA staff from across programs and regional offices to provide support, training, and tools to help communities achieve success.  CARE establishes an effective mechanism to deliver the full range of the EPA voluntary partnership programs to the communities that need and want them.  CARE helps develop community capabilities that will be self-sustaining, collaborative, and will hopefully continue improving the environmental health in the community even after the grant funding expires. 9


13. Timing of CARE funding (especially important for Level I applicants): It is the expectation of EPA that communities who receive CARE Level I cooperative agreements will successfully complete their CARE Level I project; and continue by applying and competing for a CARE Level II cooperative agreement. All Level I projects should consider the timing of the CARE funding cycle in planning their projects. Applications for CARE grants will be due in the February to March timeframe. Successful applicants will receive their money in September or October of the same year. A CARE Level I project that wants to apply for a CARE Level II cooperative agreement will have to demonstrate that they have examined the environmental risks in their community and gone through a consensus process to prioritize those risks. In other words, they must complete most of their work before applying for a Level II cooperative agreement. Level I grants provide two years of funding, the applicant can complete the project more quickly to apply for a Level II grant in 18 months or plan to ask for a 1 year no-cost extension, they then would apply for a Level II grant in 30 months after their CARE Level 1 project is awarded. In this way, the grant recipient can finalize or extend the project to match with EPA's funding cycle. Of course, the applicant can take a full two years on the project and then use other resources to keep the partnership together until they apply, compete and hopefully receive a Level II cooperative agreement. C. EPA Strategic Plan Linkage to CARE and Anticipated Outcomes/Outputs. 1. EPA's Strategic Plan ((http://www.epa.gov/ocfopage/plan/plan.htm)) has five goals: Goal 1: Clean Air and Global Climate Change Goal 2: Clean and Safe Water Goal 3: Land Preservation and Restoration Goal 4: Healthy Communities and Ecosystems Goal 5: Compliance and Environmental Stewardship Awards under the CARE program directly support progress towards EPA Strategic Plan's Goal 4: Healthy Communities and Ecosystems; Objective 4.2: Communities Sustain, Clean Up, and Restore Communities and the Ecological Systems That Support Them; and Sub-objectives: 4.2.1 (Sustain Community Health); 4.2.2 (Restore Community Health); and Objective 4.3 (Ecosystems); 4.3.1 (Protect and Restore Ecosystems). 2. The CARE program supports the other goals in EPA's Strategic Plan. In the CARE program, communities will select and carry out EPA partnership programs to reduce toxic exposures and protect the environment in their communities. While the partnership programs and other actions taken will differ from community to community, overall, the actions taken by communities through the CARE program will support a number of the other goals, objectives, and sub-objectives in the EPA Strategic Plan across all the environmental media. In addition to 10


Goal 4 they are:  Goal 1 - Clean Air and Global Climate Change: 
 Objective 1.1 (Healthier Outdoor Air) 
 Sub-Objective 1.1.2 (Reduced Risk from Toxic Air Pollutants) 
 Objective 1.2 (Healthier Indoor Air) 
 Goal 2 - Clean and Safe Water 
 Objective 2.1 (Protect Human Health) 
 Sub-objective 2.1.1 (Water Safe to Drink) 
 Objective 2.2: Protect Water Quality 
 Sub-objective 2.2.1: Improve Water Quality on a Watershed Basis 
 Goal 3 - Land Preservation and Restoration 
 Objective 3.1 (Preserve Land) 
 Sub-objective 3.1.1 (Reduce Waste Generation and Increase Recycling) 






 Goal 5 - Compliance and Environmental Stewardship Objective 5.2: Improve Environmental Performance through Pollution Prevention and Innovation, Sub-objective 5.2.1 (Prevent Pollution and Promote Environmental Stewardship 
 by Government and the Public) 
 Sub-objective 5.2.2 (Prevent Pollution and Promote Environmental Stewardship 
 by Business) 
 Sub-objective 5.2.3 (Business and Community Innovation) 
 3. Outcomes -- Through the agreements expected to be awarded under this solicitation, EPA expects to work with communities so they can:  Create self-sustaining community-based partnerships that will continue to improve local environments. (CARE Level I and II projects)  Develop a comprehensive understanding of all sources of risk from toxics and set priorities for effective action. (CARE Level I projects)  Demonstrate the reduction of risk from exposure to toxic pollutants through collaborative action at the local level. (CARE Level II projects) 4. Outputs -- The anticipated outputs for awards expected to be made under this solicitation will vary from community to community. The main expected outputs are the following:  CARE Level I project: The creation of a broad-based community stakeholder group that has developed an understanding of and has prioritized the list of the toxic risks and environmental pollutants in their community and engaged the community through a consensus process.  CARE Level II project: The community reaches consensus on the selection of partnership programs and/or other approaches to address the community's priority risks 11


(to address the risks identified in a Level I or similar project) and these programs and approaches are implemented to reduce risks in the community. While different communities will select different partnership programs, they will be expected to achieve the specific outputs/outcomes of the programs they choose. 5. Developing Performance Measures To receive a cooperative agreement under the CARE program, the applicant must develop performance measures they expect to achieve through the proposed, funded activities. The performance measures should focus on specific, quantitative actions related to the applicant's activities, outputs, and outcomes. These performance measures will help gather insights and will be the mechanism to track progress concerning successful process and outcome strategies and will provide the basis for developing lessons to inform future CARE recipients. During the two-year cooperative agreement period, every CARE grant recipient is encouraged to measure performance success in the environmental, economic, and social dimensions. While the CARE project may not lead to dramatic improvement in all three of these dimensions, the CARE applicant is encouraged to think long-term on how the environmental, economic and/or social progress of the project could be monitored long-time through data collection. Level II cooperative agreement recipients are encouraged to address actual environmental and human health improvement, whether it is through reduced impact, a more effective use of materials, control of toxics and other pollution sources, healthier ecosystem (land, air, water) functioning, or other measures. In addition, Level II cooperative agreements recipients should collect and/or use data to measure and track both short and long-term progress and success. See Appendix A for the Level I and Level II list of specific required performance measures that must be reported to EPA and examples of the kinds of measures projects could use. D. Supplementary Information. 1. National CARE Internet Seminar Web cast: The CARE program will conduct three identical national informational sessions for potential applicants via a national web cast seminar on the following dates and times: January 18, 2008 February 11, 2008 February 27, 2008 12:30 - 2:00 p.m. eastern time 1 1:00 - 12:30 p.m. eastern time 10:00 ­ 12:00 a.m. eastern time

To register for the upcoming CARE Internet Seminar for either of the above dates, please go to: http://www.cluin.org/studio/seminar.cfm and click on the registration link for the "CARE Request for Proposals Q&A". 12


After the three national Web cast sessions are completed, a recorded version of the full web cast seminar will available on: https://www.clu-in.org/live/archive. 2. EPA CARE cooperative agreements will be awarded under the following EPA research and demonstration statutory authorities:        Clean Water Act, Section 104(b)(3); 
 Solid Waste Disposal Act, Section 8001(a); 
 Clean Air Act, Section 103(b)(3); 
 Toxic Substances Control Act, Section 10(a) as supplemented by P.L. 106-74 (1999); 
 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Section 20(a) as supplemented 
 by P.L. 106-74 (1999); and, 
 Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, Section 203; 
 National Environmental Policy Act, Section 102(2)(F) 


To be selected for funding, a project must consist of activities within the statutory terms of EPA's research and demonstration grant authorities; specifically, the statutes listed above. Generally, a project must address the causes, effects, extent, prevention, reduction, and elimination of water pollution, solid/hazardous waste pollution, air pollution, toxic substances control, pesticide control, or ocean dumping. Most, but not all, of the statutes authorize financial assistance for the following activities: "research, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, and studies." These activities relate generally to the gathering or the transferring of information or advancing the state of knowledge. The application of established practices may qualify when they are part of a broader project which qualifies under the term "research." (See Section III. B., Threshold Eligibility Requirements). Applicants must be aware that there are certain statutory restrictions related to EPA's annual Appropriation Acts. Therefore, EPA funds for cooperative agreements under this solicitation cannot be used for projects within the scope of activities covered by other appropriation accounts within the EPA Appropriation Act. For example, CARE cooperative agreements cannot be used:  To equip school buses with diesel retrofit technology or to replace older school buses in order to reduce diesel emissions.  To develop and enhance state and tribal efforts to protect wetlands or to implement State and Tribal wetland programs.  For the principal purpose of providing training, research, and technical assistance to individuals and organizations to facilitate the inventory of Brownfield sites, site assessments, remediation of Brownfield sites, community involvement or site preparation. (EPA funds those types of projects with State and Tribal Assistance Grant 13


appropriations under the Office of Brownfields Cleanup and Redevelopment's "Brownfields Training, Research, and Technical Assistance Grants and Cooperative Agreement Program", Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 66.814.)  For response actions and other associated activities (including Technical Assistance Grants) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA).  To duplicate the work of the Targeted Watersheds Grant Program. The Targeted Watersheds Grant Program enhances community watershed groups' efforts through two different types of grants. Implementation grants provide monetary assistance directly to watershed organizations to implement restoration/protection activities within their watershed. Money is used to stabilize stream banks, demonstrate innovative nutrient management schemes, establish pollutant credits and trading projects, and work with local governments and private citizens to promote sustainable practices and strategies. Grants range from $300,000 to $1,300,000, with an additional 25% leveraged from other sources. Capacity building grants support established watershed service providers in their effort to increase the viability, sustainability and effectiveness of local watershed groups by providing tools, training, and education.  To survey more than 9 members of the public without prior approval by the Office of Management and Budget of the survey instrument. SECTION II--Award Information A. What is the amount of funding available? The total estimated amount of funding available under this solicitation for FY 2008 is approximately $3.5 million. Cooperative agreements resulting from this announcement will be funded incrementally, as appropriate, over a two-year period. B. How many cooperative agreements will EPA award under this solicitation? The EPA anticipates awards of between 5 and 10 Level I cooperative agreements ranging in approximate value from $75,000 to $100,000 with a maximum value of $100,000; and between 6 and 8 Level II cooperative agreements ranging in approximate value from $150,000 to $300,000, with a maximum value of $300,000. (See Section III. B., Threshold Eligibility Requirements). EPA reserves the right to reject any or all proposals and make no awards under this solicitation. EPA also reserves the right to make additional awards under this announcement consistent with Agency policy, if additional funding becomes available. Any additional selections for awards will be made no later than six months after the original selection decisions. C. What is the project period for award(s) resulting from this solicitation? 14


CARE cooperative agreements are intended to last for two years. The estimated project period for awards resulting from this solicitation is October 2008 through September 2010. D. Funding Type The funding for selected projects will be in the form of a cooperative agreement. Cooperative agreements permit substantial involvement between the EPA Project Officer and the selected applicants in the performance of the work supported. Although EPA will negotiate precise terms and conditions relating to substantial involvement as part of the award process, the anticipated substantial Federal involvement for this project may include:  close monitoring of the recipient's performance;  reviewing project progress reports;  collaborating in the performance of the scope of work;  review proposed procurements, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 31.36(g);  approving qualifications of key personnel (EPA will not select employees or contractors employed by the recipient);  reviewing and commenting on content of publications (printed or electronic) prepared under the cooperative agreement (the final decision on the content of reports rests with the recipient);  aiding the recipient and the community in understanding various networking 
 opportunities at the federal, state, and local levels. 
 SECTION III--Eligibility Information A. Eligible Entities. To be an eligible entity, an entity must fall within the statutory terms of EPA's research and demonstration grant authorities. Local, public non-profit institution/organizations, federallyrecognized Indian tribal government, Native American organizations, private non-profit institution/organization, quasi-public nonprofit institution/organization both interstate and intrastate, local government, colleges, and universities could be eligible to apply for CARE funds. A "non-profit organization", as defined by OMB Circular A-122, means any corporation, trust, association, cooperative, or other organization which: (1) is operated primarily for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purposes in the public interest; (2) is not organized primarily for profit; and (3) uses its net proceeds to maintain, improve, and/or expand its 15


operations. For this purpose, the term "non-profit organization" excludes (i) colleges and universities; (ii) hospitals; (iii) state, local, and federally-recognized Indian tribal governments; and (iv) those non-profit organizations which are excluded from coverage of this Circular in accordance with paragraph 5 of the Circular. Non-profit organizations described in Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code that engage in lobbying activities as defined in Section 3 of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 are not eligible to apply. State governments or their agencies are not eligible to apply. EPA hopes the CARE partnerships will work with State agencies as partners to support CARE projects and communities, where appropriate. B. Threshold Eligibility Requirements. These are requirements which if not met by the time of proposal submission will result in elimination of the proposal from consideration for funding. Only proposals that meet all of these criteria will be evaluated against the ranking factors in Section V of this solicitation. Applicants deemed ineligible for funding consideration as a result of the threshold eligibility review will be notified within 15 calendar days of the ineligibility determination. 1. Proposed projects must consist of activities within the statutory terms of EPA's research and demonstration grant authorities, as explained in Section I.D., Supplementary Information. 2. Proposals received for Level I projects in excess of the maximum value of $100,000 will not be considered. 3. Proposals received for Level II projects in excess of the maximum value of $300,000 will not be considered. 4. Applicants must apply for either a Level I or Level II agreement, not both, and they must state their Level I or Level II selection clearly in their proposal. An applicant that has already received a Level I Grant cannot apply for a second Level I grant and an applicant that has already received a Level II Grant cannot apply for a second Level II grant. 5. Only one proposal may be submitted per applicant organization. However, an applicant organization can be a partner for more than one CARE project proposal. 6. The proposal must be for a project in a community that meets the CARE definition in Section I. B.4., Definition of a CARE Community, and must be located in the United States or its territories. 7. Project proposals must be written in English. The minimum acceptable font size for the narrative proposal and the budget is 12 point; material in smaller font sizes will not be considered. Pages must have at least 1 inch margins on all sides. 16


8. Hard copy proposals will only be accepted by an express delivery service. EPA will not accept proposals sent by U.S. Postal Service. EPA will not accept proposals submitted via FAX or email. 9. a. Proposals must substantially comply with the proposal submission instructions and requirements set forth in Section IV of this announcement or else they will be rejected. However, where a page limit is expressed in Section IV with respect to the proposal, pages in excess of the page limitation will not be reviewed. b. In addition, proposals must be received by the EPA or received through www.grants.gov, as specified in Section IV of this announcement, on or before the proposal submission deadline published in Section IV of this announcement. Applicants are responsible for ensuring that their proposal reaches the designated person/office specified in Section IV of the announcement by the submission deadline. c. Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered late and returned to the sender without further consideration unless the applicant can clearly demonstrate that it was late due to EPA mishandling. For hard copy submissions, where Section IV requires proposal receipt by a specific person/office by the submission deadline, receipt by an agency mailroom is not sufficient. Applicants should confirm receipt of their proposal with Dennis O'Connor (oconnor.dennis@epa.gov) as soon as possible after the submission deadline--failure to do so may result in your proposal not being reviewed. 10. Threshold Factor for Level II Proposals Only: There must be an established broad-based stakeholder group (as described in Section I.B.5) that has developed an understanding of all or most of the toxic risks in the community and established priorities for risk reduction. To be eligible for a Level II cooperative agreement, the applicant:  must be leading or representing an existing collaborative partnership that represents the various constituencies in the community: citizens, businesses, and local government (additional appropriate partners can also be part of the partnership). A majority of the stakeholders in the partnership that did the prioritization must be part of the collaborative partnership that will be used for the Level II process. Specific commitments from the individual partners should be included in the proposal package. EPA expects that most of the community members or organizations that were part of the original work will continue to be part of the Level II partnership.  must be part or represent a stakeholder group that have completed a detailed examination of all or most of the toxic risks in the community including all environmental media (air, water, etc.). While EPA recognizes that it is possible for a community to look at a widerange of environmental risks and media, and come to consensus that they will work in only one environmental media, we believe it to be unlikely. Therefore, the proposal must include very clear evidence to demonstrate how the community-based partnership examined risks from a number of sources in a number of environmental media; and why 17


the Level II grant proposes: a single project, or all or the vast majority of the work in one single medium.  must be part or represent a stakeholder group that has come to consensus on the specific community priorities for risk reduction. It is not acceptable to have a process in which several different, unrelated groups did separate analyses of different risks and then the applicant takes the results from the separate groups and simply puts them together. Somewhere in the process there must be a single broad-based stakeholder group that will examine the risks across media and come to community-based consensus on the priority risks.  must be prepared to choose a risk reduction activity to address to address the identified community priorities. PLEASE NOTE: A collaborative stakeholder group, no matter how broad its constituents, which was convened about a specific kind of toxic or environmental pollutant source or environmental media must demonstrate that they did a detailed examination of more than that single source or class of toxics. For example, a group called "Good People Against Diesel Emissions", cannot state that they looked at all multi-media impacts of diesel emissions and then decided that diesel emissions were the top priority in the community. EPA does not consider this to be a "detailed examination of all or most of the toxic risks in the community including all environmental media." C. Are matching funds required? A specific level of cost sharing or matching funds is not required as a condition of eligibility, or otherwise, for project proposals to be selected for award. If matched dollars/in-kind work are included in a Level I proposal, they will not be used as additional weight in the Level I projects evaluation. However, the ability to leverage additional resources, technical or financial, from other applicants or partners will be evaluated for Level II projects (See Section V.A, Evaluation Criteria). SECTION IV--Proposal and Submission Information A. How to Obtain Proposal Package EPA encourages applicants to obtain proposal materials and apply electronically through http://www.grants.gov. Applicants may also download individual grant application forms, or electronically request a paper application package and an accompanying computer CD of information related to applicant/grants recipients roles and responsibilities from EPA's Grants and Debarment Web site at: (http://www.epa.gov/ogd/grants/how_to_apply.htm).

In accordance with 40 CFR 2.203, applicants may claim all or a portion of their application/proposal as confidential business information. EPA will evaluate confidentiality claims in accordance with 40 CFR Part 2. Applicants must clearly mark applications/proposals or portions of applications/proposals they claim as confidential. If no claim of confidentiality is made, EPA is not required to make the inquiry to the applicant otherwise required by 40 CFR 2.204(c)(2) prior to disclosure. G. Pre-proposal/Application Assistance and Communications. In accordance with EPA's Assistance Agreement Competition Policy (EPA Order 5700.5A1), EPA staff will not meet with individual applicants to discuss draft proposals, provide informal comments on draft proposals, or provide advice to applicants on how to respond to ranking criteria. Applicants are responsible for the contents of their applications/proposals. However, consistent with the provisions in the announcement, EPA will respond to questions from individual applicants regarding threshold eligibility criteria, administrative issues related to the submission of the proposal, and requests for clarification about the announcement. H. Management Fees Management Fees: When formulating budgets for proposals/applications, applicants must not include management fees or similar charges in excess of the direct costs and indirect costs at the rate approved by the applicants cognizant audit agency, or at the rate provided for by the terms 24


of the agreement negotiated with EPA. The term "management fees or similar charges" refers to expenses added to the direct costs in order to accumulate and reserve funds for ongoing business expenses, unforeseen liabilities, or for other similar costs that are not allowable under EPA assistance agreements. Management fees or similar charges may not be used to improve or expand the project funded under this agreement, except to the extent authorized as a direct cost of carrying out the scope of work. I. Data Universal Number System (DUNS) Number 
 All applicants are required to provide a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering 
 System (DUNS) number when applying for a federal grant or cooperative agreement. 
 Applicants can receive a DUNS number, at no cost, by calling the dedicated toll-free DUNS 
 Number request line at 1-866-705-5711, or by visiting the D&B web-site at: 
 http://www.dnb.com. 
 J. Past Performance Programmatic Capability i. Programmatic Capability: Submit a list of federally funded assistance agreements (assistance agreements include Federal grants and cooperative agreements but not Federal contracts) similar in size, scope and relevance to the proposed project that your organization performed within the last three years (no more than 5, and preferably EPA agreements) and describe (i) whether, and how, you were able to successfully complete and manage those agreements and (ii) your history of meeting the reporting requirements under those agreements including submitting acceptable final technical reports. *In evaluating applicants under these factors in Section V, EPA will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant information from other sources, including information from EPA files and from current and prior Federal agency grantors (e.g., to verify and/or supplement the information provided by the applicant). If you do not have any relevant or available past performance or reporting information, please indicate this in the proposal and you will receive a neutral score for these factors under Section V. ii. Reporting on Environmental Results--Outcomes and Outputs: Submit a list of federally funded assistance agreements (assistance agreements include Federal grants and cooperative agreements but not Federal contracts) that your organization performed within the last three years ( no more than 5, and preferably EPA agreements), and describe how you documented and/or reported on whether you were making progress towards achieving the expected results (e.g., outputs and outcomes) under those agreements. If you were not making progress, please indicate whether, and how, you documented why not. *In evaluating applicants under this factor in Section V, EPA will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant information from other sources, including information from EPA files and from current and prior Federal agency grantors (e.g., to verify and/or supplement the information provided by the applicant). If you do not 25


have any relevant or available environmental results past performance information, please indicate this in the proposal and you will receive a neutral score for this factor under Section V. K. Partnerships, Contractors and Subawards i. Can funding be used for the applicant to make subawards, acquire contract services, or fund partnership? EPA awards funds to one eligible applicant as the recipient even if other eligible applicants are named as partners or co-applicants or members of a coalition or consortium. The recipient is accountable to EPA for the proper expenditure of funds. Funding may be used to provide subgrants or subawards of financial assistance, which includes using subawards or subgrants to fund partnerships, provided the recipient complies with applicable requirements for subawards or subgrants including those contained in 40 CFR Parts 30 or 31, as appropriate. Applicants must compete contracts for services and products, including consultant contracts, and conduct cost and price analyses to the extent required by the procurement provisions of the regulations at 40 CFR Parts 30 or 31, as appropriate. The regulations also contain limitations on consultant compensation. Applicants are not required to identify subawardees/subgrantees and/or contractors (including consultants) in their proposal/application. However, if they do, the fact that an applicant selected for award has named a specific subawardee/subgrantee, contractor, or consultant in the proposal/application EPA selects for funding does not relieve the applicant of its obligations to comply with subaward/subgrant and/or competitive procurement requirements as appropriate. Please note that applicants may not award sole source contracts to consulting, engineering or other firms assisting applicants with the proposal solely based on the firm's role in preparing the proposal/application. Successful applicants cannot use subgrants or subawards to avoid requirements in EPA grant regulations for competitive procurement by using these instruments to acquire commercial services or products from for-profit organizations to carry out its assistance agreement. The nature of the transaction between the recipient and the subawardee or subgrantee must be consistent with the standards for distinguishing between vendor transactions and subrecipient assistance under Subpart B Section .210 of OMB Circular A-133 , and the definitions of subaward at 40 CFR 30.2(ff) or subgrant at 40 CFR 31.3, as applicable. EPA will not be a party to these transactions. Applicants acquiring commercial goods or services must comply with the competitive procurement standards in 40 CFR Part 30 or 40 CFR Part 31.36 and cannot use a subaward/subgrant as the funding mechanism. ii. How will an applicant's proposed subawardees/subgrantees and contractors be considered during the evaluation process described in Section V of the announcement? 26


Section V of the announcement describes the evaluation criteria and evaluation process that will be used by EPA to make selections under this announcement. During this evaluation, except for those criteria that relate to the applicant's own qualifications, past performance, and reporting history, the review panel will consider, if appropriate and relevant, the qualifications, expertise, and experience of: (i) an applicant's named subawardees/subgrantees identified in the proposal/application if the applicant demonstrates in the proposal/application that if it receives an award that the subaward/subgrant will be properly awarded consistent with the applicable regulations in 40 CFR Parts 30 or 31. For example, applicants must not use subawards/subgrants to obtain commercial services or products from for profit firms or individual consultants. (ii) an applicant's named contractor(s), including consultants, identified in the proposal/application if the applicant demonstrates in its proposal/application that the contractor(s) was selected in compliance with the competitive Procurement Standards in 40 CFR Part 30 or 40 CFR 31.36 as appropriate. For example, an applicant must demonstrate that it selected the contractor(s) competitively or that a proper noncompetitive sole-source award consistent with the regulations will be made to the contractor(s), that efforts were made to provide small and disadvantaged businesses with opportunities to compete, and that some form of cost or price analysis was conducted. EPA may not accept sole source justifications for contracts for services or products that are otherwise readily available in the commercial marketplace. EPA will not consider the qualifications, experience, and expertise of named subawardees/subgrantees and/or named contractor(s) during the proposal/application evaluation process unless the applicant complies with these requirements. L. Final Application Packages Following EPA's evaluation of proposals/applications, all applicants will be notified regarding their status. Only the applicants whose proposals are tentatively selected will be required to submit a final cooperative agreement application package to their EPA Regional office. Final applications will be requested from those eligible entities whose proposal has been successfully evaluated and preliminarily recommended for award. Those entities will be provided with instructions and a due date for submittal of the final application package. Applicants will also be required to submit quarterly and final progress reports in accordance with grants regulations found in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 30.51 or 40 CFR 31.40. SECTION V--Proposal Review Information A. Evaluation Criteria. Each applicant's proposal that meets the threshold criteria in Section III will be evaluated 27


according to the criteria set forth below. EPA strongly suggests that you refer to the guidance in Appendix C when writing your proposal. Applicants must clearly and explicitly address these criteria as part of their proposal submittal and must state whether they are applying for a Level I or Level II agreement. Each proposal will be rated under the specific Levels' point system, with a total of 100 points possible. LEVEL I PROPOSAL EVALUTION CRITERIA For the award of Level I cooperative agreements, the proposals will be evaluated on the following criteria: Maximum Points per criterion 15

Level I Evaluation Criteria 1. Extent of environment and public health problems: Proposals will be evaluated based on the extent the community is:  impacted by toxic pollution by various environmental media (air, water, land, indoor environments, etc.), including significant community exposures to toxics and environmental pollutants from multiple sources and/or multiple stresses to the local environment, and/or, impacted by multiple stresses on economically disadvantaged communities and/or vulnerable communities and populations.



Note: Proposals that describe multiple environmental concerns, instead of a single environmental threat, may be given more weight in the evaluation process. 2. Project Goals and Performance Plan: The proposal will be evaluated on the extent and detail to which the project presents a comprehensive, well thought-out performance plan with activities, milestones, and timelines to achieve the identified goals of the CARE project including coming to consensus on priority risks, while remaining in line with the project budget, and how the project will assist the partnership to be ready to apply in the future for a CARE Level II cooperative agreement. 25

28


3. Community Involvement/Collaboration/Partnerships: The proposals will be evaluated based on the applicant organizational capacity and its ability to organize and run an effective collaborative partnership (e.g., citizens, businesses, governments, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations) and any other appropriate partners. The partnership must include all parties necessary to identify sources of toxics and environmental pollutants, set priorities, and bring about solutions. Any gaps in membership representation (e.g., community organizations, personnel or citizens not now participating), and how those gaps will be addressed, should be described. Proposals with detailed letters of specific commitment (explaining how the committed entity will act in partnership with the applicant) from partnership members will be scored higher than proposals which do not have them, or only include letters of general support. Proposals with letters of commitment from multiple stakeholders representing different types of interests will be scored higher than those with only a few stakeholders or with only a few types of interests represented. 4. Alignment with CARE Strategies: In the "Scope of CARE Projects" section (I.B.2) of this solicitation, the CARE program has identified six strategies to achieve its goals. Proposals will be evaluated based on the extent and quality to which they demonstrate how they will address the following three CARE strategies:  Provide information, and a variety of tools, and technical assistance to help communities understand and assess all potential potential sources of exposure to toxic pollutants. Focus on action and mobilize local resources and utilize EPA voluntary programs to carry out risk reduction activities. Build effective, long-term, collaborative partnerships that include community organizations and residents, businesses, and governments and other appropriate partners.

25

15

 

Each strategy is worth five points. 5. Tracking and Measuring Environmental Results: The proposal will be evaluated on the effectiveness of the proposed plan for tracking and measuring of the expected environmental results, particularly documenting progress toward finalizing project activities and achieving the expected project outputs and outcomes; including those identified in Section I.C and Appendix A of the solicitation. The applicants should clearly specify the performance measures they will be tracking. The performance measures should focus on solid, quantitative measures related to the project activities, outputs, and outcomes. 10

29


6. Programmatic Capability/Reporting Environmental Results: Proposals will be evaluated based on the degree and detail to which they describe and demonstrate the applicant's ability to successfully complete and manage the proposed project, taking into account the following factors:  its past performance in successfully completing and managing federally-funded assistance agreements similar in size, scope, and relevance to the proposed project performed within the last three years (no more than five projects, and preferably EPA projects); its history of meeting reporting requirements under federally-funded assistance agreements similar in size, scope, and relevance to the proposed project performed within the last three years and submitting acceptable final technical reports under those agreements; its organizational experience and plan for timely and successfully achieving the objectives of the proposed project; its staff expertise/qualifications, staff knowledge, and resources or the ability to obtain them, to successfully achieve the goals of the proposed project; and the extent and quality to which they adequately documented and/or reported on their progress towards achieving the expected results (e.g., outcomes and outputs) under Federal agency assistance agreements performed within the last three years, and if such progress was not being made whether the applicant adequately documented and/or reported why not.

10



  

Note: In evaluating proposals under this factor, EPA will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant information from other sources including Agency files and prior/current grantors (e.g., to verify and/or supplement the information supplied by the applicant). Applicants with no relevant or available past performance reporting history in the first, second, and last bullets will receive a neutral score (5 pts) for these factors. Each item is worth 2 points. LEVEL II PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA For the award of Level II cooperative agreements, proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria: Maximum Points per criterion

Evaluation Criteria 30


1. Environmental issues and concerns: Proposals will be evaluated based on the extent and detail they demonstrate the community is:  impacted by toxic pollution by various environmental media (air, water, land, indoor environments, etc.), including significant community exposures to toxics and environmental pollutants from multiple sources and/or multiple stresses to the local environment, and/or,  impacted by multiple stresses on economically disadvantaged communities and/or vulnerable communities and populations. Applicants should note the following:  Additional points will be given to proposals that are able to factually detail their unique multi-media concerns and how those concerns were identified and prioritized by a community-based consensus.  Information that is specific to the community served by the project will be given more weight than general information.  Proposals that clearly describe the process by which the set of multiple environmental concerns went through the prioritization process may be given more weight in the evaluation process. 2. Project Goals and Performance Plan: The proposal will be evaluated on the extent to which ˇ the project presents a detailed, comprehensive, well thought-out performance plan with activities, milestones, and timelines to achieve the identified goals of the CARE project while remaining in line with the project budget, and how the project assists to continue a sustainable partnership to continue addressing the community environmental concerns. ˇ the goals of the project are based on and consistent with the risk prioritization process identified through the collaborative stakeholder process (Level I activities).

3 Past and Continued Success of Broad-Based Stakeholder Group: Under this criterion, proposals will be evaluated based on the current and expected future inclusiveness, effectiveness, and overall success of the existing collaborative partnership and broad-based stakeholder group and the processes it used to acquire Level I information and build community-based consensus up to this point.  Inclusiveness looks at how broad based the partnership is and whether the participants represent the various interests in the community and how it made consensus decisions.  Effectiveness looks at the multi-media nature and depth of the examination of toxics and environmental pollutants in the community and how the current group (or a new version of the group) will ensure progress and productive performance.  Success looks at the group's ability to build consensus on choosing their priority risks and developing a sustainable partnership.

20

The proposal should also explain why the applicant is the appropriate recipient of the CARE funds for the partnership. Proposals with detailed letters of specific commitment from the partnership members (explaining how the committed entity will act in partnership with the applicant) will be scored higher than applications which only general letters of support or those proposals that are applicant-sponsored only. Proposals with letters of commitment from multiple stakeholders representing different types of interests will be scored higher than those with only a few stakeholders or with only a few types of interests represented. 4. Ability to Leverage New Resources and Sustain Community Efforts to Understand and Improve the Environment: Proposals will be evaluated based on the demonstrated extent and detail to which the applicant can demonstrate its ability to use the work and results of the CARE project and the broad-based stakeholder partnership to leverage other resources including technical assistance and volunteer resources to expand and sustain their efforts to understand and improve the local environment and continue addressing the community's prioritized concerns. 5. Alignment with CARE Strategies: In the "Scope of CARE Projects" section (I.B.2) of this solicitation, the CARE program has identified six strategies to achieve its goals. Proposals will be evaluated based on the extent and quality to which they demonstrate how the work proposed for Level II cooperative agreements will address the following two CARE strategies:  Focus on action and mobilize local resources and utilize voluntary programs to carry out risk reduction activities; 32
 15

10

 

Build effective collaborative partnerships that include community organizations and residents, businesses, and governments and other appropriate partners. Build long-term community capacity to continue improving the local environment.

Each strategy is worth 5 points. 6. Tracking and Measuring Environmental Results: The proposal will be evaluated on the extent and detail of a comprehensive proposed plan for an effective tracking and measuring of the expected environmental results, particularly documenting progress toward finalizing project's activities and achieving the expected project outputs and outcomes; including those identified in Section I.C and Appendix A of the solicitation. The applicants should clearly specify the performance measures they will be tracking. The performance measures should focus on solid, quantitative measures related to the project's activities, outputs, and outcomes. 10

7. Programmatic Capability/Reporting Environmental Results: Under this criterion, applicants will be evaluated based on their ability to successfully complete and manage the proposed project and to the extent and quality to which they adequately documented and/or reported on their progress towards achieving the expected results (e.g., outcomes and outputs) taking into account the applicant's: (i) past performance in successfully completing and managing federally funded assistance agreements (assistance agreements include Federal grants and cooperative agreements but not Federal contracts) similar in size, scope, and relevance to the proposed project performed within the last 3 years, (ii) history of meeting reporting requirements under federally funded assistance agreements (assistance agreements include Federal grants and cooperative agreements but not Federal contracts) similar in size, scope, and relevance to the proposed project performed within the last 3 years and submitting acceptable final technical reports under those agreements, (iii) organizational experience and plan for timely and successfully achieving the objectives of the proposed project, (iv) staff expertise/qualifications, staff knowledge, and resources or the ability to obtain them, to successfully achieve the goals of the proposed project., and (v) the achievement, documentation and reporting of their environmental progress and if such progress was not being made whether the applicant adequately documented and/or reported 33


10

why not. Note: In evaluating applicants under this criterion, the Agency will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant information from other sources including agency files and prior/current grantors (e.g., to verify and/or supplement the information supplied by the applicant). Applicants with no relevant or available past performance or reporting history (items i and ii above), will receive a neutral score (5 pts) for those elements of this criterion. Note: In evaluating proposals under this factor, EPA will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant information from other sources including Agency files and prior/current grantors (e.g., to verify and/or supplement the information supplied by the applicant). Applicants with no relevant or available past performance reporting history in the first, second, and last bullets will receive a neutral score (1 pt for each bullet) for these factors. Each item is worth 2 points.

34


B. Review and Selection Process. Eligibility Determination and EPA Regional Review and Ranking Step 1: All Level I and II proposals will first be evaluated by EPA Headquarters staff to see if they meet the threshold criteria identified in Section III. Those that do not meet the threshold criteria will be considered ineligible and will not be scored or considered further. Step 2: An Evaluation Team in each EPA regional office will then evaluate the eligible proposals from the states covered by their region based on the ranking criteria described in Section V.A. The appropriate regional office will be determined by the location of the community served by the project and not by the location of the applicant. Step 3: After the evaluation is complete, the regional offices that reviewed proposals will forward to the National Selection Committee (described below) the two (2) highest ranked Level I and Level II proposals, or any combination of their four highest ranked proposals (e.g., three Level I and one Level II). Regions can forward up to four (4) proposals to the National Selection Committee, although they can send less than four (4) depending on the quality of proposals received and reviewed. EPA National Selection Committee Determination Step 4: As described above, the highest ranked proposals, based on the evaluation of the proposals against the Section V.A. criteria, from EPA regional offices will be referred to the National Selection Committee for further evaluation. The National Selection Committee will consist of staff from a cross section of EPA programs and regional offices. The National Selection Committee will consider and review the highest ranking proposals received from the regions against the following other factors:  An appropriate balance of Level I and Level II projects;  Geographic balance of projects within each EPA region and throughout the nation geographic diversity of all of the CARE funded projects collectively is preferable, so two projects in the same city or county are unlikely (see the listing of past funded CARE projects at www.epa.gov/care.)  The diverse environmental nature of the projects (different major environmental concerns addressed);  Type of community (rural, urban, low-income, minority, vulnerable population, etc.);  Type of grantee (tribe, community group, local government agency, university);  The extent to which the projected use of funds will be spent to directly benefit the 
 community. 
 35


 Projects whose environment and/or public health benefits can be sustained after the cooperative agreement is completed: and  Projects that are consistent with the priorities established in the Regional Strategic Plans. EPA Regional Strategic Plans can be found at: www.epa.gov/ocfo/regionplans/regionalplans2.htm Step 5: Final proposal selection recommendations will be made by the National Selection Committee to the Selecting Official from among the highest ranked proposals and based on consideration of the other factors identified in Step 4 above. Step 6: Final applications for cooperative agreement funding will be requested only from those eligible entities whose initial proposals have been tentatively selected for funding. EPA will notify selected applicants on or before October 1, 2008. Step 7: The regional grants office will review the final application for cooperative agreement funding and will work with the regional project officer to finalize a project work plan. Once the final application and work plan are approved, the regional grants office will notify the applicant that it has been formally approved for selection and funding. Section VI--Award Administration Information A.  Award Notices Following final selections, all applicants will be notified regarding their application's status. EPA anticipates notification to successful applicant(s) will be made via telephone, electronic or postal mail by October 1, 2008 by the corresponding EPA regional grants offices. This notification, which advises that the applicant's proposal has been selected and is being recommended for award, is not an authorization to begin performance. The award notice signed by the EPA grants officer is the authorizing document and will be provided through postal mail, and issues after the cooperative agreement is negotiated. At a minimum, this process can take up to 90 days from the date of selection. EPA anticipates notification to unsuccessful applicant(s) will be made by the corresponding EPA regional office via electronic or postal mail by October 1, 2008. In either event, the notification will be sent to the original signer of the application. B.  Administrative and National Policy Requirements A listing and description of general EPA Regulations applicable to the award of federal assistance agreements may be viewed at: http://www.epa.gov/ogd/AppKit/applicable_epa_regulations_and_description.htm. 36


This program may be eligible for coverage under Executive Order 12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs." An applicant should consult the office or official designated as the single point of contact in the state where the proposed project will be conducted for more information on the process the state requires to be followed in applying for assistance, if the state has selected the program for review (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/spoc.html). This review is not required with the initial proposal and not all states require such a review. Grants and agreements with institutions of higher education are subject to 40 CFR Parts 30 and 40 and OMB circular A-122 for non-profits and A-21 for institutions of higher learning. Programmatic terms and conditions in the cooperative agreements will be negotiated between EPA and the selected recipient. C. Non-profit Administrative Capability Non-profit applicants that are recommended for funding under this solicitation are subject to preaward administrative capability reviews consistent with Section 8b, 8c and 9d of EPA Order 5700.8 - Policy on Assessing Capabilities of Non-Profit Applicants for Managing Assistance Awards (http://www.epa.gov/ogd/grants/award/5700_8.pdf). In addition, non-profit applicants that qualify for funding may, depending on the size of the award, be required to fill out and submit to the Grants Management Office the Administrative Capabilities Form with supporting documents contained in Appendix A of EPA Order 5700.8. D. Reporting Requirement Quarterly progress reports and a detailed final report will be required. These quarterly reports will be required to be written and sent electronically to the official EPA regional Project Officer. They will summarize the technical progress, planned activities for next quarter, and give a summary of expenditures. These quarterly reports should also include: a summary of performance progress-to-date, detailed expenditures-to-date, problems encountered, successes achieved, and lessons learned. The final report shall be completed within 90 calendar days of the completion of the period of performance. The schedule for submission of quarterly reports and any additional specific information required in the reports will be established, by EPA, after award. While the Agency will negotiate precise terms and conditions relating to substantial involvement as part of the award process, EPA expects to closely monitor:    the successful applicant(s) performance; collaborate during the performance of the scope of work; approve the substantive terms of proposed grants; 37


  

approve the qualifications of key personnel; review and comment on reports prepared under the resulting cooperative agreement; and evaluate the engineering improvements on an EPA demonstration project.

After award and during administration of the resulting cooperative agreements, the EPA Project Officer(s) expects to hold monthly telephone conference calls with all successful award recipients. A template will be furnished on those items to be discussed. As part of EPA's efforts to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the CARE program, EPA or its contractors or future grantees may attempt to follow up with community stakeholders groups involved in the CARE program from time to time to ask a series of questions from the applicant regarding the accomplishments of the community after the end of the cooperative agreement. Such questions would be of a general nature such as to additional funding received and programs accomplished. EPA expects that the cooperative agreement recipients will be willing to provide such information when requested. E. Disputes Assistance agreement competition-related disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures published in 70 FR (Federal Register) 3629, 3630 (January 26, 2005) which can be found at http://www.epa.gov/ogd/competition/resolution.htm.

Appendix A 
 CARE Required Performance Measures 


Why measure performance? Measuring project progress is critical to achieving your desired goals. Targeting work toward specific project outcomes can help you manage your project to achieve these results. Measurement can tell you what is working with your project and what is not, and when it may be necessary to adapt your approach. It will give you the information to know that your efforts are having a positive impact on your community. It will help you remain sustainable, by giving you the information to demonstrate to EPA and other supporting organizations that you are achieving your project goals. CARE Performance Measurement Requirements To ensure the long-term viability of individual CARE projects it is critical that the program as a whole demonstrate strong results. As a part of each cooperative agreement, CARE requires grantees to provide performance information through quarterly progress reports and a final report. This information will help the CARE Team track the successes of the program and manage the program effectively. "Output" and "Outcome" measures Under EPA Order EPA Order 5700.7 "Environmental Results Under Assistance" (http://www.epa.gov/ogd/grants/award/5700.7.pdf), EPA requires that all of its grants and cooperative agreement programs ensure that grantee work plans contain not only well-defined outputs, but also, to the maximum extent practicable, well-defined outcomes. The term "outcome" means the result that will occur from carrying out an activity that is related to a project goal. Outcomes may be environmental, behavioral, health-related, or programmatic in nature, must be quantitative, and may not necessarily be achievable within an assistance agreement funding period. The term "output" means an environmental activity, effort, and/or associated work products related to an environmental goal or objective, that will be produced or provided over a period of time or by a specified date. Outputs may be quantitative or qualitative but must be measurable during an assistance agreement funding period. Outputs reflect the products and services provided by the recipient, but do not, by themselves, measure the programmatic or environmental results of an assistance agreement. There are two major types of outcomes - end outcomes and intermediate outcomes. End outcomes are the desired end or ultimate results of a project or program. They represent results that lead to environmental/public health improvement. A change in water quality and resultant change in human health or environmental impacts are examples of end outcomes. 40


Intermediate outcomes are outcomes that are expected to lead to end outcomes but are not themselves "ends." Given that the end outcomes of an assistance agreement may not occur until after the assistance agreement funding period, intermediate outcomes realized during the funding period are an important way to measure progress in achieving end outcomes. For example, for an air pollution program, reductions in pollution emissions may be viewed as an intermediate outcome to measure progress toward meeting or contributing to end outcomes of improved ambient air quality and reduced mortality from air pollution. The following examples illustrate the relationship between outputs and outcomes. 1. If a project goal is to meet regularly with partners to plan for and conduct business or other outreach activities to involve others in pollution prevention activities, you may wish to measure: Outputs: The frequency of these meetings, whether an outreach plan is developed. Outcomes: The percentage of targeted businesses involved in pollution prevention programs or efforts--before and after outreach, the results of the pollution prevention activities' contact (e.g., financial, technical, or in kind assistance). 2. If a project goal is to reduce idling at schools through an anti-idling campaign, you may wish to measure: Outputs: The number of schools that are a part of the campaign, the percentage of the target population reached with the anti-idling messages. Outcomes: Reductions in air toxic emissions at schools from buses and cars and based on the calculations of pre and post idling campaign estimates. Developing Performance Measures for your Proposed Work Plan The following are questions to consider when developing output and outcome measures of quantitative and qualitative results. 1) What are the measurable short term and longer term results the project will achieve? 2) How does the plan measure progress in achieving the expected results (including outputs and outcomes) and how will the approach use resources effectively and efficiently? One tool that may be useful to you in developing output and outcome measures is a "logic model." A logic model is a visual model that shows the relationship between your work and your desired results. It communicates the performance story of your project, focusing attention on the most important connections between your actions and the results. A logic model can serve as a basic road map for the project, explaining where you are and where you hope to end up. The following Web Sites provide information on how to develop a logic model and how to use a logic model as a tool to develop your project measures. 41


The Kellogg Foundation guide to developing logic models: www.wkkf.org/Pubs/Tools/Evaluation/Pub3669.pdf An EPA Region 10 Web Page with measurement information and tools: http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/ECOCOMM.NSF/webpage/measuring+environmental+results A University of Wisconsin Extension Service online course on enhancing performance using logic models: http://www.uwex.edu/ces/lmcourse/ A page with National Fish and Wildlife Foundation logic framework examples: http://www.nfwf.org/evaluation/logicframework.cfm Data collection There are various methods for collecting or tracking data. Those selected will depend on the specifics of the project. Example 1: To measure the effectiveness of an educational training workshop, the applicant may want to administer a pre and post tests to those who attended. Example 2: The pre and post tests may be appropriate for this element of the project, while another element of the project may want to document pre and post project behavioral changes by community members. For your measures, think about what your data source will be (e.g., people, existing records, observation) and how you will collect the data (e.g., observing behavior changes, administering pre and post tests). Note that measures of environmental or human health benefits resulting from the project may be estimated or projected. CARE Program Measures The EPA CARE team has developed a set of measures to track the progress and results of all CARE projects. To develop this set of measures, EPA used a "logic model" approach. Using this approach, the EPA CARE tracking team first mapped out the relationships between the program's key activities and intended results, and then used this model to identify feasible and informative measures of progress. This information will be gathered primarily from grantee quarterly progress reports and final reports. EPA will use these measures to track and communicate program results. The information that EPA is tracking for all of its CARE grantees is:

42


Level I Measures: ˇ Whether you form or focus a broad, results-oriented, collaborative, multi-stakeholder partnership to address toxics and environmental pollutants within 18 months of beginning work; ˇ How many and which toxic awareness raising and analytical risk screening and 
 assessment tools did the stakeholder group use; 
 ˇ Whether the stakeholder group obtained consensus on a list of priority toxic concerns; ˇ The amount of reductions of toxics and environmental pollutants and associated benefits achieved, if any; ˇ Whether you choose to apply for a CARE Level II cooperative agreement grant; ˇ The number and type of other organizations with whom you are partnering; and ˇ The resource contributions (dollar and other) the partnership has obtained from other organizations. Level II Measures ˇ Whether the stakeholder group reaches consensus and produces a set of priority actions based on their priority toxics concerns within nine months of beginning work; ˇ Which voluntary programs you implement; ˇ The amount of toxics and environmental pollutants reductions and associated benefits achieved; ˇ Whether you are reaching your priority action targets; ˇ Whether you are meeting your milestones to achieve sustainability, as outlined in your work plan; ˇ The number and type of other organizations with whom you are partnering; ˇ The resource contributions (dollar and other) the partnership has obtained from other organizations; ˇ The amount of money the partnership raises after CARE grant funding ends; and ˇ Whether the partnership continues to exist after CARE grant funding ends.

Appendix C 45


Suggestions for the Type of Information To Include in Your Narrative Proposal Section V.A contains the evaluation criteria. EPA is providing Appendix C to give the applicant a description of the types of material we are looking for in your narrative. The same numbering system is being applied that is used in the Evaluation Criteria to make it easier to follow. The following list is applicable to Level I Projects only 1. Extent of environment and public health problems: Level I projects should be designed to help communities assess and prioritize risks, so communities are not expected to present a detailed analysis of community risks and impacts. Available information and community knowledge can be used to present a preliminary picture of community risk and impacts.  Describe the environmental problems that cause the applicant to seek a Level I CARE cooperative agreement.  Using available information, describe the nature of pollution in your community and identify any health and/or environmental impacts that may be related to toxics. 2. Project Goals and Performance Plan: The Agency encourages applicants to use a one-page Logic Model to detail the project's plan. (See Appendix A for information on resources to help you develop a Logic Model)  Specifically identify measurable project goals, outcomes and outputs;  Describe how the project work planned will directly address the community's needs.  Enumerate in the proposal tasks, and milestones (i.e. dates by which tasks will be carried out and outputs will be produced.)  Identify what persons or organizations will have lead responsibility for tasks and 
 milestones. 
  The budget narrative should show support and alignment with the project goals and performance plan.  The plan needs to explain the timeline the applicant will use to be ready to apply for a CARE Level II cooperative agreement. The explanation should clearly state whether they will be ready to apply for a CARE Level II in 18 or 30 months and how they will keep the partnership together until they receive additional funding.  A Level I applicant should, to the extent possible, include a description of your plan to identify risks by identifying possible data sources and potential ways of gathering information about possible risks, the ways those risks will be communicated to the stakeholders in the community, and to the extent possible, applicants should also discuss some options that you may employ to rank and prioritize those risks once identified. There are no required sets of data or required risk ranking tools and therefore applicants are encouraged to be as descriptive as possible as to their scope of work. 46

 The scope of the CARE work project need only reflect the federally funded work. 3. Community involvement/collaboration/partnerships:  Describe what you will do to bring the community together for the purpose of collaboratively, identifying, and reducing exposure to toxics in the community.  Be clear about how you will identify and prioritize risks.  The narrative should explicitly describe what groups (i.e. community, business government and others as appropriate) the applicant will work with. The point of this is to allow us to evaluate your proposal in terms of whether you (1) understand who is needed, (2) understand who is missing and (3) have a plan to either get them to the table or deal with their absence.  Explain how you not only will work with key community groups but how you will engage the community as a whole regarding the process. CARE's Level 1 intent is to engage the community as a whole regarding the identification, education and the understanding of the environmental problems and their ideas of what should be their prioritized concerns.  List all groups that have already agreed to work with you on this project and their reason for inclusion. Use of a table which includes the name of the partner, which part of the community they represent and what they bring to or will do for the group is a good way to make this clear to reviewers.  Indicate if you have ever worked with any of these groups in the past, and if so, when and what were the results. Please understand that consultants who are going to be paid for working on the CARE project are not considered businesses when we look to see if you have businesses represented in your partnership.  To the extent known, spell out the roles the different organizations will play and the processes through which the organizations will work together and communicate.  For any organization listed include a contact name with a phone number in order for EPA to consider that organization to be part of the partnership.  Please include letters of commitment from your partners wherever possible. (The discussion of the organizations you will work with will count against your page total - the letter of commitment will not). Remember EPA gives more weight to letters of specific commitment over general support. EPA reserves the right to contact organizations to verify their involvement.  Explain your plans for providing meaningful stakeholder participation in the decisionmaking process and facilitating stakeholder meetings and your plans and/or process for bringing the diverse group of stakeholders together to achieve consensus.  Also, include (if known) partners within your community that may need to be involved but are not a part of this proposal. Explain why these partners are not included. 47


4. Alignment with CARE Strategies: Discuss the connection between the three specific CARE strategies listed in Section V.A, Evaluation Criteria 3 and the problems the CARE project is intended to address, the approach the applicant plans to use, and how the proposed work aligns with these strategies. EPA recommends a separate short write-up for each strategy. 5. Tracking and Measuring Environmental Results:  Describe the applicant's plan for tracking environmental results and what performance measures will be used (outputs and outcomes). Outputs are what is done and what the level of effort is (i.e. will hold a number of meetings throughout the district). Outcomes are the quantitative and qualitative effects of the results from the actions taken (i.e. the meetings engaged four additional neighborhood groups to commit to the project).  Identify indicators and performance measures the applicant will use to determine at the conclusion of the project if goals were achieved and if the project is a success. For additional information regarding performance measures and tracking, refer to "Developing Performance Measures" Section I.C.5 for general information and Appendix A "CARE Required Performance Measures" for specific information. 6. Programmatic Capacity:  Describe other projects that have been successfully managed, or organizational features and controls that will help ensure the project can be effectively managed and successfully completed.  Describe and provide substantiation of the applicant's ability to manage this CARE project.  Describe the system(s) that will be used to appropriately manage, expend, and account for federal funds.  If the applicant is, or has been, a recipient of an EPA grant/cooperative agreement in the last 3 years the applicant must provide information regarding compliance reporting measures, and annual financial status reporting. The following list is applicable to Level II Agreements only. 1. Environmental issues and concerns:  Include information from the stakeholder group's multi-media investigation of the risks in the community.  Specifically identify the extent of the environmental and human health toxic problems in the community.  Describe the severity of the environmental and human health problems in the community. 48


2. Project Goals and Performance Plan and Budget Accountability: The Agency encourages applicants to use a one-page Logic Model to detail the project's plan. (See Appendix A for information on resources to help you develop a Logic Model)  Specifically identify measurable project goals and outputs;  Describe how the planned project work will directly address the community's needs.  Enumerate in the proposed tasks, each task's milestones (i.e. dates by which tasks will be carried out and outputs will be produced.)  Identify what persons or organizations will have lead responsibility for tasks and milestones.  The budget narrative should show support and alignment with the project goals and performance plan.  The applicant must discuss the relationship between the risk prioritization process identified through the collaborative stakeholder process (Level I activities) and the current project goals and activities being proposed in this Level II project. The scope of the CARE work project need only reflect the federally funded work 3. Past and Continued Success of Broad-Based Stakeholder Group: This criterion is designed to inform us about the work that you did in the past so we can judge if you are ready to be a CARE Level II community. Therefore, when answering this question you need to focus on what you have done and what you will do.  Describe the community's risk reduction priorities and describe the process through which the community priorities were identified.  Describe how broad-based the current stakeholder group is. Explain how the group represents all relevant constituencies in the community? Provide specific information on how all sectors of the community, especially community residents, were involved in the process. The point of this is to allow us to evaluate your proposal in terms of whether you (1) understand who is needed, (2) understand who is missing and (3) have a plan to either get them to the table or deal with their absence.  Describe how consensus was built within the partnership and the community to determine the community's priorities.  Describe how effective the stakeholder group has been in examining the toxic 
 problems in the community?
  Describe how the community members and partnerships have participated and will participate in the planning, performance, and evaluation of the Level II proposed project.  Substantiate the group and it's its accomplishments by submitting information about the already formed Stakeholder Group including membership, meeting notes and any 49


reports or work products produced.  Be clear about how you identified and prioritized risks. Be clear about how you will come to consensus on the actions you will take to reduce those risks. 4. Ability to Leverage New Resources and Sustain Community Efforts to Understand and Improve the Environment:  Describe funds or other resources that have been committed, will be committed and/or have been sought to support the goals of this project (in addition to the EPA CARE proposal).  Detail if there are current or future plans to solicit funding from any other EPA source(s) for work related to this proposal.  Include letters of commitment from your partners wherever possible. Letters of commitment do not count toward the page limitation.  Provide a plan for leveraging local and national funding resources to address community priorities and can describe how Level II CARE funds will be used as a part of this broader plan.  Describe how the applicant will develop a partnership and community infrastructure so that the stakeholder group can continue the community-based environmental and health protection work in the future. 5. Alignment with CARE Strategies: Discuss the connection between the two strategies listed in Section V.A, Evaluation Criteria #4, the problems the CARE project is intended to address, the approach the applicant plans to use, and how the proposed work aligns with the three strategies. EPA recommends, but does not require, a separate short write-up for each strategy. 6. Tracking and Measuring Environmental Results:  Describe the applicant's plan for tracking environmental results and what performance measures will be used (outputs and outcomes). Outputs are what is done and what the level of effort is (i.e. will hold a number of meetings throughout the district). Outcomes are the quantitative and qualitative effects of the results from the actions taken (i.e. the meetings engaged four additional neighborhood groups to commit to the project).  Identify indicators and performance measures the applicant will use to determine at 50


the conclusion of the project if goals were achieved and if the project was a success. For additional information regarding performance measures and tracking, refer to "Developing Performance Measures" Section I.C.5 for general information and Appendix A "CARE Required Performance Measures" for specific information. 7. Programmatic Capacity:  Describe other projects that have been successfully managed, or organizational features and controls that will help ensure the project can be effectively managed and successfully completed.  Describe and provide substantiation of the applicant's ability to manage this CARE project.  Describe the system(s) that will be used to appropriately manage, expend, and account for federal funds. If the applicant is, or has been, a recipient of an EPA grant/cooperative agreement in the last 3 years the applicant must provide information regarding compliance reporting measures, and annual financial status reporting.
