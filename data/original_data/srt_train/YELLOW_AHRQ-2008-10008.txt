Kenneth Robinson, Healthy Memphis Common Table, asked AHRQ for assistance in tailoring messages to African American consumers. What specific assistance could AHRQ offer to CVEs in this area? Have we given up on doing printed messages at the fourth grade level (Lazar mentioned the need for more verbal communication)? What about educational materials that are tailored to racial and/or ethnic consumer subpopulations? Are there different media or messages that have been found to be more/less effective with these subpopulations? For example, is cable more effective in reaching these subpopulations than radio? Robinson also asked that Allan Lazar share lessons learned from the study he referred to in his presentation on targeting and tailoring educational messages to these consumer subpopulations. Washington- Puget Sound Health Alliance noted the diversity of the many ethnic and cultural groups in their region, which can be overwhelming.

85.0 2/4/08-3/31/08 1.0 Quality& Efficiency  Measurement AHRQ Resources MA HCUP session - questions related to outpatient care data • Does ambulatory data capture freestanding outpatient sites? Elixhauser responded that it varies by state.

• A Massachusetts Healthcare Quality Partners representative asked about ambulatory sensitive conditions. Since these conditions are reported as hospital measures, the representative reported that his organization is not able to link the indicator back to the relevant ambulatory care episode. In response, Elixhauser agreed that ambulatory sensitive condition indicators cannot be connected to the outpatient setting. However, these indicators can be used to identify areas where there are a high proportion of preventable admissions.

86.0 2/4/08-3/31/08 1.0 Quality& Efficiency  Measurement AHRQ Resources HCUP session - questions related to inpatient care data • Does AHRQ include both admission and discharge diagnosis? Only discharge, Elixhauser responded.

• How can you differentiate problems in hospitals if you do not know why patients presented? Elixhauser responded that starting in January, for Medicare, hospitals need to start submitting present on admission data to determine what presented during the course of stay. Many states will be starting to submit this data soon.

• The dollar values in administrative data are based on charges rather than cost. Can HCUP address this problem? Elixhauser: Yes, you’re right. AHRQ has cost to charge rations that can get at an estimate of cost. What would be helpful is actually information on price, but that is considered proprietary. Maine is currently collecting information on price from all sites of care and that is where we want to go eventually.

• What diagnosis information is available? What does HCUP capture in terms of diagnoses? Elixhauser: HCUP captures principal discharge diagnosis and up to 29 secondary diagnoses. 

• Does database capture any information on rehabilitation facilities? Elixhauser: At this point, HCUP does not capture any data on long term care.

• How about data on readmissions? Elixhauser: In order to look at readmissions, you have to track over time and not every state makes personal identifier available. While readmission may be a good proxy for quality, it has shortcomings.

• In response to a question regarding whether HCUP captures data on admissions from the emergency department, Elixhauser responded that the emergency department database only includes data on patients who are seen in the emergency department and released from the emergency department. If a patient is admitted from the emergency department, his/her data will appear in the inpatient database.

87.0 2/4/08-3/31/08 1.0 Quality& Efficiency  Measurement AHRQ Resources HCUP Session - Questions Related to Data Collection and Validity • In response to a question about the validity of discharge abstracts vs. medical records, Elixhauser responded that AHRQ is now observing high correlations between discharge abstracts and medical records, especially for principal diagnoses.

• A question followed regarding two original HCUP indicators, AMI after surgery and pneumonia after surgery. Elixhauser explained that researchers at UCSF Stanford determined that these indicators are not ready yet for “prime time” and would have let through too many cases. Elixhauser indicated that soon, we will be able to use present on admission indicators and that these indicators will significantly enhance existing measures.

• A participant asked whether AHRQ has undertaken any work on developing emergency department indicators. Elixhauser responded that additional funding is needed in this area.

• In response to a question, Elixhauser indicated that AHRQ captures all ICD9 digits/characters.

• Janet Sullivan of the Hudson Health Plan posed a question regarding the age of HCUP data, noting that 2004 and 2005 appear to be the most recent years for which a full data set is available. Elixhauser responded that AHRQ now has national level data for 2005 and will be releasing 2006 data at the end of May. She noted that AHRQ can only go as fast as the slowest state and that the agency is exploring ways to do modeling so that earlier estimates can be generated for those states that have not submitted their data. In response to a question, Elixhauser stated that, until a full national data set becomes available, CVEs would need to request 2006 and 2007 data directly from those state organizations that are collecting this data. She noted, however, that data acquired directly from such organizations would lack the uniform definitions that AHRQ applies to the full national data set, thereby making across state comparisons difficult. 

• A participant asked whether it would be possible to ask individual state organizations to add the hospital identifier to the database because HCUP does not allow users to access those identifiers. Elixhauser restated that the nature of AHRQ’s agreements with state partners does not allow for individual hospitals to be identified deliberately or inadvertently. She stated “our philosophy is that it is up to the individual states to collect individual level quality data.” She also indicated that AHRQ is exploring the feasibility of providing software to enable CVEs to collect individual hospital level quality data. She asked the audience whether such software would be helpful. About 15 individuals raised their hands to indicate it would be helpful to have software that would enable them to apply HCUP at the local level with hospital identifiers. Tennessee and Oregon were among those CVEs who indicated it would be helpful.

• Regarding the preventable hospitalization costs (PHC) tool, one individual asked if this data is risk adjusted or adjusted for insurance status. Elixhauser responded that there are breakdowns by age and sex, and by payer.

• Does the PHC tool allow you to look at charge data? Elixhauser: Yes.

• Mark Sonneborn, Minnesota Healthcare Value Exchange, shared his perspective that HCUP has been a very valuable tool in Minnesota. He noted that problems with ambulatory sensitive conditions are often access problems. Michael Young, Erie County Medical Center, commented that HCUP is valuable, noting that “there is no way a single hospital could pull this data together.” He said that the HCUP data base acts as our “speedometer by giving us enough data to begin to learn.”

• One health plan representative stated that it would be useful to have software that would enable the plan to identify patients. So, for example, if a health plan is having a disproportionate number of patients who have ambulatory sensitive conditions from a specific clinic, the plan would be able to share that information with the clinic’s physicians. Elixhauser responded that the HCUP database is capable of doing this.

88.0 2/4/08-3/31/18 1.0 Quality& Efficiency  Measurement Medicare data ME/MI-GDAHC/PA-PRHI/WA-PSHA/WI/UT/MN/TN-HMCT Improved access to Medicare data (8) Interest in access to raw Medicare data for physician groups ran high among participants. Maine CVE Alliance, Michigan’s Greater Detroit Area Health Council, Pittsburg Regional Health Initiative, Puget Sound Health Alliance, Healthy Memphis Common Table, Wisconsin Healthcare Value Exchange, UPV, and Minnesota Healthcare Value Exchange all requested access to Medicare data, or clarification regarding the level of access that AHRQ will facilitate. (Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Value Exchange reiterated this request for access to Medicare data during its March call with CHI. Similarly, during their March call with CHI, UPV asked for information on when Medicare data will be available so that the CVE could share this information with the health plans in the state. This information would be helpful because the CVE plans to quickly match the CMS physician level data with health plan data from the state). Participants noted that the agenda did not directly address this topic. Chris Queram, Wisconsin Healthcare Value Exchange, asked specifically regarding AHRQ’s view on providing CVEs with access to this data. A similar question was raised on day two by Janice Whitehouse of Greater Detroit Area Health Council who asked Secretary Leavitt to elaborate on the availability of Medicare data to CVEs. Maine CVE Alliance noted that “we need CMS data – size of denominator makes a difference – providers will pay more attention with larger numbers of patients included in analysis.”

120.0 2/4/08-3/31/08 1.0 Public Reporting Cultural competency/Literacy TN-HMCT Address literacy At the conclusion of the HCUP presentation on day one, a CVE representative noted that while this information is “fantastic,” she wondered about the person using this information to make a choice. Specifically, she raised the issue of literacy. “I am not sure that most people would be able to look at this information and appreciate its value.” Irene Fraser indicated that AHRQ has contracted with Shoshanna Sofaer to examine how best to present information and has created two templates. Peggy McNamara indicated that those templates are available on AHRQ’s Web site.

This comment regarding literacy was echoed on day two of the meeting during the session led by Dr. Sofaer, when Denise Bollheimer, Healthy Memphis Common Table, asked the panelists if they had suggestions for public reporting literature that is aimed at populations with a low level of literacy. 

121.0 2/4/08-3/31/08 1.0 Public Reporting Data presentation MI-AFH/UT/WA-PSHA/PA-PRHI/ME Standardize reporting. (5) Michigan’s Alliance for Health requested assistance with “structuring formula for content/standardization” in the area of public reporting. In a similar vein, Scott Williams, UPV, challenged CVEs during the session led by Dr. Sofaer to develop standardized reporting language so that the CVEs “do not spin our wheels for another ten years.” Sofaer responded by noting the importance of standardizing measures first, then scoring, and only then can we begin to standardize reporting language. Puget Sound Health Alliance also noted the need for a common platform or approach to effective presentation of data that works for many population segments. Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative echoed this request, noting the need for help in developing a consistent presentation of information across CVEs. During its baseline call with CHI, Maine CVE Alliance made a similar request, for standardization of reporting formats based on what resonates better with consumers.
122.0 2/4/08-3/31/08 1.0 Public Reporting Patient experience TN-HMCT Integrate physician satisfaction surveys.

                                              SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/ SPECIFICATION/ WORK STATEMENT



Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the
necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise
provided by the Government as needed to perform the Statement of Work below:

A. Background statement/project history

Support for local, multi-stakeholder quality collaboratives, referred to as Chartered Value Exchanges (CVEs), represents one of the Agency’s
efforts to systematically foster public-private efforts to use evidence-based strategies to improve health care quality and contain costs, one
community at a time.    Applications from twenty-four (24) local or regional collaboratives have been awarded CVE status, which entitles them to
participate in AHRQ’s CVE Learning Network, the vehicle for receiving technical assistance from experts and from each other, and the focus of
this solicitation.

The 24 collaboratives, which may increase in number over time, are tasked with measuring and reporting on physician or hospital practice in a
meaningful and transparent way to influence value-based decisionmaking by consumers and purchasers of health care.  Some collaboratives have
been in existence a number of years and are mature; other collaboratives were formed only in the last year.  A fundamental principle of CVEs is
active participation by representatives from four stakeholder groups -- providers, purchasers, health plans and consumer organizations – in CVE
activities and CVE decisionmaking.

The purpose of this solicitation is to provide technical assistance to the CVEs, which succeeds a previous contract that has been providing
technical assistance to CVEs since March 2008.

Additional information about the local, multi-stakeholder quality collaboratives can be found in the following attachment:  Attachment # 5:
Slidedeck of CVE Program.

B. Objectives

The goal of this award is to implement an evidence-based technical assistance program for 24 (and possibly more) CVE teams, each of which
includes representatives from four stakeholder groups: providers, purchasers, health plans and consumer organizations as well as other local
stakeholders (such as state data organizations) as identified by the CVE leadership team.

The four primary venues for providing technical assistance are:

    ■ Private Web site for CVEs
    ■ Webinar series
    ■ In-person conferences
    ■ Workgroup on standard public report elements

Technical assistance priorities are 100% driven by needs of the collaboratives, identified informally and formally by discussions with the
collaboratives, and prioritized in partnership with Agency staff.  This contract will focus on demand-driven, practical, applied topics that are
of direct, practical interest to collaborative teams.   A wide range of technical and practical topics will be covered.  Topics will include but
are not limited to: 1) Collaborative Leadership and CVE Sustainability; 2) Public at-large Engagement; 3) Data Aggregation and Quality and
Efficiency Measurement; 4) Public Reporting on Quality and Efficiency; 5) Provider Incentives for Quality; 6) Consumer Incentives for Quality;
7) Cross-organizational Capacity for Improving Quality; and 8) Health Information Technology.

      Subtask 5.12:  Prepare participant tent cards.



Unpriced Agency options.   In future the Contractor may be asked to develop a proposal for the following additional tasks.  Provide a technical
response to each of the unpriced Agency options (identified by task #).  These will be evaluated in accordance with the Technical Evaluation
Criteria.  NOTE:  A cost proposal is NOT required for the unpriced options.

Task 6: In the event new CVEs are added, vendor to complete related requisite tasks to include them in CVE Learning Network (eg, conduct welcome
calls, draft Web site CVE profiles, conduct baseline interviews, etc)

Task 7: In addition to Task #5, Agency may opt to convene additional topic-specific, time-limited workgroups and/or special workshops.  As an
example of a workgroup, the Agency may, at the suggestion of CVEs, opt to convene a workgroup to identify and analyze use of
cost/price/efficiency measures by CVEs, eg, in report cards, pay for performance and consumer incentives.  As an example of a workshop, the
Agency may opt to host a workshop just for provider participants of CVEs to identify and analyze strategies for involving the broader provider
community in quality improvement, or a workshop just for consumer participants of CVEs on ‘health care acronyms 101.’

Task 8: While most technical assistance is designed for all CVEs or a cluster of CVEs, occasions may arise for which the Agency opts to arrange
and facilitate one-on-one consulting to address CVE TA need that is unique to one or more specific CVEs.

Task 9: Refine (and in some cases develop) a demand-driven, applied, evidence-based tool or product, such as a synthesis, case study or decision
guide, evaluation, tailored for CVEs.

Unpriced Agency options.   In future the Contractor may be asked to develop a proposal for the following additional tasks.  Provide a technical
response to each of the unpriced Agency options (identified by task #).  These will be evaluated in accordance with the Technical Evaluation
Criteria.  NOTE:  A cost proposal is NOT required for the unpriced options.

Task 5: In the event new CVEs are added, vendor to complete related requisite tasks to include them in CVE Learning Network (eg, conduct welcome
calls, draft Web site CVE profiles, conduct baseline interviews, etc)

Task 6: In addition to Task #5, Agency may opt to convene additional topic-specific, time-limited workgroups and/or special workshops.  As an
example of a workgroup, the Agency may, at the suggestion of CVEs, opt to convene a workgroup to identify and analyze use of
cost/price/efficiency measures by CVEs, eg, in report cards, pay for performance and consumer incentives.  As an example of a workshop, the
Agency may opt to host a workshop just for provider participants of CVEs to identify and analyze strategies for involving the broader provider
community in quality improvement, or a workshop just for consumer participants of CVEs on ‘health care acronyms 101.’

Task 7: While most technical assistance is designed for all CVEs or a cluster of CVEs, occasions may arise for which the Agency opts to arrange
and facilitate one-on-one consulting to address CVE TA need that is unique to one or more specific CVEs.

Task 8: Refine (and in some cases develop) a demand-driven, applied, evidence-based tool or product, such as a synthesis, case study or decision
guide, evaluation, tailored for CVEs.

                                                       SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

H.1   RELEASE AND USE AND COPYRIGHT OF DATA FIRST PRODUCED FROM WORK PERFORMED UNDER THIS CONTRACT

      (a)  Release and Use – Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this
      Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools,
      methodologies, or recorded product based on such data.


      (b)  Release and Use – Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections
      afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its
      contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that


      No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of
      activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless
      such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other
      form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its
      publication or release in other form.


      In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and
      analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --


      (1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project
      and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any
      comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.


      The purpose of such consultation is to assure that:


      (A) identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been
      obtained;
      (B) the confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated;
      and
      (C) the quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.


      (2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b)(1) above,
      if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1)(C) above:


      (A)   the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use
      of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory
      standards referenced in condition (1)(C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
       (B)  the Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral
      presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:


      THIS presentation/ publication/or other product is derived from work supported under a contract with THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND
      QUALITY (AHRQ) Contract#   .  However, this presentation/ publication/or other product HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED by the agency.


      (c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation
      or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this
      contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:


      IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH THIS REPORT, PRESENTATION, OR OTHER FORM OF DISCLOSURE IS BASED IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAW, SECTION
      934(c) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c).  NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES SUPPLYING THE
      INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT.  ANY CONFIDENTIAL IDENTIFIABLE
      INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED.


      (d)  Copyright – Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of
      data, AHRQ, through its Contracting Officer, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c)(1)(i) to the Contractor to establish claim to
      copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract
      that are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works.  When claim to
      copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government
      sponsorship (including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published
      or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office.  In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to
      grant to AHRQ, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce,
      prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.  A
      description of this license will be incorporated into the copyright notices required above.


      (e)  Subcontracts.  Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the
      Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may
      not further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor.  No clause may be included to diminish the Government’s
      stated requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this
      contract.

H.2    LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

      Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section
      H.1 of this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision
      are necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities.  Records of the Contractor's performance, including the
      Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an
      element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews.


H.3   SUBCONTRACTS

      Award of any subcontract is subject to the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer upon review of the supporting documentation.
      Failure to obtain prior written approval of the Contracting Officer may result in disallowance of use of Federal funds to cover services
      under the subcontract. The contractor must include in any subcontracts executed or used to provide the support specified in this contract
      the terms of requirements H.1, H.2, H.7, H.9 and H.10.  These requirements are to be included without substantive alteration, and no clause
      may be included to diminish these requirements. If approved, a copy of the signed subcontract shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.

H.4   LATE PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT

      Late payment of debts owed the Government by the Contractor, arising from whatever cause, under this contract/order shall bear interest at
      a rate or rates to be established in accordance with the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual.  For purposes of this provision, late
      payments are defined as payments received by the Government more than 30 days after the Contractor has been notified in writing by the
      Contracting Officer of:

      a.    The basis of indebtedness.
      b.    The amount due.
      c.    The fact that interest will be applied if payment is not received within 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice.
      d.    The approximate interest rate that will be charged.

H.5   PRIVACY ACT

      The Privacy Act clauses cited in Section I (FAR 52.224-1 and 52.224-2) are applicable to the consultant records kept by the Contractor for
      the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

      You are hereby notified that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C.
      552a(i)) to the same extent as employees of the Department.  The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee is aware that he/she
      can be subjected to criminal penalties for violations of the Act.  Disposition instructions:  Records are to be destroyed after contract
      closeout is completed and final payment is made and in accordance with IRS regulations.

H.6   PRO-CHILDREN ACT of 1994

      The Pro-Children Act of 1994, P.L. 103-227, imposes restrictions on smoking where certain federally funded children’s’ services are
      provided.  P.L. 103-227 states in pertinent part:


      PHS strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the non-use of all tobacco
      products.  In addition, P.L. 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion
      of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided
      to children.”

H.7   SALARY CAP GUIDE NOTICE

      Pursuant to the applicable HHS appropriations acts cited in the table below, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct
      salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the salary level in effect on the date the expense is incurred as shown in the table below.

      For purposes of the salary limitation, the terms direct salary, salary, and institutional base salary have the same meaning and are
      collectively referred to as direct salary in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays
      for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Direct
      salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes
      fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative
      [F&A] costs).

      The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals performing under subcontracts. However, it does not apply to fees paid to
      consultants. If this is a multiple-year contract, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an
      individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when
      the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract funding.

*  Weights for out years may be adjusted depending on potential changes in priorities.

** Weights for un-priced optional tasks (Performance Factors 6-9) will be specified as options are exercised. These may require adjustments in
weights for Performance Factors 1-5.

On a semi-annual basis, the Contractor’s products and services will be evaluated in terms of the above performance factors by an Award Fee
Evaluation Group (AFEG). The AFEG will consist of the Project Officer, the Contracting Officer or his/her designee, and, as appropriate, other
Government officials selected by the Project Officer (depending on specific expertise) and approved by the Contracting Officer.

Each member of the Award Fee Evaluation Group will evaluate the Contractor’s  performance  against  the  performance  standards  of  quality  and
timeliness listed in Exhibit 1.

A numerical rating scale of 0 to 100 will be used. The scale is defined as follows:


|                                                                       |                       |                   |                      |

|margin; the performance monitor can cite few areas for improvement, all|Outstanding            |90 - 100           |100%                  |
|of which are minor. Required rework is minimal.                        |                       |                   |                      |
|Exceeds Expectations-  Contractor’s performance exceeds standards, and |Exceeds Expectations   |                   |                      |
|although there may be several areas for improvement, these are more    |                       |80 – 89            |80%                   |
|than offset by better performance in other areas. Required rework is   |                       |                   |                      |
|limited.                                                               |                       |                   |                      |
|Satisfactory-  Contractor’s performance is generally satisfactory, and |Satisfactory           |60 – 79            |40%                   |
|areas for improvement are approximately offset by better performance in|                       |                   |                      |
|other areas. Required rework is moderate.                              |                       |                   |                      |
|Unsatisfactory-  Contractor’s performance is less than standards by a  |Unacceptable           |Below 60           |Base Fee Reduced by   |
|substantial margin, and the performance monitor can cite many areas for|                       |                   |50%                   |
|improvement which are not offset by better performance in other areas. |                       |                   |                      |
|Required rework is extensive.                                          |                       |                   |                      |

Each member of the AFEG will give each performance factor a numerical rating, and those ratings will be averaged. An average score of less than
60 (Unsatisfactory) will result in a reduction in the base fee of 50% for the performance factor for the rating period.  An average score of 60-
79 (Satisfactory) will result in award of 40% of the Award Fee for the performance factor. An average score of 80-89 (Exceeds Expectations) will
result in award of 80% of the Award Fee, and an average of 90-100 (Outstanding) will result in award of 100% of the Award Fee for the
performance factor. The Award Fee determinations are not subject to the disputes clause.

H.10  SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE

This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or
Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include
reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned
or Department-funded Web site.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies
(EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of,
the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability
to access government information and services.

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text,
audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to
access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or
consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable
Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of
any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility
of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material.
1 - Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is
called for under the contract.

      [ ]   (1) Certificate of Concurrent Submission of Disclosure Statement.
           The offeror hereby certifies that, as a part of the offer, copies of the Disclosure Statement have been submitted as follows: (i)

            Date of Disclosure Statement:__________________________
            Name and Address of Cognizant
             ACO or Federal official where filed:
           The offeror further certifies that practices used in estimating costs in pricing this proposal are consistent with the cost

           receive net awards of negotiated prime contracts and subcontracts subject to CAS totaling more than $25 million in the cost
           accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted.  The offeror further certifies that if such
           status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately.

      [ ]   (4) Certificate of Interim Exemption.

           The offeror hereby certifies that (i) the offeror first exceeded the monetary exemption for disclosure, as defined in (3) of this
           subsection, in the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this offer was submitted and (ii) in accordance
           with 48 CFR, Subpart 9903.202-1, the offeror is not yet required to submit a Disclosure Statement.  The offeror further certifies
           that if an award resulting from this proposal has not been made within 90 days after the end of that period, the offeror will

           million or more in the current cost accounting period may not claim this exemption (4).  Further, the exemption applies only in
           connection with proposals submitted before expiration of the 90-day period following the cost accounting period in which the monetary
           exemption was exceeded.

II.   Cost Accounting Standards - Eligibility for Modified Contract Coverage

      If the offeror is eligible to use the modified provisions of 48 CFR, Subpart 9903.201-2(b) and elects to do so, the offeror shall indicate
      by checking the box below.  Checking the box below shall mean that the resultant contract is subject to the Disclosure and Consistency of
      Cost Accounting Practices clause in lieu of the Cost Accounting Standards clause.

           exceeding $1 million.  The offeror further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the
           offeror will advise the
            Contracting Officer immediately.

Caution:  An offeror may not claim the above eligibility for modified contract coverage if this proposal is expected to result in the award of a
CAS-covered contract of $25 million or more or if, during its current cost accounting period, the offeror has been awarded a single CAS-covered
prime contract or subcontract of $25 million or more.

III.  Additional Cost Accounting Standards Applicable to Existing Contracts

      The offeror shall indicate below whether award of the contemplated contract would, in accordance with subparagraph (a)(3) of the Cost
      Accounting Standards clause, require a change in established cost accounting practices affecting existing contracts and subcontracts.

      The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the nonuse
      of all tobacco products.  In addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in
      some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development
      services are provided to children.


                                               CERTIFICATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor
facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood
development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either
directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's
services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply
to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers
whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the
provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an
administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and
will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain
provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

L.3   INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION (MAY 2001)
      ALTERNATE I (JAN 2004)(FAR 52.215-1)

      (a)   Definitions.  As used in this provision –

           “Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer’s
           discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.

           “In writing,” “writing,” or “written” means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated,
           and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.

           “Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation’s closing date and time, or made in response to an
           amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.

           “Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a
           Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations.

           “Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays,
           Sundays, and legal holidays.  However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, then the period shall include
           the next working day.

      (b)   Amendments to solicitations.  If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged.
           Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).

      (c)   Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

            (1)  Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to
                 proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the
                 solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the
                 offeror.  Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the
                 information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision.

            (2)  The first page of the proposal must show—

                       (i)   The solicitation number;

                       (ii)  The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);
                 (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions  included in the solicitation
                       and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item;

                 (iv)  Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to
                       negotiate on the offeror’s behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and

                 (v)   Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal.  Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied
                       by evidence of that agent’s authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office.

            (3)  Submissions, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

                 (i)   Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modification or revisions, so as to reach the Government
                       office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation.  If no time is specified in the
                       solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that
                       proposal or revision is due.

                 (ii)  (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the
                       exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is
                       made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and -

                       (1)   If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the
                            initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date
                            specified for receipt of proposals; or

                       (2)   There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation  designated for
                            receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

                       (3)   It is the only proposal received.

                       (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the
                       Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

                 (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that
                       installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral
                       testimony or statements of Government personnel.

                       (iv)  If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received
                       at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government
                       requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be
                       extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes
                       resume.

                 (v)   Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award.  Oral proposals in response to oral
                       solicitations may be withdrawn orally.  If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via
                       facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, “Facsimile
                       Proposals.”  Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative’s
                       identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

                       (4)   Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of
                            items.

                       (5)   Offerors shall submit proposals submitted in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted
                            by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency
                            Offers, is included in the solicitation.

                       (6)   Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and
                            may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.

                       (7)   Offers may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.

                       (8)   Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award.  Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the
                            Contracting Officer.

      (d)   Offer expiration date.  Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation
           cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror).


      (e)   Restriction on disclosure and use of data.  Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the
           public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall —

            (1)  Mark the title page with the following legend:

                 “This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or
                 disclosed–in whole or in part–for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal.” If, however, a contract is awarded to this
                 offeror as a result of–or in connection with– the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate,
                 use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s
                 right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  The data subject to
                 this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and

            (2)  Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

                 “Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.”

      (f)   Contract award.

            (1)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose
                 proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

            (2)  The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.

            (3)  The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

            (4)  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals
                 have been determined to be within the competitive range.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals
                 that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the
                 Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an
                 efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the
                 offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

            (5)  The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost
                 or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

            (6)  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in
                 the Government’s best interest to do so.

            (7)  Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

            (8)  The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line
                 items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more
                 contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis
                 techniques.  A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable
                 risk to the Government.

            (9)  If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating
                 performance or schedule risk.

            (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in
                 the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

            (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if
                 applicable:

                 (i)   The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.

                 (ii)  The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance
                       information on the debriefed offeror.

                 (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection

                   iv) A summary of the rationale for award


                    v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

                   vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offerors as to whether source-selection procedures set
                       forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

L.9   GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

      Introduction

      The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of proposals.


       a.   Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that a cost-reimbursement performance based contract will be awarded.  In
      addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable
      to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or
      procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

      b.        Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the
      offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover
      letter of this solicitation.  Proposals will be typewritten, reproduced on letter sized paper and will be legible in all required copies.


      c.        Separation of Technical, Past Performance Information, and Business Proposal:  The proposal shall be in 4 separate parts. To
      expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:

           I.          TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:  See Technical Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.10). Please mark as original or copy.

             II. PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: See Past Performance Information Instructions for format (L.11)

            III. BUSINESS PROPOSAL:  See Business Proposal Instructions for recommended format (L.13).

             IV. SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN See Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan Instructions for recommended
                 format (L.12).

           Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and
           concurrently with, evaluation of the other.


      d.    Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M,
           Evaluation/Award Criteria.

      e.    Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your
           proposal will become part of the official contract file.

      f.    Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a
           complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.
           Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted.

      g.    Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks
           to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the
           principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of
           the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

            Therefore:

           (1)   The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the
                 Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

            (2)  Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.

            (3)  The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a
                 discussion as to whether to award a contract.

            (4)  Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

            (5)  The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:


                 -to the cognizant audit agency and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) for auditing;
                 -to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
                 -to respond to Congressional inquiries; and
                       -to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.

            In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals
           are requested to disclose their social security number.

           Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and
           efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is
           provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

      h.    The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.  It is also brought to your
           attention that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public
           funds in connection with this or any acquisition action.

           The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial
           prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

L.10  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

      The technical proposal shall contain an original and nine (9) copies.   The technical proposal described below shall be limited to 100
      pages not including biographic sketches, with no less than a 11 point font, double-spaced (lists of deliverables, person loading charts,
      and similar materials need not be double-spaced, so long as they are legible). Brief biographic sketches or CVs (less than ten pages in
      length) providing the relevant qualifications necessary for this effort are only required for key personnel.   The technical proposal shall
      not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, labor mix, materials,
      subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be
      evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of
      these instructions. Lengthy proposals and voluminous appendices are neither needed nor desired as they are difficult to read and evaluate
      and may indicate the offeror’s inability to concisely state their proposal. Appendices are to be provided electronically in MS Office
      format on CD, in the same quantity as the technical proposal.


      a.    Recommended Technical Proposal Format

           The offeror’s proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a
           detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work.  Technical proposals shall not merely paraphrase the requirements of
           the Agency’s scope of work or parts thereof, or use of phrases such as “will comply” or “standard techniques will be employed.”  The
           technical proposal must include a detailed description of the techniques and procedures to be used in achieving the proposed end
           results in compliance with the requirements of the Agency’s scope of work.

            (1)  Cover Page:  The name of the proposing organization, author(s) of the technical proposal, the RFP number and the title of the
                 RFP should appear on the cover. The cover page must also include the DUNS and TIN as well as a point of contact and contact
                 information.  One (1) manually signed original copy of the proposal and the number of copies specified in the RFP cover letter
                 are required.

            (2)  Table of Contents:  Provide sufficient detail so that all important elements of the proposal can be located readily.

           3) Introduction:  This should be a one or two page summary outlining the proposed work, your interest in submitting a proposal, and
              the importance of this effort in relation to your overall operation.


           4) Technical Discussion:  The offeror shall prepare a technical discussion which addresses evaluation criteria A, B, C & D below
              (including their subcriteria). The offeror shall further state that no deviations or exceptions to the Statement of Work (SOW) are
              taken.  The evaluation criteria (and their respective subcriteria) are as follows:

           Technical proposals submitted in response to this RFP shall address each of the items described below, and shall be organized in the
           same manner and within the page limitations specified.  Proposals shall be prepared in double-spaced format, with numbered pages.



A. Technical Approach


      1. The Offeror shall submit a narrative which clearly addresses how he or she plans to develop, design, and implement the Statement of Work
      within the time constraints of the project.


      2.  The Offeror shall address the technical approach proposed for each of the 5 tasks required by the Statement of Work. The 5 tasks are:
      1) undertake administrative and planning activities; 2) maintain and update private Web site for CVEs; 3) convene Webinar series,
      approximately 2-3 per month; 4) convene 2 in-person meetings per year for roughly 175 persons each; and 5) convene workgroup on standard
      public report elements.

      3. The Offeror shall develop and present an agenda for: 1) a hypothetical Webinar on “resource use measures and applications for CVEs”; 2)
      a hypothetical conference session designed to provide CVEs with CVE networking opportunities; and 3) a hypothetical conference session to
      provide technical assistance on “aligning a specific quality improvement strategy across-organizations, e.g., hospitals, within a
      community.”

      4. The Offeror also shall discuss the technical approach for the 4 unpriced options identified in the Statement of Work.

      5. The Offeror shall discuss geographic proximity of its office (or satellite office) vis a vis the Agency’s office.


B.  Organizational Qualifications and Experience

It is essential that the Offeror demonstrate the technical ability and subject matter expertise to design and conduct the various activities
identified in the Statement of Work.  Offeror shall describe organizational structure and capabilities that will ensure project needs are met.
Specifically, Offeror shall:

      1.  Demonstrate organization’s past experience with Federal contract(s).


      2.  Demonstrate organization’s experience in managing distance learning programs, ie, Webinar and Web site-based learning, large technical
      conferences of a similar size and nature, and topic-specific, time-limited workgroup.

C.  Management and Staffing Plan

The Offeror shall demonstrate the ability to manage work and personnel resources in a timely manner to meet this project’s needs.  Specifically,

   5. Describe system for quality control of work performed including documents to be produced, and proposed system for management control and
      contract provision compliance.


   6. Describe how Offeror would minimize or avoid the following management problems (and other problems) that may arise:
        a. Contract staffed by too many people, resulting in silos of information with burden on Agency to become defacto day-to-day manager of
           team and resulting in confusion among CVEs who are being contacted by too many different contractor staff;
        b. Inappropriate assignment of high-level tasks to junior staff (ie, with little/no expertise in relevant subject matter) making the
           task of translating nuanced comments from CVEs difficult; and,
        c. Contract team being used to a particular routine such that a change by Agency (eg, different format for Webinar, etc.) proves
           difficult to implement.


D.  Key Personnel - Project Director

      imperatives
      5) Identify and access seasoned professionals with extensive knowledge of evidence base and best practices across the 8 focus areas
      6) Review and critique technical documents (including slide presentations) to ensure they conform to evidence base
      7) Summarize essence of technical material such that it is readily understandable by lay audience
      8) Understand research such rigorous findings can be discerned from less rigorous findings
      9) Use a range of communication venues and management techniques to lead a successful and dynamic Learning Network
      10) Evaluate program success on an ongoing basis, and continuously improve.

      4.  Evidence of qualifications and formal education, which should include at a minimum relevant graduate-level training, e.g., in field of
      medicine and/or public health, and 10 years’ experience managing projects of similar size and nature.

L.11  PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION


      Offerors shall submit the following information (original and 3 copies) as part of their proposal for both the offeror and proposed major
      subcontractors:


      (1)   A list of the last five (5) contracts and subcontracts completed (most relevant or most related) during the past three years and all
      contracts and subcontracts currently in process.  Reference contracts and subcontracts completed during the past three years and include
      recently completed and ongoing work directly related to the requirements of this acquisition. Contracts listed may include those entered
      into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments and commercial customers.  Offerors that are newly formed entities
      without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required for all key personnel.  Include the following information for
      each contract and subcontract:
                       a: Name of contracting activity

      (2)   The offeror should provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified in (1) above and
      corrective actions taken to resolve those problems.  Offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified
      contracts.  General performance information will be obtained from the references.


      (3)   The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that may indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for
      developing and producing the product or service required.  Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that
      received the award or certification.  Describe when the award or certification was bestowed.  If the award or certification is over three
      years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply.


      (4)   Each offeror will be evaluated on his/her performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services.
      Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offeror’s relative
      rankings will be compared to assure best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of
      performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  References other than those identified by the
      offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received used in the evaluation of the offeror’s past performance.

      (5)   The offeror must provide related past performance of the proposed Project Director.   Reference contracts and subcontracts completed
      during the past three years and include recently completed and ongoing work directly related to the requirements of this acquisition.


      The attached Past Performance Questionnaire and Contractor Performance Form shall be completed by those organizations listed in (1) above.
      The evaluation forms shall be completed and forwarded directly to:


                             Jessica Alderton
                             Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
                             Division of Contracts Management
                             540 Gaither Road
                             Rockville, Maryland 20850
                             FAX: 301-427-1740


      Evaluation forms must be received by the date and time listed in order to be included in the review process.  It is the responsibility of
      the offeror to ensure that these documents are forwarded to the Contracting Officer.


   L.12     SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN:


      In accordance with FAR Part 15.304(c)4, the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns in performance of the
      contract shall be evaluated in unrestricted acquisitions expected to exceed a total estimated cost of $550,000 ($1,000,000 for
      construction) subject to certain limitations (see FAR 19.201 and 19.1202).


      A.    All offerors, regardless of size, shall submit the following information in original and 2 copies.

            A plan on the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business concerns in performance of the contract.  Participation in
           performance of the contract includes the work expected to be performed by SDB concern(s).  This can include SDB (as prime
           contractor), joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and subcontracts.  Include the following information in SDB participation plans:


                 1.    The extent of an offeror’s commitment to use SDB concerns.  Commitment should be as specific as possible, i.e., are
                       subcontract arrangements already in place, letters of commitment, etc.  Enforceable commitments will be weighted more
                       heavily than non-enforceable ones.

                 2.    Specifically identify the SDB concerns with point of contact and phone number.

                 3.    The complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform.

                 4.    Realism for the use of SDB in the proposal.

                 5.    Past performance of the Offeror in complying with subcontracting plans for SDB concerns.

                 6.    Targets expressed as dollars and percentage of total contract value for each participating SDB; which will be
                       incorporated into and become part of any resulting contract.

                 7.    The extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the total acquisition.


      B.    SDB participation information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which
           offeror’s relative rankings will be compared to assure the best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information
           that demonstrates realistic commitments to use SDB concerns relative to the size and complexity of the acquisition under

L.13  BUSINESS PROPOSAL


      The offeror shall submit as part of the proposal a separate enclosure titled “Business Proposal.”  The Business Proposal shall include the
      Cost/Price Proposal, the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, and Other Administrative Data in accordance with the following:


      A.    Cost/Price Proposal

            A cost proposal shall be submitted in accordance with FAR 15, in a format similar to the attachment.  The offeror’s own format may
      be utilized, but all required information in the attachment shall be provided.

            The business proposal must contain sufficient information to allow the Government to perform a basic analysis of the proposed cost
      or price of the work.  This information shall include the amounts of the basic elements of the proposed cost or price.

            As appropriate, cost breakdowns shall be provided for the following cost elements.

            (a)  Direct Labor
      The estimated cost for all personnel who will be assigned for direct work on this project shall be included.  Give the name, title, percent
      of effort or time, salary and fringe benefits for each employee.
      Salary increases that are anticipated during performance of a resultant contract should be proposed as a cost.  If escalation is included,
      state the degree (percent) and methodology, e.g., annual flat rate applied to a base rate as of a specific date or a mid-pointed rate for
      the period of performance.  State whether any additional direct labor (new hires) will be required during the performance period of this
      procurement.  If so, state the number required and anticipated date of hire.  Also, specify the month and day on which your fiscal year
      commences.

            (b)  Supplies and Equipment
      Include description, unit price, quantity, total price, justification for purchasing or leasing items and the basis for pricing (vendor
      quotes, invoices prices, etc.).


      (c)   Travel
      The amount proposed for travel shall be supported with a breakdown which includes purposes, destination, duration, and estimated cost
      (transportation and per diem) for each proposed trip.  If travel costs are proposed on the basis of your organization’s established travel
      policy, a copy of the policy must be provided.


      (d)   Consultants
      This element should include name(s) of consultant, number of days, and daily rate.  The method of obtaining each consultant, either sole
      source or competitive, and the degree of competition or the rationale for sole source shall be explained.


      (e)   Subcontractors
      Subcontractor costs shall be broken down and supported by cost and pricing data adequate to establish the reasonableness of the proposed
      amount.  Subcontract cost detail should be similar to the level of detail provided for the prime contractor, with the same cost elements.
      Support documentation should include degree of subcontract competition and basis for selecting source.


      (f)   Other Direct Costs
      Any proposed other direct costs shall be supported with breakdown outlining the separate costs proposed and details supporting the
      formulation of the costs proposed.  A signed agreement between the offeror and any personnel other than direct employees that includes
      dates of employment, salary, and specific tasks to be performed should be included.


      (g)   Indirect Costs
      Indicate how you have computed and applied indirect costs, and provide a basis for evaluating the reasonableness of the proposed rates.

B.    Cost Analysis

      In order for AHRQ to conduct a complete cost analysis please include the following information in the cost proposal:

     • Copy of most recent payroll register for ALL proposed employees.  If necessary, show proposed hourly rate calculations for each employee.


     • Copy of most current indirect cost rate agreement.  If no rate agreement exists, show detailed calculations of all proposed indirect
       rates, supported by audited or reviewed financial statements.

     • Detailed breakdown of each proposed direct cost element by contract year (not by task only), showing proposed total quantities per year
       and corresponding proposed unit costs for each item.

     • Supporting documentation for each proposed unit cost.  Examples of accepted forms of documentation include invoices, catalog pages,
       quotations, and general ledgers showing historical costs for comparable items.

     • State salary increase policy, as well as proposed increase factor.  If it is company policy for employees to receive salary increases on
       their anniversary dates of hire, please indicate the anniversary dates of hire for each proposed employee.

     • Breakdown of proposed unloaded direct labor rates and proposed number of direct labor hours for each employee for each contract year.

     • State the proposed period of performance that proposed costs are based upon.


C.          Small Business Subcontracting Plan:
           All offerors except small businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with the Small Business
           Subcontracting Plan, FAR 52.219-9, incorporated in this solicitation. A copy of a model subcontracting plan is available at
           http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/read/SampleSubcontractingPlan.doc.  If the model plan is not used, all elements outlined must be addressed
           in the offeror’s format.  If the offeror is not a small business and fails to submit a subcontracting plan with the initial proposal,
           the offeror will be considered nonresponsive and their proposal will be returned without further consideration.

           This provision does not apply to small business concerns.  This provision does apply to all other offerors, including large business
           concerns, colleges, universities and non-profit organizations.

            The term “subcontract” means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal
           Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract
           or subcontract.  This includes, but is not limited to, agreements/ purchase orders for supplies and services such as equipment
           purchase, copying services, and travel services.

            The offeror understands that:

              a. No contract will be awarded unless and until an acceptable plan is negotiated with the Contracting Officer. The plan will be
                 incorporated in to the contract.

              b. An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting officer, provide the maximum practicable opportunity for small
                 business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to
                 participate in the performance of the contract.

              c. If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the
                 contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror,
                 the offeror shall be ineligible for award.  The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for
                 determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the
                 plan within the time limits prescribed.

              d. Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the
                 Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.

              e. It is the offeror’s responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to small business concerns and
                 small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned small
                 business concerns, and that each such aspect of the offeror’s plan will be judged independent of the other.

              f. The offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions
                 thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer.  Subcontractors will also submit these reports to the Government
                 Contracting Officer or as otherwise directed, with a copy to the prime Contractor’s designated small and disadvantaged business
                 liaison.


              g. For this particular acquisition, the AHRQ recommended goal (as a percentage of total contract value for the base period) is 20%
                 for Small Businesses,  which shall include at least 5.5% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base
                 period) for Small Disadvantaged Businesses, at least 5% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base
                 period) for Women-Owned Small Businesses, and at least 3% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base
                 period) for HUBZone Small Businesses and at least 3% (as a percentage of total planned subcontract dollars for the base period)
                 for Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  These goals represent AHRQ’s expectations of the minimum level for subcontracting with
                 small business at the prime contract level.  Any goal stated less than the AHRQ recommended goal shall be justified and is
                 subject to negotiation.

L.14  SELECTION OF OFFERORS


      a.    The acceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee.  The
      committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation criteria of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written
      critiques.  The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror.


      b.    The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a limited cost review, management analysis, etc.


      c.    Past performance of the technically acceptable offerors will be evaluated by AHRQ staff.  A competitive range will be determined.
      The competitive range will consist of those offers which are highly rated, based upon the technical and past performance evaluation.
      Written discussions will be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range, if necessary.  In addition, offerors within the
      competitive range may be required to give an oral presentation to AHRQ contracts and program staff.  Details on the information the
      presentation must contain will be provided to those offerors prior to the presentation.  A cost analysis will be performed by AHRQ’s Cost
      Analyst.  All aspects of the proposals are subject to discussions, including cost, technical approach, past performance, and contractual
      terms and conditions. Final Proposal Revisions may be requested with the reservation of the right to conduct limited negotiations after
      submission of Final Proposal Revisions.


      d.    A final best-value analysis will be performed taking into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, cost analysis, past
      performance, and ability to complete the work within the Government’s required schedule.  The Government reserves the right to make an
      award to the best advantage of the Government, technical merit, cost, past performance, and other factors considered.


      e.    The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP.
            SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against the evaluation criteria and award will be made to
that responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government.  Evaluation Criteria 1 through 4 will be evaluated by a peer
review technical committee that will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal.  Offerors that submit
technically acceptable proposals will then be evaluated for past performance and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan.  Following
these evaluations a competitive range will be determined.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost/price may
become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the
evaluation of all factors other than cost or price. While the scientific technical merit of the proposals will receive paramount consideration
in the selection of the Contractor for this acquisition, the Government may also consider other factors in source selection.

 In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the
Government. The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all.

THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR NEGOTIATIONS.

The Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government.
The evaluation factors and assigned weights which will be used in the overall review of the offeror’s proposal are outlined below.  The
technical proposal shall consist of the responses to evaluation criteria 1 through 4 (including subcriteria).  The offeror should show that the
objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement.  The following criteria will be used to
evaluate proposals and will be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all proposals submitted.  Factors facilitating the
evaluation of each criterion below are referenced in the corresponding criteria found in Section L of this solicitation.

OFFERORS PLEASE NOTE: Evaluation Criteria 1 through 4, for a total of 100 points, will be evaluated by a peer review technical committee that
will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal.  Program staff and contracting personnel will review and
evaluate Criteria 5 and 6 for a total of 50 points.  The total possible points for Evaluation Criteria 1 through 6 is 150 points.

Evaluation Criteria    Weight


1.  Technical Approach                                        25

TOTAL POINTS BEFORE PAST PERFORMANCE         100


5.    Past Performance                                        45


      Offerors will be evaluated on all past performance for the Organization and the Project Director (see Section L.11). Completed
      questionnaires will also provide a basis for determining past performance evaluation as well as information obtained from the references
      listed in the proposal, other customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and any others who may have useful and
      relevant information.  Information will also be considered regarding any significant subcontractors and key personnel records.






      The offerors past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the following factors:

           a.    Quality
                 How well has the offeror conformed to the performance standard in providing the services or achieving the stated objective(s) of
                 contracts or grants? Quality will be evaluated by the personnel provided, the level of effort agreed to in the contract
                 statement of work or grant, quality of final products (e.g., findings, tools), implementation activities, dissemination and
                 activities that promote turning research into action (i.e. promoting uptake of innovation).

           b.    Timeliness
                 How well has the offeror adhered to timetables and delivery schedules in providing the required services or products?
                 Consideration is given to the offeror’s efforts to recommend and/or take corrective actions to keep work on schedule.

           c.    Business Relations/ Customer satisfaction
                 The offeror will be rated on professional and cooperative behavior with the client.

              d. Cost control
                 The offeror will be rated on the ability to set reasonable budgets within contracting or grant guidelines and adhere to them in
                 conducting research.

      Assessment of the offeror(s past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the offeror(s proposal, and relative
      capability to meet performance requirements.

      Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not
      be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently
      demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services and quality products at fair and reasonable prices.


      The assessment of the offeror(s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and the other
      competitors.  Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose
      record is acceptable, even though both may have acceptable technical proposals.


      By past performance, the Government means the offeror(s record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the
      offeror’s record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror(s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects
      of performance; the offeror(s reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally,
      the offeror(s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.


      The Government will consider the number or severity of an offeror(s problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offeror(s
      overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.


      If the offeror or the proposed employees for the offeror, do not have a past performance history relative to this acquisition, or past
      performance not relative to this acquisition, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor.  A neutral rating
      will be determined.


      The Government reserves the right to evaluate relevant past performance information not specifically provided by the offeror.


      In evaluating past performance the Government, will consider the offeror’s effectiveness in quality of products or services; timeliness of
      performance; cost control; business practices; customer satisfaction, and key personnel past performance.


      NOTICE:  Past Performance questionnaires are to be provided to the Contracts Office NO LATER than the closing date and time for receipt of
      proposals.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to ensure that these documents are forwarded to Jessica Alderton by email:
      jessica.alderton@ahrq.hhs.gov.

6.    Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan               5

      The evaluation will be abased on information obtained from the plan provided by the offeror, the realism of the proposal and other
      relevant information obtained from the named SDB concerns, and any other information supplies by the offeror concerning problems
      encountered in SDB participation.

      Evaluation of the SDB Participation Plan will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.
      It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance. The government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has
      demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform as the prime contractor.

      The assessment of the offeror’s SDB Participating Plan will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capacity and commitment of the
      offeror and the other competitors. Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of participation with SDB concerns may receive more points
      and a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable , even though both may have acceptable technical proposals SDB
      participation will be scored with offerors receiving points from 0 to 5, with 5 being the most favorable. .

      requirements of this solicitation.  For example, this solicitation may require the submission of cost/price data for three years listed on
      this form.  (See Section L, Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors, for the estimated duration of this project.)  If this
      solicitation is phased, identify each phase in addition to each year.  Total each year, phase, and sub-element.

3.    This format must be used to submit the breakdown of all proposed estimated cost elements. List each cost element and sub-element for
      direct costs, indirect costs and fee, if applicable. In addition, provide detailed calculations for all items. For example:

   a.  For all personnel, list the name, title, rate per hour and number of hours proposed. If a pool of personnel is proposed, list the
   composition of the pool and how the cost proposed was calculated. List the factor used for prorating Year One and the escalation rate applied
   between years.


   Offeror's proposal should be stated in the same terms as will be used to account for and record direct labor under a contract (i.e. percentage
   of effort is used for most faculty and professional employees at educational institutions).  If percentages of effort are used, the basis to
   which such percentages are applied must also be submitted by the offeror.  The attached format should be revised to accommodate direct labor
   proposed as a percentage of effort.

   b.  For all materials, supplies, and other direct costs, list all unit prices, etc., to detail how the calculations were made.


   c.  For all indirect costs, list the rates applied and the base the rate is applied to.


   d.  For all travel, list the specifics for each trip.


   e.  For any subcontract proposed, submit a separate breakdown format.


   f.  Justification for the need of some cost elements may be listed as an attachment, i.e., special equipment, above average consultant fees,
   etc.

4.    If the Government has provided "uniform pricing assumptions" for this solicitation, the offeror must comply with and identify each item.

AHRQ Sampler #1
Hospital Data Resources and Tools for CVEs   CONCOURSE LEVEL – Military Room

All of the new CVEs reside in a state with a statewide hospital database, and 10 of the 11 are in states that partner with AHRQ’s HCUP program
to standardize the databases across states.  Anne Elixhauser will provide an overview of state health care data resources (covering hospital,
emergency department (ED), and ambulatory surgery care), HCUPnet (an interactive tool for identifying and comparing hospital and ED statistics
at the national and state levels), the Preventable Hospitalization Costs Mapping Tool and the hospital Quality Indicators software.    Dr.
Elixhauser also will preview a new tool in development, tentatively called “Input Data – Output Website.”  This family of AHRQ tools can address
CVE questions such as:
    • How does your state compare with other states, and the nation, in terms of – How many CABGs were performed? What is the trend in
      hospitalizations for MRSA? What is the cost of C-section versus vaginal deliveries?
    • What are the rates of hospitalization – available by county – in your CVE for a range of “preventable admissions,” and what savings might
      be achieved from a reduction in these admissions?
    • At a national level – What are national benchmarks on quality measures such as in-hospital mortality for specific procedures and conditions
      and patient safety indicators?
    • How prevalent are preventable admissions, and how much to they cost the health care system?

Speaker: Anne Elixhauser

Pay for Performance – Latest Evidence from AHRQ    CONCOURSE LEVEL – International Ballroom West

Pay-for-performance (P4P) programs are designed to offer financial incentives to health care providers to meet defined quality, efficiency, or
other targets.  There are many decisions that go into the design of a P4P program, and each decision affects the likelihood that a program will
achieve its goals.  Two AHRQ-supported researchers, Adams Dudley and Meredith Rosenthal, will present their portfolio of P4P research and tools.
 Dr. Dudley and Dr. Rosenthal will review questions that private and public purchasers and health plans face in considering pay for performance,
review options and any available evidence—from empirical evaluations and economic theory—that informs decision making.  This session will
address:
    • What do we know about physician interest in pay for performance?
    • For physician pay for performance, should we target group practices or individual physicians?
    • For incentives that target physician practices, how are incentives passed along to individual physicians?
    • What is the role of executives in achieving successful pay-for-performance programs?
    • Is there any special advice for Medicaid agencies and Medicaid managed care plans interested in pay for performance?
    • Should provider participation be voluntary or mandatory?
    • Should we use carrots or sticks—bonuses or penalties—or a combination?
    • How should the bonus be structured?
    • Should we use relative or absolute performance thresholds?
    • What are our options for phasing in pay for performance?
    • Where do we find the money?
    • How much money should we put into performance pay?
    • What measure characteristics make them attractive candidates for inclusion in an initial measure set?
Speakers: Adams Dudley, Meredith Rosenthal

models as well as CVE value models and governance models, based on her case studies and pilot projects with 5 CVEs.  How does your CVE’s funding
model compare with other collaboratives?  Dr. Clancy will review the goals of the AHRQ CVE Sustainability Workgroup, which was convened in
August 2008 to identify CVE conditions or attributes that have potential to enhance individual CVE sustainability and to explore potential
models for an umbrella entity that might play a role in enhancing individual CVE sustainability.  A member of the CVE Sustainability Workgroup,
will preview interim analyses and actively seek feedback from the broader group of CVE stakeholders.   Bring your questions about funding
strategies, value propositions and governance, and share your experiences!
