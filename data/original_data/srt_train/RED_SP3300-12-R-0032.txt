FAR 52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (SEP 2006) (a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from Joni L. Stephens, DLA Distribution Acquisitions, 2001 Mission Dr, Bldg 404, New Cumberland PA 17070. (b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO. (End of Provision) FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1: Technical Factor 2: Past Performance Factor 3: Price The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, inclusive of options, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and which has submitted a proposal conforming to the solicitation requirements. The requirements include all stated terms, conditions, completion of representations and certifications, and all other requirements of this solicitation. The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. Offerors are advised that unrealistically low price, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the offeror does not understand this requirement. Proposals shall be evaluated for acceptability or unacceptability only and shall not be rated. Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the nonprice factors. Any offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable proposal and who has been found to have an acceptable or neutral past performance will then have the proposal evaluated for lowest price. The following non-price factors shall be used to determine acceptability of a proposal: Factor 1: Technical Capability Factor 2: Past Performance Factors 1 through 2 shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. To be considered acceptable and eligible for award, an Offeror must address separately all the factors set forth in accordance with the instructions of this solicitation. A major item and/or gross omission which precludes meeting solicitation objectives which cannot be corrected prior to or during discussions without major revision or complete resubmission of the proposal will cause a proposal to be found technically unacceptable.

The determination of the competitive range will include all proposals which are considered to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award. A proposal is considered acceptable if it (i) addresses itself to all the essential requirements of the RFP, (ii) shows the offeror understands all essential requirements of the RFP, and has demonstrated a full capability to perform the prospective requirements, (iii) offers a feasible technical approach, (iv) is determined to have an adequate accounting system, and (v) although some discussion of the proposal may be desirable, the proposal is complete to the extent that an award could be made on its present terms. A proposal will be considered unacceptable if award cannot be made on the present terms of the proposal, and corrective action would require essentially rewriting the proposal or require the submission of an approach which would be new or almost entirely different from that previously proposed. An "Unacceptable" rating on Technical Evaluation Factors 1 shall render the proposal ineligible for award, or if discussions are held, a proposal found to be "unacceptable for award" (as defined above) may be excluded from the competitive range. An initial proposal evaluation of "Unacceptable" in the Past Performance Factor (Factor 2) will not automatically eliminate an offeror from the competitive range, but may be considered in making the competitive range determination if communications have been conducted pursuant to FAR 15.306(b)(1)(i). Communications shall be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor keeping them from being placed within the competitive range if the communications are necessary to allow them to address adverse past performance information to which the offeror(s) had not had a prior opportunity to respond. It is the intention of the Government to award without discussions. However, if it is determined that discussions are required, then the determination of the competitive range will include all proposals which are considered to be technically acceptable and may include those that are considered to have a reasonable chance of being selected for award, unless the competitive range is further limited in accordance with FAR 15.306(c)(2). Those offerors whose proposals do not fall into the competitive range will be notified as required by FAR 15.503(a)(1). Offerors will be notified in writing with a concise explanation of their proposal deficiencies without jeopardizing the competitive range. Those offerors whose proposals are determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the competitive range will be contacted by the Contract Specialist for discussions. Discussions will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306(d). If verbal discussions are held they will be followed by a written reiteration of the discussion. Written discussions may also be held, whereby the Government will provide a written list of discussion questions to each offeror, as appropriate. In the case of both verbal and written discussions, the offeror will provide a written response to the discussion question and revision to the proposal as required. This response and revision (if required) will be marked accordingly to distinguish it as a supplement to their original proposal. More than one round of discussions may be held. At the conclusion of final discussions, the Government will request each offeror in the competitive range to submit a Final Proposal Revision (FPR). The FPR will be evaluated as to its revised technical, past performance, and/or pricing approach in response to the issues identified during discussions. The Government then intends, in accordance with the evaluation factors for award set forth below, to award a contract to the offeror who has submitted the lowest price technically acceptable proposal. A proposal will be determined ineligible for award if Factor 1 through Factor 2 is/are evaluated as "Unacceptable". Factor 1 ­ Technical Capability

The Offeror's Technical Capability will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. To be technically acceptable, the Offeror shall demonstrate a clear understanding of the work required and a reasonable, wellthought-out approach that is likely to yield the necessary performance within the required time frame.

Factor 2 - Past Performance The Government may utilize the Federal Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), data submitted by the offeror in Volume III, and any other information available to determine the quality and relevance of the offeror's past performance. Each proposal will be evaluated to the extent to which the offeror has demonstrated an ability and willingness to perform: 1) A quality product or service (i.e. the conformance to contract requirements, specifications, and standards of good worksmanship); 2) Timeliness of the contract with regard to completion of contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules and administrative requirements (e.g. effort that contributes to or affects the schedule variance); 3) Acceptable cost control with regard to the offeror's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract cost; 4) Good business relationships with regard to the timeliness completeness and quality of problem identification and resolution, offeror's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts, and whether the contractor met their small/small disadvantaged and women owned business participation goals; and 5) Management of key personnel with regard to demonstration of a commitment to the management of key personnel with regard to the offeror's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. The Government will only consider relevant past performance data the offeror and its major subcontractors. A major subcontractor is defined as those providing twenty percent (20%) of the total threshold AND/OR twentyfive percent (25%) of total man-hour effort. Subcontractors not meeting the definition of a "major subcontractor" will not be evaluated. To be considered relevant, the offeror must demonstrate past execution of similar contracts in terms of complexity, technology, magnitude of effort, schedule, and scope. Additionally, the performance must have occurred during the last five (5) years. Offerors shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), Past Performance Evaluation). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." Should the Government discover adverse past performance information to which the offeor(s) had not had a prior opportunity to respond, the PCO will conduct communications if deemed appropriate. Price Proposals determined to meet or exceed the acceptability standards for the non-cost evaluation factors then will be evaluated for the lowest price. Price reasonableness will be determined through price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.402. The Government will utilize a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally, adequate price competition establishes price reasonableness (see FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)). In addition, the Government may utilize a comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government historical and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items, if both the validity of the comparison and the reasonableness of the previous price(s) can be established.

Award will be based on the lowest priced proposal that meets or exceeds the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Present/Past Performance Questionnaire REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL: SP3300-12-R-0032
The RFP has been issued to determine the most efficient and cost effective provider for this procurement. The place of performance for contract is DLA Distribution HQ located in New Cumberland, PA.

The Requirements covered under this acquisition include acquiring and installing new video teleconference equipment, removal of existing equipment, and a maintenance plan to include preventative maintenance for five conferences rooms located in four different buildings at the DLA Distribution HQ in New Cumberland, PA. Questionnaire Instructions The questionnaire covers the topics that are in line with the Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPARs). This questionnaire is designed to provide basic information regarding the Contractor's past performance results on the contracts they have been awarded and your satisfaction with their performance. The format of the questionnaire follows a five-point scale with five being Exceptional and 1 being Unsatisfactory. RATERS PLEASE NOTE: Per DOD policy, a fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractors will not be assessed a lower than Satisfactory rating solely for not performing beyond the requirement of the contract. Please use the following guide in preparing your response to the below questions: Dark Blue/Exceptional ­ RATING OF 5 Definition: Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. NOTE: To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were a benefit to the Government. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it alone constitutes an Exceptional rating. Also there should have been NO significant weaknesses identified.

Purple/Very Good ­ RATING OF 4 Definition: Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor was effective. NOTE: To justify a Very Good rating, identify a significant event and state how it was a benefit to the Government. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified. Green/Satisfactory ­ RATING OF 3 Definition: Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear to be or were satisfactory.

Attachment 3: Paste Performance Questionaire

Page 2 of 4

NOTE: To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor recovered from without impact to the contract. There should have been NO significant weaknesses identified. Yellow/Marginal ­ RATING OF 2 Definition: Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. NOTE: To justify Marginal performance, identify a significant event in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government. A Marginal rating should be supported by referencing the management tool that notified the contractor of the contractual deficiency (e.g. management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency report or letter). Red/Unsatisfactory ­ RATING OF 1 Definition: Performance does not meet MOST contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective. NOTE: To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government. A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the management tools used to notify the contractor of the contractual deficiencies (e.g., management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency reports, or letters). How would you rate this contractor past performance using the following number scale, please ensure that you use the definitions above when assigning a numerical rating. In addition, please provide a justification for rating given if above or below satisfactory.
