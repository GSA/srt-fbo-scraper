CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.217-8     OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)

The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  These rates may

written notice to the Contractor within 15 days prior to contract expiration date.

(End of clause)



52.217-9     OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)

(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 15 days; provided that the Government gives
the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does
not commit the Government to an extension.

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.

(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 28 Feb 2015.
 (End of clause)



52.219-6     NOTICE OF TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE (NOV 2011)

(a) Definition.

"Small business concern," as used in this clause, means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not
dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the size standards in
this solicitation.

(b) Applicability. This clause applies only to--

(1) Contracts that have been totally set aside or reserved for small business concerns; and

(2) Orders set aside for small business concerns under multiple-award contracts as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F).

(c) General. (1) Offers are solicited only from small business concerns. Offers received from concerns that are not small business concerns

52.219-28    POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2009)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that
exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the
clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of
operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling
or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In
determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of
employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements,
facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the
novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that
corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause
by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central
Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting
office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the
date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is
not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code
applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office,
along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code      - assigned to contract number      .

(Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title).

(End of clause)




52.232-18     AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)

Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of
appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may
arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability,
to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

(End of clause)



52.252-2      CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)
