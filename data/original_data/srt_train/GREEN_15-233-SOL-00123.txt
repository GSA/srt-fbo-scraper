C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS C.1 BACKGROUND The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of l981, as amended, and is administered within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In HHS, LIHEAP is administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The purpose of LIHEAP is to provide grants to states, territories, Indian tribes and tribal organizations to assist low income households in meeting the costs of residential energy. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of l981 (Title XXVI of Public Law 97-35, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 8621) in section 2609A(a) authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to set aside up to $300,000 each fiscal year to make grants or contracts, to state and public agencies and private non-profit organizations, to provide training and technical assistance relating to LIHEAP. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, overrode P.L. 97-35 and allowed the Secretary (1) to set aside up to $2,988,000; and (2) enter into contracts with private entities that do not qualify as nonprofit organizations. Jointly financed cooperative arrangements may be made with states and public agencies and private nonprofit organizations. In addition, section 2609A(b) of P.L. 97-35 also authorized grants "to one or more private nonprofit organizations that apply jointly with a business concern to receive such grant." This request is also being submitted under the authority of Section 601 of the Economy Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. Sections 1535 and 1536), and Section 1110 of the Social Security Act. LIHEAP allows states, tribes and territories to develop energy assistance and weatherization programs that best meet the needs of their low income populations. Consequently, LIHEAP programs vary greatly in program design and implementation strategies. It is important for LIHEAP grantees to share their unique programs and innovative ideas so successful and effective policies and practices can be replicated to enhance programs. It is also important for grantees to have access to evaluations and research to help them administer effective programs. C.2. SCOPE AND REQUIRMENTS The purpose of this contract is to create a LIHEAP Clearinghouse which shall be responsible to collect, develop, organize and disseminate information on LIHEAP programs, current energy issues and trends, other low income energy assistance programs, other programs that affect LIHEAP-eligible clients and other relevant information of interest to LIHEAP grantees. The Clearinghouse will provide technical assistance and information through a dedicated telephone number, a website, a mailing address, electronic newsletters and other written correspondence as needed. Clearinghouse information will be available to OCS, LIHEAP grantees, their sub-contractors and sub-grantees, including other OCS grantees such as Community Actions Agencies, and other interested parties. The Clearinghouse will also provide a National Energy Assistance Referral (NEAR) Service that refers those in the general public who are interested in applying for LIHEAP to the LIHEAP office or other assistance agencies, as appropriate. The Clearinghouse staff may also be asked to provide technical assistance and training presentations, as needed. The LIHEAP Clearinghouse serves as a hub for information about the variation among LIHEAP grantees in their programs policies and procedures. It is also a referral network for the public to access information 24/7 about where to apply for assistance.

L.3.1 HHSAR 352.239-73(A) ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (JANUARY 2010) (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any federal department or agency permit(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and (2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. (b) Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm. (c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, Quoters must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to selfevaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website (http://www.hhs.gov/od/). (d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance Page 41 of 49

specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense. L. 4 PAST PERFORMANCE QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS Quoters will be evaluated on past performance under existing contracts and on prior contracts. Quoters should note the difference between past performance and past experience. Past performance relates to quality and how well a contractor performed, while past experience is about the type and amount of work previously performed by a contractor. The quoter shall provide a maximum of three (3) performance references for contracts within the past 3 years. The offeror shall provide a write-up for each reference that includes the following: Several points of contact (Contracting Officer, Contracting Officers' Representative and any other pertinent officials that can verify performance) - name, agency/company, address, phone number and email address Contract title Contract number (and task order number when applicable) Contract value Project description and size information Relevancy to the statement of work for the subject solicitation Provide an explanation of problems, delays, cost overruns and corrective actions taken. Past performance information shall be provided for predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Past performance information is proprietary source selection information. The Government will only discuss past performance information directly with the prospective prime or sub-contractor that is being reviewed. If there is a problem with the proposed subcontractor's past performance, the prime can be notified of a problem, but no details, may be discussed without the subcontractor's permission. The contractor shall ensure that the Past Performance Questionnaires (Attachment D) are completed by at least three separate customers and returned to this office no later than 3:00 PM EST, Friday, March 13, 2015. Questionnaires shall be submitted via e-mail to Arielle.Douglas@psc.hhs.gov

L.5 BUSINESS QUOTE INSTRUCTIONS Quoters, at a minimum, shall submit price quotes in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that the proposed price is realistic and consistent with the proposed technical approach. The quoter's quote must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that is firm for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt by the Government. Quoters shall also include a completed FAR 52.213-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications ­ Commercial Items (Nov 2013) (Attachment C) and the representation at 11.5.1. below:

M: EVLAUTION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1 GENERAL In order for quotes to be considered acceptable and eligible for evaluation, they must be prepared in accordance with and in compliance with the instructions given in this RFQ and address all of the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work/Description of Requirement. Quotes which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government's scope of work will not be eligible for an award.

M.1.1 BASIS FOR AWARD The following factors will be considered in evaluating quotes: - Technical; - Price; - Past Performance Award will be made to that responsible Quoter whose quote contains the combination of those factors offering the best overall value to the Government. This will be determined by comparing differences in technical merit and past performance with differences in price to the Government. In making this comparison the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical merit and past performance. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical merit and past performance. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced Quoter or to the Quoter with a higher technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. M.2 AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Quoter. Therefore, the Quoter's initial proposal should contain the Quoter's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary

M.3 TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA The criteria identified below will serve as the standard against which the technical quote will be evaluated and identifies the significant factors which the Quoter should address in their quotes. The evaluation of the Quoter's quote shall be based upon the completeness and thoroughness of the quote submitted. The following criteria will be used to technically evaluate quotes and shall be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating (maximum of 100 points obtainable) for all technical quotes submitted: The factors on the following pages will be used to technically evaluate quotes and will be weighted as indicated in establishing a numerical rating for all technical quotes submitted: Factor 1- Understanding of Project Factor 2 ­ Soundness of Approach and Schedule Factor 3 ­ Personnel Factor 4 ­ Capability, Responsibility, and Previous Experience on Similar Projects Factor 4 - Section 508 Compliance = 5 Points = 30 Points = 25 Points = 40 Points = Acceptable/Unacceptable

FACTOR 1 - Understanding of Project (5 Points) The respondent's proposal provides a comprehensive statement of the scope and objectives of the project to demonstrate respondent's complete understanding of the intent and requirements of the project. This understanding indicates a clear awareness of each task, the problems to be encountered in its accomplishment, and strategies for mitigating problems. FACTOR 2 - Soundness of Approach and Schedule (30 Points) The respondent's proposal describes the proposed approach to comply with each of the requirements that the respondent will be responsible for performing as specified in the Statement of Work. The proposal is consistent with the stated project goals and objectives. The proposed approach of assuring the achievement of timely and acceptable performance is feasible and reasonable. The proposal demonstrates that the respondent is willing and able to commit its resources to fulfilling the requirements of the Statement of Work. The respondent proposes realistic timeframes (by milestones or phasing chart) and identifies the chronological sequence by which key activities will occur in order to accomplish each task that the respondent will be responsible for performing. FACTOR 3 - Personnel (25 Points) Information is provided as to which key personnel will be assigned or committed to the project. The percentage of time each staff member will contribute to the project is adequately identified. The extent to which outside subcontractors, consultants or specialists will be used and for what tasks are specified and evidence of their availability for the project is provided. A current resume is provided for each employee that the respondent proposes to assign or commit to the project. The key personnel (and subcontractors, consultants or specialists, if applicable) to be assigned to the project are competent and experienced in the skills required to perform the requirements of the Statement of Work. The key staff possesses not only academic qualifications but also experience in similar tasks and clearly relevant training and experience. Proposed staff must have demonstrated experience providing technical assistance to state, tribal, and territory and local home energy assistance programs.

FACTOR 4 - Capability, Responsibility, and Previous Experience on Similar Projects (40 Points) The respondent demonstrates sufficient breadth and depth of management capability for accomplishing the project. The respondent demonstrates previous management or organizational experience in performing work similar to that outlined in the Statement of Work, experience providing a substantial understanding and background of LIHEAP and low-income energy issues, and experience in operating a clearinghouse of federal assistance program information in the last 5 years. The respondent organization must demonstrate experience within the last 5 years in providing technical assistance to state, tribal, territory and local home energy assistance programs. The respondent demonstrates that it has available computer equipment, telephone modem, and communication software to access the Internet and provide a website.

FACTOR 5 - Section 508 Compliance (Acceptable/Unacceptable) The offeror must demonstrate their compliance with the applicable Section 508 standards. This includes submitting the completed HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template (Attachment B), Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm In order to be evaluated as "Acceptable", the offeror must complete the HHS 508 Evaluation Template, the technical proposal must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards and the technical proposal must include a binding statement of conformance to the established EIT accessibility standards. No points are assigned to this evaluation criteria and it will be evaluated as Acceptable or Unacceptable M.3 PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION Past performance information is one indicator of a quoter's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. This evaluation is subjective and will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Quoter (for themselves, predecessor companies, key personnel, and major subcontractors), as well as information obtained by other sources known to the Government. For the purpose of this evaluation the term "quoter" is inclusive of the prime, predecessor companies, key personnel and subcontractors for which past performance will be evaluated. Relevancy Relevancy will be evaluated based on the size, scope and complexity of the quoter's past performance and how it compares to the services specified in Section C of this RFQ. As the relevancy of past performance increases the significance of the reference also increases. Performance Ratings The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations. Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes. To determine how well the quoter has performed in the past, the Government is using past performance rating information available in PPIRS as well as information provided through questionnaires and direct communication with references.

Solicitation No. 15-233-SOL-00123 Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) Clearinghouse

The following performance areas will be rated: Quality of Product/Service - Contractor's conformance to contract/order requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). Schedule - The timeliness of the contractor against the competition of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). Cost Control (Not required for Firm Fixed Price or Firm Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment) Contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract/order cost. Business Relations - Integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract/order, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, quote submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts. Management of Key Personnel (Applicable when the contract/order contains a Key Personnel clause) Contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel.

Utilization of Small Business - Whether the contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Businesses to participate in contract/order performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract/order. Including compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract/order relating to Small Business participation, small business participation goals, and AbilityOne goals (when required). Other Areas - Additional evaluation areas that are unique to the contract/order or that could not be captured elsewhere. References are able to rate other areas that are unique to the contract or that cannot be captured elsewhere by adding a field to the CPARS evaluation that transmits to PPIRS or to the past performance questionnaire. All information provided will be taken into consideration when evaluating an quoter's past performance. The rating scheme for how well an quoter has performed is identical to the rating scheme used by evaluators in CPARS.

PERFORMANCE RATING EVALUATION SCHEME: Rating Exceptional Definition Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. Page 47 of 49

Solicitation No. 15-233-SOL-00123 Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) Clearinghouse

Very Good

Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. Performance meets contractual requirements. The element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory. Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The element being assessed contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

Satisfactory

Marginal

Unsatisfactory

Quoters will have an opportunity to respond to adverse past performance information for which they have not previously had an opportunity to respond. Confidence Level After considering both the relevancy of the past performance and the quality of performance, an overall confidence level will be determined for each offer based on the degree of risk of unsatisfactory performance. The more relevant the references are to the current acquisition, the more significant the reference becomes and the more weight it is given in determining the confidence level. The Government will consider the work to be performed by the prime, subcontractors, key personnel, and/or major subcontractors to determine the significance of their particular past performance information when determining the confidence level. In the case of an quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the quoter will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. CONFIDENCE LEVEL EVALUATION SCHEME: Confidence Level Very Low Performance Risk Description Based on the quoter's performance record, no doubt exists that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort Based on the quoter's performance record, little doubt exists that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the quoter's performance record, some doubt exists that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort. Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems.

Low Performance Risk

Moderate Performance Risk

Page 48 of 49

Solicitation No. 15-233-SOL-00123 Low Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) Clearinghouse

High Performance Risk

Based on the quoter's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the quoter's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort. No performance record is identifiable.

Very High Performance Risk

Unknown Performance Risk

M.4 PRICE EVALUATION A price analysis will be conducted on those quotes deemed technically acceptable to determine the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed price. The Government is anticipating the use of the price analysis technique specified in FAR Part 15.305(a)(1), which allows the comparison of proposed prices received in response to the request for quote. Proposed price is not a numerically weighted factor and it is less important than the combined non-cost factors in the award decision. The Government will evaluate price quotes, not only to determine whether they are fair and reasonable, but also to determine a quoter's understanding of the SOW, and ability to meet the objectives and scope. Price, while less important than the factors mentioned above, will become more critical as technical scores approach equality. Quotes which are unrealistically low may be viewed as a failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements.

M.4.1 FAR 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS. (JUL 1990) Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). M.5 RESPONSIBILITY To be eligible for award, a Quoter must be determined responsible in accordance with the standards in FAR Part 9.104.

____________________________________________________________________________________



ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:



HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.02 per hour or $160.80 per week or $696.79 per month



VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or

successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service

includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or

successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the

performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)



HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther

King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor

Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A

contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in

accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)







THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:



1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does

not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,

administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because

most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate

not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per

week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.

400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations

within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not

list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey

data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds

$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For

example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties

within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer

occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,

then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage

determination.



Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer

industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer

professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees

who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:

    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including

consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional

specifications;

    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or

modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and

related to user or system design specifications;

    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer

programs related to machine operating systems; or

    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which

requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).



2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you

work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential

and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.

 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your

regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday

premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime

(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered

overtime work).





HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees

employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or

in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This

includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive

ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder

and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.

  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations

on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations

involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.



A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that

represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to

ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials

which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the

employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the

like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.

All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and

incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials

are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for

ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.



** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **



If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract

(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or

local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an

employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage

determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the

following standards as compliance:



The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an

adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual

cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made

the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to

this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining

agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary

affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning

and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in

those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"

materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do

not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial

laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms

of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.



The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the

"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,

unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A

links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.

gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at

http://wdol.gov/.



REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form

1444 (SF 1444)}



Conformance Process:



The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is

not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to

be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage

determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable

relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted

classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such

conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the

fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by

the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)

of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall

be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}

When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444

should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be

conformed.



The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:



1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed

occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).



2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order

proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each

proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage

rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the

authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized

representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees

performs any contract work.



3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report

of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent

information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage

and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,

for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).



4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or

disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or

notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process

the request.



5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.



6) The contractor informs the affected employees.



Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.



When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of

Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure

that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the

wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that

determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.

Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide

classifications listed in the wage determination.

Originally provided by the Social Security Administration Section 508 Program
























HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template



Purpose:



This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human Services





Background:



In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508.  The result of their collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template – a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not meet the various Section 508 Requirements.





How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized:



This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) 



The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables.  The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product’s overall “level-of-conformance” with the Section 508 Standards.  Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a Section 508 Standard is composed of.  It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not comply with a specific requirement.



Understanding the columns



Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template’s tables:

 





What information do I enter in columns 2 and 3?



The Supporting Features and Remarks/Explanations columns are used to document exactly how a product did or did not meet the Section 508 Standards. 

















Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template:



To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company’s technical specialist for the product being sought for purchase.  HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses.  Once you have enlisted their assistance:



Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C – 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D – 1194.41) sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template. 



For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements.



Using the information found in the  section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.



If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support the standard.



If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability. 



If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly how the product did not meet the standard.  



Once documented in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how the product did or did not meet, return to the Summary Table and document the product’s overall “level-of-conformance” in each of the applicable sections.



Post the final Section 508 Evaluation Template on your company's web site or on the . 

 

It is the Vendor's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data on the Section 508 Evaluation Template. The information provided on the Section 508 Evaluation Template is considered a self-representation unless expressly affirmed otherwise. Even so, HHS uses this form to complete required Market Research associated with the agency complying with Section 508 and may use the form to eliminate this product compared to other more accessible products that meet the HHS business needs.



* Please Note:  Any WEB application being purchased by HHS also requires the Vendor to complete Section 1194.21 of the Section 508 Evaluation Template in addition to Sections 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41.





HHS reserves the right to reject a PAT and corresponding proposal/offering if the answers do not address the standards.  HHS needs the PAT to address the standards in order to evaluate it for conformance.



Please answer honestly and be prepared to work with HHS to improve accessibility for your product if it is purchased.



Submission of this documentation constitutes a warrant on behalf of the vendor of the conformance of their product.  Remediation of a product or service to the specified conformance shall be the responsibility of the vendor.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed End Product Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] (1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-- (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)

Past Performance Questionnaire Appendix B ­ PERFORMANCE AREA DEFINITIONS The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations. Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes. The performance areas and definitions used in this questionnaire are identical to those used in CPARS.
Quality of Product/Service ­ Assess the contractor's conformance to contract/order requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). For example: Are reports/data accurate? Does the product or service provided meet the specifications of the contract/order? Does the Contractor's work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards? Assess the degree of customer (Government or Commercial) technical direction required to solve problems that arise during performance. For Operations Support: Assess how successfully the contractor meets program quality objectives such as ability to produce, reliability, maintainability and ability to inspect. The evaluator must be flexible in how contractor success is measured; e.g., using data from field reliability and maintainability and failure reports, user comments, and acceptance rates, and scrap and rework rates. Did the contractor demonstrate continuous improvement, quality and reliability leadership that reflects progress in quality management? Schedule ­ Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the competition of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). This evaluation of the contractor's adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor's efforts during the evaluation period that contributes to or effects the schedule variance. This element applies to contract/order closeout activities as well as contract performance. Instances of adverse actions such as assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract/order schedule and should therefore be noted in the evaluation. Cost Control (Not required for Firm Fixed Price or Firm Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment) ­ Assess the contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract/order cost. For example, does the contractor keep within the total estimated cost (what is the relationship of the negotiated costs and budgeted costs to actuals)? Did the contractor do anything innovative that resulted in cost savings? Were billings current, accurate and complete? Are the contractor's budgetary internal controls adequate? Business Relations ­ Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract/order, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts. Include, as applicable, information on the following: ˇ Is the contractor oriented toward the customer? ˇ Is interaction between the contractor and the customer satisfactory or does it need improvement? ˇ Include the adequacy of the contractor's accounting, billing, and estimating systems and the contractor's management of customer property if a substantial amount of property has been provided to the contractor under the contract/order.

Past Performance Questionnaire
ˇ Address the timeliness of awards to subcontractors and management of subcontractors, including subcontract costs. Consider efforts taken to ensure early identification of subcontract problems and the timely application of corporate resources to preclude subcontract problems from impacting overall prime contractor performance. Assess the prime contractor's effort devoted to managing subcontracts and whether subcontractors were an integral part of the contractor's team.

ˇ

Management of key Personnel (Applicable when the contract/order contains a Key Personnel clause) ­ Assess the contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. For example, how well did the contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract/order, with the person who filled the key position/ Di the contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively ? If a key person did not perform well, what action was taken by the contractor to correct this? If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract/order schedule? Utilization of Small Business (Applicable only to Government contracts with small business clauses) ­ FAR subpart 19.7 and 15 U.S.C. 637 contain statutory requirements for complying with the Small Business subcontracting Program. Assess whether the Contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Businesses to participate in contract/order performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract/order. Assess compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract/order relating to Small Business participation (including FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small businesses and FAR 52.219-9, small b=business Subcontracting Plan (when required)). Assess any Small Business participation goals, to include AbilityOne goals, which are stated separately in the contract/order. Assess achievement on each individual goal stated within the contract/order of subcontracting plan including good faith effort if the goal was not achieved.
